16,cds will not fit in these drawers. i thought this would be perfect to store cds. two rows in each drawer with the titles up so i can see them. but alas they are a quarter of an inch too short. i may try adjusting the liner by lowering it 1/4. and then sanding 1/4 off the bottom of each drawer front. if i ruin it - no matter since i can’t use it as it is. nice - but falls short for my purpose.,"['cds', 'drawers', 'liner', 'drawer front', 'bottom', 'purpose', 'drawer', 'matter']"
17,"top & bottom shelves are. top & bottom shelves are a wood based material, and are supposed to be screwed onto the shelves. unfortunately, i didn't have a drill and the material is super dense, so i wasn't able to use a punch to create a pilot hole for the screws. the other issue i ran into, it was a me problem most likely, was that 2 of the posts have holes that need to be aligned with each other - but are otherwise identical. i missed this fact, despite reading the instructions before attempting assembly, and had to partially disassemble the unit to correct the mistake. nice aesthetic, overall.","['wood', 'bottom shelves', 'material', 'unit', 'issue', 'fact', 'instructions', 'shelves']"

21,"you need to buy these. i love my kallax shelves. i actually bought five of them in various sizes. so many things i love about these shelves (in no particular order). 1. they look great. they're clean and simple. 2. the separate pieces are quite light but the unit is very sturdy when it's put together correctly. 3. it's easy to put together. if you get stuck trying to assemble it, you can always find help. 4. the units don't have that annoying particle board backing. i love this because my freshly painted walls aren't covered up by the unattractive backing and it makes it so convenient to plug stuff in. 5. they are so versatile. you can buy fabric totes or drawers or cabinet doors to put in the squares for added flexibility and storage options. this is actually what sold me on these shelves. ikea sells a cat bed that you can put in the squares (who knew?) and i have one in my kallax. 6. they are super affordable compared to other cabinets and storage units. trust me, i scoured the internet for weeks. 7. my star wars collection looks great in my kallax units and i am very happy with them.","['ikea', 'kallax', 'annoying particle board backing', 'kallax units', 'various sizes', 'star wars collection', 'many things', 'unattractive backing']"
22,"before you buy it, do this. go to the store and look at the display units, specifically the doors. chances are the door on the right hangs down a quarter inch lower than the other one. not knowing this, i purchased this unit and spent about an hour assembling it, only to find that the doors do not line up. if you are okay with the doors looking broken because one hangs down, then this is a nice looking piece. i am giving it one star though because of all my wasted time, which includes assembling it, disassembling it, and waiting in line a half hour to return it. if you read the reviews, you will see other people saying the exact same thing. the problem with the doors goes back over a year, and apparently is fine by ikea. i emailed them and the response was a one sentence apology and a pre-written copy of their return policy. i am a big fan of ikea, but this is the first time i’ve been amazed by their quality control.","['ikea', 'first time', 'display units', 'sentence apology', 'big fan', 'time', 'quality control', 'return policy']"
