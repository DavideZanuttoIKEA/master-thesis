high gloss stunner!. i have come to the conclusion that everything should be made in high gloss. it's just so great! it makes this standard bookshelf so much more luxurious to look at - reflecting the light and making the piece seem richer and more expensive than it was. i love the ones i have and would get them again and again.;High gloss finish - Positive, luxurious look - Positive, reflect light - Positive, richer appearance - Positive.
Installation Easy, but.... The tiny wooden dowels are so annoying. Without them breaking, this would be an extremely easy project. However, they did keep breaking, so what would have been an afternoon turned into a few weeks while waiting for parts and having to drill out the old dowels. After that was solved, it went together easy, and looks great in my room.;Easy installation - Positive, annoying dowels - Negative.
Took work to install.. While the doors are good, installing them was rough. The Kallax units do not have areas for the door hinge, so you have to make your own. This made things a bit difficult.;Difficult installation - Negative, good doors - Neutral, no hinge areas - Neutral.

You need to buy these. I love my Kallax shelves. I actually bought five of them in various sizes. So many things I love about these shelves (in no particular order). 1. They look great. They're clean and simple. 2. The separate pieces are quite light but the unit is very sturdy when it's put together correctly. 3. It's easy to put together. If you get stuck trying to assemble it, you can always find help. 4. The units don't have that annoying particle board backing. I love this because my freshly painted walls aren't covered up by the unattractive backing and it makes it so convenient to plug stuff in. 5. They are so versatile. You can buy fabric totes or drawers or cabinet doors to put in the squares for added flexibility and storage options. This is actually what sold me on these shelves. IKEA sells a cat bed that you can put in the squares (who knew?) and I have one in my Kallax. 6. They are super affordable compared to other cabinets and storage units.

Makeshift Lingerie Dresser. Great price compared to similar products at other retailers and far sturdier than ones I've tested. Since they stopped making the Hemnes lingerie dresser, I needed something when we replaced out bedroom set. This is working as a great temporary fix with fabric bins.

Great addition to craft room. Bought this to accompany it's 3 cube x 4 cube shelf unit sister. Product is good. Delivery was perfect. Installation was very easy. Two concerns (1) Screw heads are visible which severely limit the aesthetics, and (2) DO follow the instructions to a T. We tried to get ahead of ourselves (after just having installed the larger 3x4 unit), and started to place dowels in all of the connecting holes (just like the larger unit), until we ran out, and then discovered that this smaller unit doesn't use all drill holes.

Perfect replacements for large bulky dressers. We have a pretty small living space in our bedrooms.

Top Quality product. Top Quality product;" Top Quality - Positive (sentiment is explicitly stated)

(There is no additional keyphrase in the given sentence, it is just repeated ""Top Quality"" statement)"
Top & bottom shelves are. Top & bottom shelves are a wood based material, and are supposed to be screwed onto the shelves. Unfortunately, I didn't have a drill and the material is super dense, so I wasn't able to use a punch to create a pilot hole for the screws.  The other issue I ran into, it was a me problem most likely, was that 2 of the posts have holes that need to be aligned with each other - but are otherwise identical. I missed this fact, despite reading the instructions before attempting assembly, and had to partially disassemble the unit to correct the mistake.  Nice aesthetic, overall.; Wood based shelves - Neutral, screwed onto the brackets - Neutive, dense material - Neutral, pilot holes for screws - Negative, alignment of holes - Negative, nice aesthetic - Positive.
Before you buy it, do this. Go to the store and look at the display units, specifically the doors. Chances are the door on the right hangs down a quarter inch lower than the other one. Not knowing this, I purchased this unit and spent about an hour assembling it, only to find that the doors do not line up. If you are okay with the doors looking broken because one hangs down, then this is a nice looking piece. I am giving it one star though because of all my wasted time, which includes assembling it, disassembling it, and waiting in line a half hour to return it. If you read the reviews, you will see other people saying the exact same thing. The problem with the doors goes back over a year, and apparently is fine by Ikea. I emailed them and the response was a one sentence apology and a pre-written copy of their return policy. I am a big fan of Ikea, but this is the first time I‚Äôve been amazed by their quality control.; Doors don't line up - Negative, display units - neutral, wasted time - Negative.

CDs will not fit in these drawers. I thought this would be perfect to store CDs. Two rows in each drawer with the titles up so I can see them. But alas they are a quarter of an inch too short. I may try adjusting the liner by lowering it 1/4. And then sanding 1/4 off the bottom of each drawer front. If I ruin it - no matter since I can‚Äôt use it as it is. Nice - but falls short for my purpose.; not fitting CDs - Negative, two rows in each drawer - Positive, nice but falls short - Neutral.
Stores and organizes sewing and craft supplies. They were easy to put together but it takes two people.   I wanted to make it easier to move around my art studio. I glue a square piece of cardboard (exact size of the bottom), attached 4 wheels to the bottom of the self unit.   I have white Kuggis boxes with lids with different supplies on the shelves.

Decent for the price. The Kallax is lighter than I expected, and the instructions are not super helpful. If they showed in which direction the raw edges should face, that would have made it easier.

Love love love eket!. When we redid our daughters‚Äô room we needed to replace their Kallax bookshelf with something only slightly narrower. I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the eket is smaller, it holds way more books! This would be because the inner and outer walls are thinner. The eket takes some more muscle to put together than kallax but you can get more functionality from the eket. Plus we liked that they have backs so our kids don‚Äôt lose things in the abyss behind the unit. Also included are the stand-off posts so it can be flush against your floor trim and the wall!

Great. Divides living area and bedroom area. I think I am living on Pinerest;Divides living area and bedroom area - Positive.
Attractive, precise and useful storage.. I seriously don't understand how people found this difficult to put together. This was one of the *easiest* Ikea products I have ever put together, and I've done expedit, dressers, shelves, etc. This is ridiculously simple and for having pretty much no metal hardware is exceptionally precise in the way it goes together. For someone who is particular about details, symmetry and things being square and level, I was super impressed with the way this went together (bought the base for this and that was also simple and well engineered). Highly recommended! I just wish they offered the 2 cube model in colors other than white.

Good shelf - terrible assembly. It took me two hours to get this together. It is very difficult screwing the screws in - which is basically the entire assembly process. Some I couldn‚Äôt even get in all the way. My hands were all scraped up and sore post-assembly. Worth it for the price, but if you aren‚Äôt on a budget, you‚Äôll probably want something else.;Good shelter - Neutral, terrible assembly - Negative, difficult screws - Negative, two hour assembly - Negative, worth it for the price - Neutral.

Loved it!. I bought this table to setve as a hall table in my foyer. I love the mix of metal with wood! Its industrial yet a little rustic looking which totally fits my style. My only qualm is that one of the cabinet drawers doesn't line up just right, and it seems to be a manufacturing issue. That issue is not a big deal, though because the door still seems to latch on to the magnet and close. I'm super happy with my purchase, and as usual can't wait for my next trip put to IKEA.;Hall table - Positive, industrial look - Positive, rustic look - Positive, cabinet drawer - Neutral (with a Manufacturing issue mentioned but not seen as a major concern).
