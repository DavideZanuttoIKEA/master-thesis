70301542|Quality|"Here are the reviews that mention the topic of ""Quality"":

1. ""Good & long-lasting but needs better options.. We still have one bought back in 2005!!! That's over 12 years and no peeling or breakages despite it has been holding quite a number of books and the overall weight was rather hefty (although we did put the heaviest at the bottom and lightest at the top). We recently purchased a second unit with the intention to put it on wheels. If you think about doing the same, I would not go that route unless you plan to use it only for lightweight items, not books. Even with 1/2 the books it could hold per square, the whole structure would be far too heavy to use the wheels provided by Ikea.  We actually added solid wood strips some 5 inches wide running front to back at the bottom and stained them in a dark color. The strip have been attached with screws on the frame of the bottom plank (the center of the base is hollow). Those served as support for the wheels which added separately as they had a higher load rating (still ikea ones), but even then the solution wasn't a viable option because the unit became too flimsy feeling when under load and would be unreliable for use with heavy items. **The unit is still sturdy and well-built, but the wheels are a bit of a letdown**.""

2. ""What a value. Very happy with the solid construction for storing books and LP records. A great organizer in a compact space. **The quality is excellent, it's sturdy and well-made**.""

3. ""Incredibly Useful and Show Piece. I absolutely love this storage piece. Not only is it incredibly functional it's also beautiful! The dark wood plus being able to display whatever I need I know I will be using this for years to come. Currently it is in our bedroom and provides ample storage for everyday things that we can keep in bins, use some for display of sentimental items, and books and DVDs. **The quality is top-notch, it's sturdy and well-made**.""

4. ""LAST A LIFETIME!. We have had ours for over a decade, and it's still in great shape! We've used it for a number of things, moved it allover the house, and it is just as sturdy as when we first bought it. **The quality is exceptional, it's built to last**."""
70301542|Ease of Assembly|"1. **Super easy to assemble!!. We thought we were going to spend a whole day building this. Only took a couple hours. Very nice piece.** 
2. **Practically Perfect. Bought this for my son's new teenager room. We only had one wall available, so we needed a LOT of storage and versatility. The Kallax series works great for us - lots of options, sturdy build, and it holds nearly everything (really tall things go on top!). I put this piece together by myself, except for the very last step where I needed to tilt the whole case to put in the last two screws. But one resourceful person could probably do it - it's really easy to assemble.**
3. **Easy assembly. Great finish & fit, does what it supposed to.** 
4. **I surprisingly was able to. I surprisingly was able to put this together by myself and just needed my husband to help me lift it up off the floor. Love how it looks! Great value for the price.**"

No mess, no mess!!!!! ❤️"" - The review highlights the product's appearance and how it looks beautiful in the living room.
4. ""It's a great storage unit for vinyl records. I replaced wall shelves with this unit. It holds more lps in less space, and keeps them upright more securely...

70301542|Sturdiness|"1. **Very sturdy and functional.** Completely filled the need I had. I was very satisfied with quality and ease of assembly.
2. **Sturdy!.** Nice piece! Super easy assembly. Feels sturdy to put all my stuff.
3. **Sturdy shelves!.** Instructions are easy to follow, packaging was GREAT & ensured there was no damage, very sturdy shelves.
4. **Super heavy - looks o.k. - generally happy.** Generally happy with this purchase. It is largely held together with dowels and slip fit, so the vertical joints creep. Looks like I thought it would. openings are perfect."
70301542|Space|"1. **Space saving, beautiful.** Used this to replace a dresser in a small house, wish we saw it sooner! Able to organize and save space! Still have ample room on it for more. The doors and drawers are fantastic. Easy to put together, Even for this old person!
2. **Perfect for a studio apartment!.** Kallax is a great to make a barrier for a studio space. We used it in my mother’s assisted living apartment and it’s made a wonder division of spaces. Easy to put together, clean and modern. Fun to design unique shapes.
3. **Great for teen bedroom.** We bought this unit for my 13yo son's room, and it's a perfect addition. It's a huge piece of furniture, so putting it together took some time and a rubber mallet to get everything tight. Then lifting it was quite a beast...definitely a two or even three person job. But it only took a couple of hours, and the result is well worth the effort.
4. **Used this to create library.** This is a great way to organize my very large book collection"
70301542|Value|"1. **What a value.** Very happy with the solid construction for storing books and LP records. A great organizer in a compact space.
2. **Tons of space for storage.** Awesome price, tons of room for storage highly recommend.
3. **Best value for money.** I would highly recommend this product, it's a great value for the price.
4. **Practically Perfect.** Bought this for my son's new teenager room... Great price. Easy to put together. Sturdy."
70301542|Material|"1. **Poorly constructed; overpriced..** This shelf replaces the far superior Besta shelf. It’s poorly constructed, flimsy and overpriced. Not recommended, even though it is one of the few inexpensive vinyl shelves available. **...the gaps that always form in the middle that is large enough to show the dowels which are supposed to connect the vertical square panels to the top closing plank...**
2. **Some issue.** When assembling, it was not perfect match with wooden plates. **...and there are some scratchs and dirts.**
3. **Cardboard inside the walls! Not solid particle board..** Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it. Ours got weaker and started to wobble, so I wanted to lay it down on its face to add metal braces to the back corners, and the thing just ripped apart under its own weight. **...the outer edge pieces are thin strips of MDF with cardboard filler!**
4. **Not good quality.** Not good quality"

1. Looks Great!. **Easy to put together, sturdy and looks great!**"
90301555|Quality|"1.**An Interesting and Useful Piece.** I didn't believe the IKEA guy when he said that it could easily hold 33 lbs. It is so lightweight, smooth and pretty, and I had no idea what it was when I saw it on my way to check out, but maybe it could solve the problem of my microwave oven cord being too short to fit any of my electric outlets while placed on any counter or current furniture. Actually, it is built to hold up to 50 lbs. 
2.**Arrived Damaged.** Usually love Ikea furniture, but it looks like these must have been damaged at some point in the factory process which was a little disappointing. Still great just not brand new out of the box which makes me wonder if quality control has gone down recently. 
3.**Cute, Sturdy, Easy to assemble.** Very versatile piece. Well made and easy to put together. I also love that there are doors, drawers, wine rack to put inside the cubes. 
4.**Sturdy practical affordable product.** Sturdy practical affordable product"
90301555|Versatility|"1. **Versatile Kallax shelving**. So easy to put together and can be used vertically or horizontally. Looks so clean. Exactly what I needed in my kitchen for extra shelving.
2. **Versatile furniture**. Love the Kallax cubes. Double cube can be used vertically or horizontally due to all sides finished the same.
3. Always a great deal. Kallax units are great storage units in all sizes! We use them in my sewing room, where I have the 5x5, 4x4 and 2x2 units, as well as our garage (where my husband customized some individual units). They are versatile and the doors and inserts allow us to tailor the Kallax to our specific needs.

90301555|Durability|"1.**Arrived Damaged.** Recently bought two of these shelve units for my new apartment and was disappointed to find that both of them had been dented in the exact same spot on one of the parts. Usually love Ikea furniture, but it looks like these must have been damaged at some point in the factory process which was a little disappointing. Still great just not brand new out of the box which makes me wonder if quality control has gone down recently. 
2.**Super.** Easy to put together, **sturdy**. Bought this and the drawers to use as a bathroom cabinet. Perfect size. Looks great. 
3.**Sturdy practical affordable product.** Sturdy practical affordable product

3.**Easy to put together. The storage unit was perfect and looks like it does and was very easy to put together. I like that it is sturdy but not heavy. I had a birthday coupon so the price was great.** 
4.**Great Purchase!.** We needed furniture while we are renting and thought that this would be a great option. We bought several different sizes of the Kalllax collection for our living room. It’s been a great choice for our needs right now and be easily used again in many different capacities. We purchased the Branas baskets and they look great! It’s all very sturdy and well made!"
69329387|Quality|"1. Drawers would not a-line. I saw this cute floating desk at my hairdressers and thought I would get one too. It has two drawers one would close the other one would not close at all! **We switched them out adjusted the rails it just wouldn’t work. So I kept the top drawer and we remove the rails from the second one. A total hassle.IKEA, you really need to make sure your products work before you sell them to the public.** (Criticism of the product's quality)
2. Looks Terrible. I’ve owned a lot of ikea furniture over the years, but this has definitely been the most frustrating ikea item I have ever built. They market it as so easy to put together, but if you mess up, good luck fixing it! **After spending almost 2hours putting it together. My drawers are crooked and one doesn’t even latch properly. I don’t even want to hang it on my wall** (Criticism of the product's quality)

I kept the cubes and just put the cube drawers I already had because ikea is still out of the plain black ones. I love ikea and have lots of their dressers and cube pieces but this one is just ok…

29278304|Ease of Assembly|"1. The design is appealing and pleasant, however, putting it together is a different story. The inserts are not made the same size or the bookcase is not accurate. Was really hard to put it together since the inserts didn't fit properly, they look uneven and for the price and standards of Ikea, I was expecting better quality. I love their products but this one was not that great. (**Hard assembly**)
2. Nice and easy. Super easy and quick to install. (**Nice and easy**)

80401292|Quality|"1. **Excellent Product.** I love this for small storage containers. It’s very well made, such a great option to add to my Kallax unit.
2. **Not sure how I feel.** I thought I had these pieces push all the way in when putting this together so when I out it in my brand new kallax cube, it scratch the white up inside. So disappointing. There should be better instructions. I even used the padding on the edges that came with it but it still scratched the paint and now my shelf has scratch marks on it. I like the divider but not what it did to my new cube. (Note: The reviewer is mentioning the quality of the product, but in a negative way)
3. **Great for wine bottles!.** fits bottles of wine perfectly. Very sturdy.
4. **An Excellent Accessory.** I already owned the shelving units and with the Kallax, I was able to convert the unit spaces into a great looking and easily accessible wine rack. It was a great solution with my limited space, and honestly it looks great."

80401292|Value|"1. **Low value for price**. A bit upset as it’s chipped in two places while careful my putting it together. It has weight to it but it’s now ugly from the chips. It took some time to get it in the init. I also would like if it had a back without having to purchase a door. The unit being opened in the back means things can fall behind it. I purchased so I can put my kids Lego cars in it.

3. **Not worth the money**. I bought this to be a temporary TV stand as the one I want is several hundred dollars. In out of stock. Directions are not very helpful as there are no step-by-step. It took my daughter and I about an hour to put it together. My only complaint is there’s a black and white tape on the edges but I can’t seem to get off.

49442676|Ease of Assembly|"1.**Instructions clearly not written to go together- look at BOTH!!.** Love the unit, but I’m extremely irritated that the instructions for the shelving unit say nothing about the underframe requiring four of the larger bolts from the unit to come out so the brackets can be installed. That information is in the instructions for the underframe. I have problems with dexterity and am none too happy about doing the work of getting those bolts in securely just to turn around and have to do it again. **Otherwise, lovely storage unit.**
2.**Perfect fit!.** I bought this as a tv stand for the guest room. I added storage cubes below and put books and a few other decorative items on the top row. The additional stand was a great addition to give it a nice touch.
3.**Looks really nice..** This shelf compliments my other office furniture and is very versatile. I decided to add inserts for more functionality, but could have easily used without them. **Not too hard to put together.**
4.**Assembly.** You really have to follow the procedures. It took us 2 hours to assemble the first shelf because we followed the guide halfway from the beginning. Since we needed to assemble 3 more shelves, we reviewed the manual again and it took us 20 minutes completing each shelf."

3.**Versatile.** I purchased the KALLAX storage for my office space. I particularly like that it can be horizontal or vertical and I can raise it up on legs. Mine is horizontal with leg base. The best part is being able to choose from several different inserts in to the cube openings to accomodate all my office storage needs (drawers, shelves, pull out bins, etc.)

3. ""Putting together was a pain. Its so difficult to put together for something that's just supposed to ""snap together"". the plastic attachment grooves on the sides don't work nor fit together perfectly so a part of the sides don't lay flat with each other.""

49189203|Instructions|"1. Doesn't come with connectors. I ordered this set as pictured- with the cubed shelf connected to the one tall one with the door. I knew this would need to be connected, but nowhere in the description or ""good to know"" section told me that I needed to order the connectors as well. **I've purchased similar furniture from IKEA in the past and connectors were provided for those. Not sure why this one doesn't come with it.**
2. Bad. it nearly impossible to assemble without destroying it, and it is totally incompatible with the glass window in the same series. **Assembly makes this piece not worth it. I bought this piece with expectations for assembly to be similar to the things I have bought from Ikea in the past - not the easiest but also not terrible if you have time and patience.**
3. Assembly makes this piece not worth it. I bought this piece with expectations for assembly to be similar to the things I have bought from Ikea in the past - not the easiest but also not terrible if you have time and patience. **However the assembly for this piece is honestly like torture. There really aren't any screws involved with this piece of furniture, just a lot of meeting the plastic ends in the holes and pushing them down to make it align.**
4. great piece for the price!. This was a piece for our guest room. worked perfectly. **Assembly is tricky when getting the corners to line up, but finally got it set.**"
80487813|Quality|"1. **Poorly-aligned holes in uprights made for a miserable assembly experience**. You'd think that drilling holes down the center of a strip of wood would be relatively easy for a manufacturer to do well -- but this shelving unit shows that IKEA is not up to the task. The holes in the uprights were sometimes centered and sometimes not, and in one case this required a bit of home woodworking (using far more in the way of tools than came in the boxes) to correct. If the price were half of what it is, I might not gripe too much -- but for this price, it's completely inexcusable for IKEA's factory to be so incredibly sloppy. It's also important to note that these shelves look to be solid slabs in the product photos, but are actually made of thin sheets of metal wrapped into square tubes at the front and back -- this means that they sag when weight is put anywhere other than the ends, front, or back of the shelves. 
2. **Sturdy shelving**. Purchased two and being used in the garage to organize boxed items to pull when needed. Sturdy shelving with enough spacing to keep boxes off the ground. Great price for our needs.
3. **Beautiful shelf!**. I am pleased with this shelf! It is a great price, easy to assemble, and has a lot of space. It also looks great!
4. **Excellent quality**. Excellent quality. Easy assembly. Fits perfectly into the interior."
80487813|Ease of Assembly|"1. **Easy to put together but flimsy.** I ended up returning because I purchased the tall version and needed the short. I’m an IKEA evangelist but I’d say this is probably twice as expensive as it should be. It’s **easy to put together** but seems very flimsy.
2. **Easy assembly.** This was perfect for my need: a closet shelf for towels and misc stuff. I did not need to secure it to wall. **Easy assembly** was a breeze.
3. **Easy to assemble.** This was perfect for my office!! Height is great and width is perfect!! I needed storage and boy did it help!!
4. **Easy to put together and is study.** Didn't take too long to put together. Instructions were easy to follow. Boxes were a bit heavy and awkward."
80487813|Appearance|"1. Cute & Functional. I love my shelf so much. My uncle painted the frame part pink to match my kitchen decor. I use it to free up space on my countertops. I put my little white retro style microwave on it, my pink toaster and pink bubblegum machine filled with chocolates. I also put 2 pans (pink of course) on the bottom shelf. I’m very pleased with my purchase. **I love my shelf so much**, **looks great**, **pink to match my kitchen decor**.

80487813|Sturdiness|"1.**Good item.** I bought this to be a temporary TV stand as the one I want is several hundred dollars. In out of stock. Directions are not very helpful as there are no step-by-step. It took my daughter and I about an hour to put it together. My only complaint is there’s a black and white tape on the edges but I can’t seem to get off. It’s very ugly and distracts me from the beauty of the item. (No mention of sturdiness)

80487813|Value|"1. **Great value for your money**. I was looking for another item i saw online but decided on purchasing this one instead when I saw it in person at the showroom. I liked that the shelves are thin metal yet very strong. The 5 shelves worked perfectly for my walk in closet space.
2. Good for the price but. Good for the price but was a little more complicated to assemble than I thought.
3. **What a POS. this product is awful**. this product is awful. No instructions. wood broke immediately. Totally garbage,. I threw it away and there's no way I'm paying for it.
4. **Good shelf that looks nice and works well**. Good shelf that looks nice and works well. I'll be buying more of this style!"
