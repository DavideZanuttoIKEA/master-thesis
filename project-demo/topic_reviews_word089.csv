70301542,Quality,"Very sturdy and functional. Completely filled the need I had. I was **very satisfied with quality and ease of** asssembly.| Good & long-lasting but needs better options.. We still have one bought back in 2005!!! That's over 12 years and no peeling or breakages despite it has been holding quite a number of books and the overall weight was rather hefty (although we did put the heaviest at the bottom and lightest at the top). We recently purchased a second unit with the intention to put it on wheels. If you think about doing the same, I would not go that route unless you plan to use it only for lightweight items, not books. Even with 1/2 the books it could hold per square, the whole structure would be far too heavy to use the wheels provided by Ikea.  We actually added solid wood strips some 5 inches wide running front to back at the bottom and stained them in a dark color. The strip have been attached with screws on the frame of the bottom plank (the center of the base is hollow). Those served as support for the wheels which added separately as they had a higher load rating (still ikea ones), but even then the solution wasn't a viable option because the unit became too flimsy feeling when under load and would be unreliable for use with heavy items. So the books went back to the old unit which we had to keep stationary and not add any wheels. And this one will be used as a movable partition for storage of lightweight items while providing some privacy on the other side of it. The plan was to use 2 of these but we had to change solution. Also during the test under load, the wheel left some scoring in our hardwood floor (apparently much less hard than the plastic of the wheels) so that was a complete deal breaker even if the unit would have reveal itself to be more stable when moved around. One aspect in which I wish the design would have been revised is to see the gaps that always form in the middle that is large enough to show the dowels which are supposed to connect the vertical square panels to the top closing plank. A 3rd screw might also help make the frame a bit more rigid. Mind you that we have not clued anything together to be able to disassemble as needed... so with that considered it's still a pretty sturdy construction given its price **point and overall quality construction**. We haven't needed to use the anchoring (we also have no kids or pets in the house), but we'd recommend it if you live in areas with seismic activity or have kids and pets, even if you don't load the unit all that much. I wish it had better options (like a set of 8 softer and high-load carrying wheels) as well as a better design for the insert with door, which ends up having a very poor fit in many cases and will need to be heavily tweaked making it the more time intensive assembling task... they should be redesigned and changed to a thin frame holding the swinging panel door with small pins acting as stops to prevent the door from traveling inwards more than it should. The back plate could be much the same as long as machining will be kept as precise as possible. That said, if you use this as simple shelving unit to hold some books and display small object, it will serve you for years if not decades to come.| bookshelf. Love this bookshelf, my husband put it together fairly easily. **It’s quality and salad**. I made a mistake, grabbing the box of white color at the store and I wanted black but I want to say that I love the white as the base and top ! it was a good mistake.| Kallax Shelving Unit. Great product. **Good quality**"
70301542,Ease of Assembly,
70301542,Appearance,"Nice product. I would love to see them add a way to secure them to each other on the sides but **over all it looks** great.| Love the modularity. **I love the look of the shelf** unit, assembly was very easy, and the idea of modules which are drawers, cabinets, or baskets is pure genius. Unfortunately it is not very stable and I suspect that it will need bracing before too long for it not to collapse.| Love this! All is hidden. I do a lot of arts and crafts and this helped me organize all my materials. Also, **looks beautiful in my** living room and no one can see what is inside. No mess, no mess!!!!! ❤️| Nearly perfect shelving unit. Firstly, I love my Kallax shelf unit. It works perfectly as a room divider for a **small apartment and looks great overall**. Definitely need at least two people to assemble, if only for the part where you sit the shelving unit right side up. I would give it five stars, however, multiple pieces arrived damaged (paint chipped off, multiple ~2 in gouges in the particle board). I'm sure Ikea would have replaced the damaged parts, but I was already at my wit's end after trying to return another item over the course of four weeks."
70301542,Functionality,"**Very sturdy and functional**. Completely filled the need I had. I was very satisfied with quality and ease of asssembly.| **Great function and appearance for** the value!. Shelving unit is incredibly easy to assemble and sturdy! Eventually we will add on the accessories i.e. drawers and doors and lights.| **Incredibly Useful and Show Piece**. I absolutely love this storage piece. Not only **is it incredibly functional it's also** beautiful! The dark wood plus being able to display whatever I need I know I will be using this for years to come. Currently it is in our bedroom and provides ample storage for everyday things that we can keep in bins, use some for display of sentimental items, and books and DVDs. It's **Great and so functional**| **Useful as an alternative** to a dresser. I bought this along with the DRONA boxes and use it in place of a dresser. The 25 individual boxes allow me to be super organized. It looks great. We bought black with the black boxes and are very happy with it."
70301542,Sturdiness,"Perfect for vinyl record storage. Must mount it though. This is perfect for my album collection. I used metal wall anchors from the hardware store to mount all four corners to the wall. I have about 900 vinyl albums and this holds them perfectly. As always follow the directions. Assembling on a carpet using a level are important. I also added wood glue to all the dowels **so they stay solid**. | Love the modularity. I love the look of the shelf unit, assembly was very easy, and the idea of modules which are drawers, cabinets, or baskets is pure genius. Unfortunately it **is not very stable and I suspect** that it will need bracing before too long for it not to collapse.| Cardboard inside the walls! **Not solid particle** board.. Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it. Ours got weaker and started to wobble, so I wanted to lay it down on its face to add metal braces to the back corners, and the thing just ripped apart under its own weight. I am glad it did because I can see now that the outer edge pieces are thin strips of MDF with cardboard filler! I can't believe they can sell this as a safe product.| **Solid as expected**. Easy to put together. I added 3 2x4’s horizontal on the back to reinforce it, and screed the 2x4’s on studs in the wall. **It’s nice and solid and ready for** a large LP collection."
70301542,Space,"**Space** saving, beautiful. Used this to replace a dresser in a small house, wish we saw it sooner! Able to **organize and save space! Still have ample** room on it for more. The doors and drawers are fantastic. 
Easy to put together , Even for this old person!| Love this! All is hidden. I do a lot of arts and crafts and this helped me organize all my materials.

I'm sure Ikea would have replaced the damaged parts, but I was already at my wit's end after trying to return another item over the course of four weeks.| Lots of storage. I needed a lot of storage for my comic book boxes and this fit the bill. Could have been a little deeper but really worked well and looks great. Easy to put together my 14 and 12 yr old boys did it with little help. You need **a lot of space for this one** as it is big to put together on the ground but easy and looks good."
70301542,Value,"Wonderful for boardgames. Kallax is the premier shelving unit for storing boardgames. Sturdy, long lasting, ability to hold many, many games. **Great price for value.**| **What a value**. Very happy with the solid construction for storing books and LP records. A great organizer in a compact space.| I surprisingly was able to. I surprisingly was able to put this together by myself and just needed my husband to help me lift it up off the floor. Love how it looks! **Great value for the** price.| Organizing Behemoth. I had a TaskRabbit person assemble this, but he did it quickly (an hour or less) and only needed my assistance holding it up to install the grounding hardware (err... walling hardware? whatever those pieces are to make sure a 200 pound shelf doesn't come crashing down on you). I meant to get the 4 x 4 one not the 5 x 5 one, but turns out I needed those 9 extra KALLAX cubes and that way I can decorate them them in fun ways too. I wish some of the inserts/organizers weren't so expensive, but the shelf as is, **is a great value**. I was surprised the parts fit in my Jeep Renegade and man it was difficult to get 66 lbs upstairs on my own (there are 4 boxes- 2 are 33 pounds, 2 are 66 pounds), but I did it. Now I want to replace an old book shelf I have with the 4 x 4 that can also double as a room divider."
70301542,Material,"Love this! All is hidden. I do a lot of arts and crafts and this helped me **organize all my materials**. Also, looks beautiful in my living room and no one can see what is inside. No mess, no mess!!!!! ❤️| Very nice, **big and good material**. Exactly what we were looking for. Big enough and looks nice in my bedroom| Perfect for my space. I bought this about a month ago in black and it overpowered the room! So I utilized ikeas great return policy and got the walnut look alike instead. It fits all my art supplies. Fiber arts, metals, ceramics, painting, **and print making materials.**| Serves the purpose. **Very cheap material**. Putting it together chipped some of the wood."

90301555,Quality,"Arrived Damaged. Recently bought two of these shelve units for my new apartment and was disappointed to find that both of them had been dented in the exact same spot on one of the parts. Usually love Ikea furniture, but it looks like these must have been damaged at some point in the factory process which was a little disappointing.

90301555,Functionality,"**An Interesting and Useful Piece**. I didn't believe the IKEA guy when he said that it could easily hold 33 lbs. It is so lightweight, smooth and pretty, and I had no idea what it was when I saw it on my way to check out, but maybe it could solve the problem of my microwave oven cord being too short to fit any of my electric outlets while placed on any counter or current furniture. Actually, it is built to hold up to 50 lbs. It fit under the end of my breakfast bar near the electric outlet, and my microwave fits neatly on top.

We set ours up vertically. The hardware kit comes with two shelf braces, so the table doesn't rely too heavily on the wood shelf it's mounted on. The bookshelf also comes with wall anchors which I highly recommend if you have children using this. It was easy to install. Took a little bit of effort to level the legs. TIP: to start, lay the table face down with legs up and adjust the height of the legs to the shelf that you want to mount to. From there, when you flip it, you can adjust and level. All holes are pre-drilled for you except where the table bracket mounts to the shelf and where the braces will mount under each shelf, but the little screws are pretty well-self tapping. I piloted the first few and then found out I can just put pressure and turn them in manually.
