70301542,Quality,"Perfect for vinyl record storage. Must mount it though. This is perfect for my album collection. I used metal wall anchors from the hardware store to mount all four corners to the wall. I have about 900 vinyl albums and this holds them perfectly. As always follow the directions. Assembling on a carpet using a level are important. I also added wood glue to all the dowels **so they stay solid**. | **Nice product**. I would love to see them add a way to secure them to each other on the sides but over all it looks great.| Space saving, beautiful. Used this to replace a dresser in a small house, wish we saw it sooner! Able to organize and save space! Still have ample room on it for more. The doors **and drawers are fantastic**. 
Easy to put together , Even for this old person!| Cardboard inside **the walls! Not solid particle board.**. Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it. Ours got weaker and started to wobble, so I wanted to lay it down on its face to add metal braces to the back corners, and the thing just ripped apart under its own weight. I am glad it did because I can see now that the outer edge pieces are thin strips of MDF with cardboard filler! I can't believe they can sell this as a safe product."
70301542,Ease of Assembly,"Kallak shelves are excellent.. We have 5 of these shelving units in our house.  My wife uses them for her art supplies.  They were delivered to my house and brought upstairs.  **Assembly is easy**.  Great units.| Perfect for vinyl record storage. Must mount it though. This is perfect for my album collection.

As always follow the directions. **Assembling on a carpet** using a level are important. I also added wood glue to all the dowels so they stay solid. | Love the modularity. I love the look of **the shelf unit, assembly was very easy,** and the idea of modules which are drawers, cabinets, or baskets is pure genius. Unfortunately it is not very stable and I suspect that it will need bracing before too long for it not to collapse.| Dowels do not fit into shelves. I've put together several of the smaller Kallax shelves over the year with no problem. Unfortunately, with this unit the dowels are too large and do not fit in the shelves. I called to complain after ruining a couple of the shelves and dowels, was sent a new one and had the same problem. I had to redrill all the holes so the dowels would fit - very time consuming for what should **be an easy assembly**. Noticed this complaint in other reviews and should have paid attention."

I do a lot of arts and crafts and this helped me organize all my materials. **Also, looks beautiful in my** living room and no one can see what is inside. No mess, no mess!!!!! ❤️| Nearly perfect shelving unit. Firstly, I love my Kallax shelf unit. It works perfectly as a room divider for a **small apartment and looks great overall**. Definitely need at least two people to assemble, if only for the part where you sit the shelving unit right side up. I would give it five stars, however, multiple pieces arrived damaged (paint chipped off, multiple ~2 in gouges in the particle board). I'm sure Ikea would have replaced the damaged parts, but I was already at my wit's end after trying to return another item over the course of four weeks."

70301542,Value,"Good & long-lasting but needs better options.. We still have one bought back in 2005!!! That's over 12 years and no peeling or breakages despite it has been holding quite a number of books and the overall weight was rather hefty (although we did put the heaviest at the bottom and lightest at the top). We recently purchased a second unit with the intention to put it on wheels. If you think about doing the same, I would not go that route unless you plan to use it only for lightweight items, not books. Even with 1/2 the books it could hold per square, the whole structure would be far too heavy to use the wheels provided by Ikea.  We actually added solid wood strips some 5 inches wide running front to back at the bottom and stained them in a dark color. The strip have been attached with screws on the frame of the bottom plank (the center of the base is hollow). Those served as support for the wheels which added separately as they had a higher load rating (still ikea ones), but even then the solution wasn't a viable option because the unit became too flimsy feeling when under load and would be unreliable for use with heavy items. So the books went back to the old unit which we had to keep stationary and not add any wheels. And this one will be used as a movable partition for storage of lightweight items while providing some privacy on the other side of it. The plan was to use 2 of these but we had to change solution. Also during the test under load, the wheel left some scoring in our hardwood floor (apparently much less hard than the plastic of the wheels) so that was a complete deal breaker even if the unit would have reveal itself to be more stable when moved around. One aspect in which I wish the design would have been revised is to see the gaps that always form in the middle that is large enough to show the dowels which are supposed to connect the vertical square panels to the top closing plank. A 3rd screw might also help make the frame a bit more rigid. Mind you that we have not clued anything together to be able to disassemble as needed... so with that considered it's still a pretty sturdy **construction given its price point and overall** quality construction. We haven't needed to use the anchoring (we also have no kids or pets in the house), but we'd recommend it if you live in areas with seismic activity or have kids and pets, even if you don't load the unit all that much. I wish it had better options (like a set of 8 softer and high-load carrying wheels) as well as a better design for the insert with door, which ends up having a very poor fit in many cases and will need to be heavily tweaked making it the more time intensive assembling task... they should be redesigned and changed to a thin frame holding the swinging panel door with small pins acting as stops to prevent the door from traveling inwards more than it should. The back plate could be much the same as long as machining will be kept as precise as possible. That said, if you use this as simple shelving unit to hold some books and display small object, it will serve you for years if not decades to come.| Best **Bookcases for the money**. I have purchased 10 Kallax bookcases in various configurations. My husband is a book collector and likes the fact that you can put books on both sides just like library. The current on is the biggest we have purchased and will be used as a room divider.| Wonderful for boardgames. Kallax is the premier shelving unit for storing boardgames. Sturdy, long lasting, ability to hold many, many games. **Great price for value.**| **What a value**. Very happy with the solid construction for storing books and LP records. A great organizer in a compact space."

Nearly finished building it when one of the screws simply would not screw in so tried to turn it to try a different angle, and a bunch **of the connecting wood pieces snapped and** lodged inside the shelves, impossible to get out. So can't finish putting it together and wasted the $270. Just terrible.| Love this! All is hidden. I do a lot of arts and crafts and this helped me **organize all my materials**.

90301555,Quality,"Arrived Damaged. Recently bought two of these shelve units for my new apartment and was disappointed to find that both of them had been dented in the exact same spot on one of the parts. Usually love Ikea furniture, but it looks like these must have been damaged at some point in the factory process which was a little disappointing. Still great just not brand new out of the box which makes **me wonder if quality control has gone** down recently.| UGH!. The only IKEA is nearly forty minutes from me. I bought this item and decided to put it together today. What should’ve taken about ten minutes to assemble with minimal effort ended up taking nearly an hour and an unnecessary amount of work. All because the two side panels are reverse threaded on every side. When tightening the screws, the screws go perfectly into the top and bottom and repel the two inserts. It makes putting the two pieces together nearly impossible. Unfortunately I’m too busy working and gas is too expensive to return this item, especially **since there’s no guarantee whichever piece I** purchase won’t be the same or worse. Very inconvenient.| Worked well. Did the job I **needed and looks good**. Also got two baskets (Labbsal).| ****Sturdy practical affordable product****. ****Sturdy practical affordable product****"

Double cube can be used vertically or horizontally due to all sides finished the same.| Always a great deal. Kallax units are great storage units in all sizes! We use them in my sewing room, where I have the 5x5, 4x4 and 2x2 units, as well as our garage (where my husband customized some individual units). **They are versatile and the doors** and inserts allow us to tailor the Kallax to our specific needs.| Cute, Sturdy, Easy to assemble. **Very versatile piece**.

Love it!| **Cost effective, flexible and** attractive. I used two units. One horizontally below a window and butted it against another unit vertically creating a corner L shape which combined both storage and open cubes. The open back allows access to the electrical outlet under the window, and the storage flexibility is simply outstanding. We used the Ratan inserts and doors and drawers and open cubes. Looks fantastic for about **10% of the cost of custom units**. Assembly was straightforward, I got really fast on the drawers by the time I was finished!| Versatile Bookcase with lots of accessories.. This is my second one of these. The first had 25 cubes. This was a lot easier to assemble. As always it fit together precisely and works vertically or horizontally. The accessories (I added lots of drawers) would get tedious unless you use a drill/driver set on low torque. **But it was worth it for the** finished product.

We set ours up vertically. The hardware kit comes with two shelf braces, so the table doesn't rely too heavily on the wood shelf it's mounted on. The bookshelf also comes with wall anchors which I highly recommend if you have children using this. It was easy to install. Took a little bit of effort to level the legs. TIP: to start, lay the table face down with legs up and adjust the height of the legs to the shelf that you want to mount to. From there, when you flip it, you can adjust and level. All holes are pre-drilled for you except where the table bracket mounts to the shelf and where the braces will mount under each shelf, but the little screws are pretty well-self tapping. I piloted the first few and then found out I can just put pressure and turn them in manually.

I’m very pleased with my purchase.| Easy to **put together but flimsy**. I ended up returning because I purchased the tall version and needed the short. I’m an IKEA evangelist but I’d say this is probably twice as expensive as it should be. It’s easy to put together **but seems very flimsy**. I didn’t end up buying the shorter one.| Poorly-aligned holes in uprights made for a miserable assembly experience.. You'd think that drilling holes down the center of a strip of wood would be relatively easy for a manufacturer to do well -- but this shelving unit shows that IKEA is not up to the task. The holes in the uprights were sometimes centered and sometimes not, and in one case this required a bit of home woodworking (using far more in the way of tools than came in the boxes) to correct. If the price were half of what it is, I might not gripe too much -- but for this price, it's completely inexcusable for IKEA's factory to be so incredibly sloppy. It's also important to note that these shelves **look to be solid slabs in the** product photos, but are actually made of thin sheets of metal wrapped into square tubes at the front and back -- this means that they sag when weight is put anywhere other than the ends, front, or back of the shelves.| Easy assembly. This was perfect for my need: a closet shelf for towels and misc stuff. I did **not need to secure it to wall**. Sparks joy!"

Purchased two and being used in the garage to organize boxed items to pull when needed. Sturdy shelving with enough spacing to keep boxes off the ground. **Great price for our needs.**| Ample shelf space. **Great value for your money.**. I was looking for another item i saw online but decided on purchasing this one instead when I saw it in person at the showroom. I liked that the shelves are thin metal yet very strong. The 5 shelves worked perfectly for my walk in closet space.| **Good for the price but**. **Good for the price but** was a little more complicated to assemble than I thought."
