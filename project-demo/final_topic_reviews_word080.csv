Assembly is easy.  **Great units.**| Perfect **for vinyl record storage**. Must mount it though. This is perfect **for my album collection**. I used metal wall anchors from the hardware store to mount all four corners to the wall. I have about 900 vinyl albums and this holds them perfectly. As always follow the directions. Assembling on a **carpet using a level are important**. I also added wood glue to all the dowels **so they stay solid**. | **Nice product**. I would love to see them add **a way to secure them to each** other on the sides but over all it looks great.| Space saving, beautiful. Used this to replace a dresser in a small house, wish we saw it sooner! Able to organize and save space! Still have ample room on it for more. The doors **and drawers are fantastic**.

As always follow the directions. **Assembling on a carpet** using a level are important. I also added wood glue to all the dowels so they stay solid. | Love the modularity. I love the look of the shelf unit, **assembly was very easy,** and the idea of modules which are drawers, cabinets, or baskets is pure genius. Unfortunately it is not very stable and I suspect that it will need bracing before too long for it not to collapse.| Dowels do not fit into shelves. I've put together several of the smaller Kallax shelves over the year with no problem. Unfortunately, with this unit the dowels are too large and do not fit in the shelves. I called to complain after ruining a couple of the shelves and dowels, was sent a new one and had the same problem. I had to redrill all the holes so the dowels would fit - very time consuming for what should **be an easy assembly**. Noticed this complaint in other reviews and should have paid attention."

Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it. Ours got weaker and started to wobble, so I wanted to lay it **down on its face to add metal** braces to the back corners, and the thing just ripped apart under its own weight. I am glad it did because I can see now that the outer edge pieces are thin strips of MDF with cardboard filler! I can't believe they can sell this as a safe product.| **Excellent and elegant**.

Completely filled the need I had. I was **very satisfied with quality and ease of** asssembly.| Nearly perfect shelving unit. Firstly, I love my Kallax shelf unit. It works perfectly as a room divider for a small apartment and looks great overall. Definitely need at least two people to assemble, if only for the part where you sit the shelving unit right side up. I would give it five stars, however, multiple pieces arrived damaged (paint chipped off, multiple ~2 in gouges in the particle board). I'm sure Ikea would have replaced the damaged parts, but I was already at my wit's end after trying **to return another item over the course** of four weeks."

Nearly finished building it when one of the screws simply would not screw in so tried to turn it to try a different angle, and a bunch **of the connecting wood pieces snapped and** lodged inside the shelves, impossible to get out. So can't finish putting it together and wasted the $270. Just terrible.| **Cardboard inside the walls!** Not solid particle board.. Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it.

90301555,Quality,"Perfect bedside table. **I used the unit as a bedside** table. Fits the decor perfectly.| **An Interesting and Useful Piece**. I didn't believe the IKEA guy when he said that it could easily hold 33 lbs. It is so lightweight, smooth and pretty, and I had no idea what it was when I saw it on my way to check out, but maybe it could solve the problem of my microwave oven cord being too short to fit any of my electric outlets while placed on any counter or current furniture. Actually, it is built to hold up to 50 lbs. It fit under the end of my breakfast bar near the electric outlet, and my microwave fits neatly on top. The cubbies below can hold items too big for my cupboards. It wipes off nicely.| Arrived Damaged. Recently bought two of these shelve units for my new apartment and was disappointed to find that both of them had been **dented in the exact same spot on** one of the parts. Usually love Ikea furniture, but it looks like these must have been damaged at some point in the factory process which was a little disappointing. Still great just not brand new out of the box which makes **me wonder if quality control has gone** down recently.| UGH!. The only IKEA is nearly forty minutes from me. I bought this item and decided to put it together today. What should’ve taken about ten minutes to assemble with minimal effort ended up taking nearly an hour and an unnecessary amount of work. All because the two side panels are reverse threaded on every side. When tightening the screws, the screws go perfectly into the top and bottom and repel the two inserts. It makes putting the two pieces together nearly impossible. Unfortunately I’m too busy working and gas is too expensive to return this item, especially **since there’s no guarantee whichever piece I** purchase won’t be the same or worse. **Very inconvenient.**"

The cubbies below can hold items too big for my cupboards. It wipes off nicely.| Always a great deal. Kallax units are great storage units in all sizes! We use them in my sewing room, where I have the 5x5, 4x4 and 2x2 units, as well as our garage (where my husband customized some individual units). **They are versatile and the doors** and inserts allow us to tailor the Kallax to our specific needs."

They had the punch mark, but lacked any pre-drilling, which made it impossible to get the screws to **go into the product**. Has to make starting pre-drilled holes enough to get the screw to attach properly.

I love the fact it is raised off the floor and easily moved when needed.| Handy rolling storage. Moderately easy to put together, solid considering the materials, rolls well.

We set ours up vertically. The hardware kit comes with two shelf braces, so the table doesn't rely too heavily on the wood shelf it's mounted on. The bookshelf also comes with wall **anchors which I highly recommend if you** have children using this. It was easy to install. Took a little bit of effort to level the legs. TIP: to start, lay the table face down with legs up and adjust the height of the legs to the shelf that you want to mount to. From there, when you flip it, you can adjust and level. All holes are pre-drilled for you except where the table bracket mounts to the shelf and where the braces will mount under each shelf, but the little screws are pretty well-self tapping. I piloted the first few and then found out I can just put pressure and turn them in manually. This **is WAY WAY sturdier and well built** than then the lame Walmart Better Homes and Garden version that I previously purchased and promptly returned."

80487813,Value,"Cute & Functional. I love my shelf so much. My uncle painted the frame part pink to match my kitchen decor. I use it to free up space on my countertops. I put my little white retro style microwave on it, my pink toaster and pink bubblegum machine filled with chocolates. I also put 2 pans (pink of course) on the bottom shelf. I’m very **pleased with my purchase.**| Easy to put together but flimsy. I ended up returning because I purchased the tall version and needed the short. I’m an IKEA evangelist but I’d say this is **probably twice as expensive as it should** be. It’s easy to put together but seems very flimsy. I didn’t end up buying the shorter one.| Poorly-aligned holes in uprights made for a miserable assembly experience.. You'd think that drilling holes down the center of a strip of wood would be relatively easy for a manufacturer to do well -- but this shelving unit shows that IKEA is not up to the task. The holes in the uprights were sometimes centered and sometimes not, and in one case this required a bit of home woodworking (using far more in the way of tools than came in the boxes) to correct. **If the price were half of** what it is, I might not gripe too much -- but for this price, it's completely inexcusable for IKEA's factory to be so incredibly sloppy. It's also important to note that these shelves look to be solid **slabs in the product photos, but are** actually made of thin sheets of metal wrapped into square tubes at the front and back -- this means that they sag when weight is put anywhere other than the ends, front, or back of the shelves.| EKENABBEN Shelving was perfect. Purchased two and being used in the garage to organize boxed items to pull when needed. Sturdy shelving with enough spacing to keep boxes off the ground. **Great price for our needs.**"
