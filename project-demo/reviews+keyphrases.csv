White Kallax Shelves. These shelves are perfect! I bought the 9 cubbie and the 4 cubbie and put them side by side in my closet. They look so nice and professional. They provide so much extra storage. I will probably buy more for the upstairs closet as well. I hired the Task Rabbit to put them together and that was a great experience.

Finally no MDF!. Finally no MDF!;No MDF - Positive.
Patience with the assembly pays off.. I ordered two of these for my living space. The units are solid and seem durable. However, patience is key in getting these assembled in a way that the vertical supports don't torque themselves into alignments that aren't squared up in the corners. Get all four vertical pieces barely attached, and then go around tightening each corner a few turns at a time under all are fully tightened. It'll take longer this way but you'll be happier with the end result. If you tighten them one by one you'll find that the vertical supports won't square up well, and you'll end up having to undo them all to correct the problem. Slow and steady wins this race.;Solid units - Positive, seem durable - Positive, patience required - neutral, squared up corners - neutral, take longer - neutral, happier with end result - positive, slow and steady - positive.
Very sturdy and sleek. Super easy to assemble, sturdy materials and construction.  I love how thin looking the shelves are: makes all your items really pop out.

Sturdy enough for large books.;Very sturdy - Positive, sleek design - neutral, easy to assemble - positive, thin shelves - Positive, adjustable shelf spacing - Positive, strong enough for large books - Positive.
Minimal & pleasing storage solution. Love this shelf! It allows a lot more light into a dark room, has ample storage, & is very sturdy. It has a clean, classic look that is very minimalist.   It does require two people to build, but with lockdown I had to build it alone. So I used thick books as risers to stabilize the pieces as I was building and it was a huge success — with no bowing or any issues.  Could not be happier with this shelf. If only the smaller version was not discontinued! Wish I had more space so more space so I could get another one.;Minimal & pleasing storage solution - Positive, love this shelf - Positive, allows more light - Positive, ample storage - Positive, sturdy - Positive, clean look - Positive, successful assembly alone - Neutral, wish for smaller version - Neutral, wishes for more space - Neutral.
Cost Cutting Garbage, ignore Older Reviews. I bought one of these guys in 2015 and it went together like a breeze - its still standing after being moved across the state several times. This one I got in 2024 - EVERY shelf piece is hollow with their cardboard honeycomb stuff inside (formerly plywood) and MUCH thinner wall structure on each piece. The shelves flexed so badly it doesn't slot together and leaves huge gaps, plus we knocked a hole into the side panel of it with a soft rubber mallet trying to get it lined up. And yet, Ikea has the gall to charge more for it? Spare me, please.;Breezed together (Old one) - Positive, still standing - Positive, hollow pieces - Negative, cardboard honeycomb - Negative, thinner wall structure - Negative, shelves flexed badly - Negative, huge gaps - Negative, knock damage - Negative, charge more - Negative.

Annoying af. It took me almost 2 hours or more to try to get this to line up or to even get the door on. These are the WORST directions ever.

"It fits perfectly under my windows when placed horizontally. I needed a low bookcase to place under my living room windows to organize books, handwork, and various ""stuff"" in our small apartment to eliminate clutter.  Placed horizontally with no additional frame or legs it fits perfectly.  I have room to display houseplants on the top.   I have four Knipsa storage baskets placed on the bottom four cubby holes which work great and look very nice.    Our furniture is  mostly in traditional wood tones but the white looks clean and bright under the windows which have white plantation shutters and woodwork.  All in all I find this purchase a good value for our purposes, and it was easy to assemble.

"some amateur design, but cheaper than most. Not IKEA's finest assembly procedure or fit+finish, but well priced for the appearance of the final product.  * Super-annoying adhesive on stickers on the frame has to be scrubbed off. No clean peel... * Mis-drilled side piece meant either skipping one set of screws or skipping the stiffening plates (I did the former) * No wall attach kit despite recommendation to attach to wall. Note you'll need less common 2"" screws if you're using anchors. * Poor fit: gaps between shelves and frame. * Wooden shelves don't have pre-drilled holes and the laminate is too tough for the tiny wood screws. You're going to ALSO need a drill to pre-drill (not in instructions).  Looks nice enough when done but twice as annoying as expected. Feels like some designer's first project and he doesn't have his own place so never assembles furniture.  I wouldn't buy another. ";Annoying adhesive - Negative, mis-drilled side piece - Negative, no wall attach kit - Negative, poor fit - Negative.
Worst Ikea product ever. I understand that it is chip so I anticipated some issues with qualities. But assembling the product is a nightmare because it requires some tricks to attach the last wall to complete the shelf. I gave up and carefully used a resin-head hummer to finish the ugly gaps. At the end I smashed it leaving some cracks on the outside. Goes to garbage.;Worst Ikea product - Negative, anticipated issues - Neutral, assembling nightmare - Negative, required tricks - Negative, ugly gaps - Negative, smashed - Negative.

Instructions clearly not written to go together- look at BOTH!!. Love the unit, but I’m extremely irritated that the instructions for the shelving unit say nothing about the underframe requiring four of the larger bolts from the unit to come out so the brackets can be installed. That information is in the instructions for the underframe. I have problems with dexterity and am none too happy about doing the work of getting those bolts in securely just to turn around and have to do it again. Also would have appreciated one of the screwdrivers with 90 degree bends for getting the underframe screws in. Otherwise, lovely storage unit. Tip over hardware is a lot better than the old plastic kits and the wide variety of inserts add more functionality.;Love the unit - Positive, instructions not clear - Negative, requiring removal of larger bolts - Neutral, assembly challenges - Negative, need 90 degree screwdriver - Neutral, tip over hardware - Positive, wide variety of inserts - Positive.
Cute & Functional. I love my shelf so much. My uncle painted the frame part pink to match my kitchen decor. I use it to free up space on my countertops. I put my little white retro style microwave on it, my pink toaster and pink bubblegum machine filled with chocolates. I also put 2 pans (pink of course) on the bottom shelf.

Easy to put together but flimsy. I ended up returning because I purchased the tall version and needed the short. I’m an IKEA evangelist but I’d say this is probably twice as expensive as it should be. It’s easy to put together but seems very flimsy.

So we didn’t have boxes for days!;Easy build - Positive, 45 min assembly - Positive, clear instructions - Positive, minimal packaging - Positive.
Poorly-aligned holes in uprights made for a miserable assembly experience.. You'd think that drilling holes down the center of a strip of wood would be relatively easy for a manufacturer to do well -- but this shelving unit shows that IKEA is not up to the task. The holes in the uprights were sometimes centered and sometimes not, and in one case this required a bit of home woodworking (using far more in the way of tools than came in the boxes) to correct. If the price were half of what it is, I might not gripe too much -- but for this price, it's completely inexcusable for IKEA's factory to be so incredibly sloppy. It's also important to note that these shelves look to be solid slabs in the product photos, but are actually made of thin sheets of metal wrapped into square tubes at the front and back -- this means that they sag when weight is put anywhere other than the ends, front, or back of the shelves.;Miserable assembly experience - negative, poorly-aligned holes - negative, home woodworking required - neutral, thin metal shelves - neutral, IKEA not up to task - negative.

Love this!. I love the quality of this. It was relatively easy to assemble and it’s solid. Great value and definitely recommend. The only thing that I might like to see would be an option for a back to enclose the compartments to use as a cubby system instead of shelves.

Beautiful. This might be my favorite piece in my office. I’ve used the bottom cubes for storage bins, the top cubes for display cases, and the top shelf for books and plants.

A Staple!. I got 2 of these shelves and adore them. They're stable, sturdy, and easy to put together by yourself. I would also imagine they're easy to paint over for a different look. I would buy another!  One tip for assembly is to just lightly hand screw everything in before tightening them all the way in the final step! Otherwise, sometimes the holes don't align properly :);Adore shelves - Positive, Stable - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, Easy to put together - Positive, Easy to paint over - Neutral, Lightly hand screw - Neutral, Buy another - Positive, Align properly tip - Neutral.
Cute but not easy!. These cubes are very cute and practical but the fact that Ikea sells them as easy to assemble baffles the mind. I have done several of these at this point and there hasn't been a single one that hasn't required some light hammering (which risks ruining the board) or basically me just accepting that one of the sides will be slightly off-kilter. Every single product I have bought from Ikea that required actual tools to assemble (including a kitchen cabinet!) has been easier to assemble in comparison/proportionately speaking. Like I said, they are cute though, and a practical solution for some awkward storage needs around the house, so it's a good bang for the buck as long as you take the video on the website with a grain of salt.;Cute design - Positive, not easy to assemble - Negative, practical - Positive, slight assembly discrepancies - Negative, good value for the price - Positive.

Baggebo shelf. My teen loves this shelf! We have had Kallax for storage in his room a long time, but he has been asking for shelving to display smaller items.

Perfect for vinyl record storage. Must mount it though. This is perfect for my album collection. I used metal wall anchors from the hardware store to mount all four corners to the wall. I have about 900 vinyl albums and this holds them perfectly. As always follow the directions. Assembling on a carpet using a level are important. I also added wood glue to all the dowels so they stay solid. ;Vinyl record storage - Positive, must be mounted - Neutural, holds 900 albums - Positive, adds wooden glue for stability - Positive.

Doesn’t fit the kallax shelf. I purchased it thinking it would fit in the shelf like the reviews and description said but it don’t. It too big for the shelf space and annoying trying to fit. Easy to put together but useless because I can’t fit it in the shelf just sitting in my home collecting dust;Doesn't fit in shelf - Negative, Easy to put together - Positive, collects dust - Negative.
Huge Disappointment!!! Doesn't fit- too large!!. Very disappointed with these - they don't fit.  I picked these up with some other items in Renton yesterday - a 110 mile drive from me. Got home with them and they don't fit - they are too large to insert into the cubicle.  I have 2 different Kallax units - one is a 20 cubicle unit, the other an 8 cubicle unit - these will not fit into any cubicle in either of the units!!!  According to the sticker on these inserts they were manufactured (?) in Poland 2021-11-08. I saw another reviewer say that theirs were too big too. What happened to quality control??? I don't make a drive that far on a regular basis so, I'm stuck with the useless things since I won't pay shipping to return them.  Shouldn't have happened - very disappointed.;Doesn't fit - Negative, too large - Negative, disappointed - Negative, not manufactured to specification - Neutral, quality control issue - Negative.
Great Product, But Disappointed. This shelving unit is absolutely beautiful and did not seem difficult to assemble - I hired a worker from Task Rabbit so I don't know for sure. However, I was so disappointed to find out that this particular item is just two units, one double width and a single width, put very close together. It is not one big unit. With so many combinations you can make from these units, I have no idea why this is the only one that is sold together, it's very misleading. I also had mine delivered so didn't realize until I had them in my home. I decided to return the single width unit and buy another double width one.;Absolutely beautiful - Positive, difficult assembly unclear - Neutral, two connected units - Negative, misleading description - Negative.

Love the low profile. I wouldn't have thought from the description that these metal shelves would have such a low profile, but after seeing them at a friends house I was sold.

Wonderful storage. This is a wonderful piece of furniture for any sewing studio or craft room.   I use my Kallax units for storing fabrics wrapped around comic book boards.

Perfection. I waited MONTHS for Vittsjo to come back in stock, and I am so glad I didn't give up and purchase something elsewhere. To get a similar look elsewhere will cost ~$300. This shelf unit is GORGEOUS – modern, clean lines, simple, well-constructed, sturdy. I do wish the holes in the top and bottom wood slabs were pre-drilled, but it wasn't too difficult to do it ourselves. We also didn't receive enough padding stickers for the glass, so we improvised. I can't say enough good things about this unit otherwise.;Months-long waiting - Negative, Gorgeous design - Positive, modern - Positive, clean lines - Positive, simple - Positive, well-constructed - Positive, sturdy - Positive, improvised solution for padding - Neutral.

Great but.... The shelf is great. Bought it to use for bathroom storage and it fits perfectly. I took off one star because it was way to hard to assemble.

Glossy and great. The glossy white Kallax is one of those IKEA pieces that is such a great price point for how modern it feels. The 4 square version was easy to put together solo. And I paired it next to a larger one I bought years ago. This is a great extension that was in budget and looks seamless.

Love it!. Clean lines, great configuration for my purposes;Clean lines - Positive, great configuration - Positive.
The Best for my Craft Room. I put this off for years but finally with an update of flooring was forced to organize my craft room.  I chose the Kallex to be the main form of storage and love the pieces I bought!  the 16 unit wall shelving piece plus the pieces to divide several of the areas for paper, and other supplies are perfect.  It was much quicker to install than I expected and now only after a couple of days, I realize how silly my procrastination actually was.  I should have done this years ago!!!  ;Organized craft room - Positive, chose Kallex - Positive, 16 unit wall shelving - Positive, divided areas - Positive, quick installation - Positive, procrastination regret -Negative.

The best options. I was looking for something nice and elegant for my spa 🧖🏼‍♀️ and it really is how I wanted it;Nice and elegant - Positive, met expectations - Positive.
NOT difficult to assemble!. Lots of reviews saying these are difficult to assemble. They are not. You just have to follow the instruction of leaving the panel labelled “1” on the bottom throughout the entire assembly. The groove in panel one is significantly deeper than the grooves in the other panels. This allows the piece that slides in the back to sit lower so that you’re able to pop in the last panel without any resistance. Again, just leave the panel labeled “1” on the floor (or table if you’re assembling on a table surface) and you should be fine.  **I did struggle until I realized my mistake. Once I figured out that I wasn’t following the instructions properly, these cubes assembled in about a minute and a half. ;Not difficult to assemble - Positive, instructions important - Neutral, assembled in minute and a half - Positive.

Don’t give up like I almost did!!!. Writing this review to help people who had trouble like me. I spent over an hour trying to align the pieces to fit, I even searched for tutorials on YouTube, and couldn’t find one for this specific model. Was very frustrated and was about to send all 4 of my Eket back to where they come from.   I took them apart and I realized the fault is not the product, it’s in the instructions. All the side boards should be numbered from 1-4, not just the first board. Essentially you would connect number one first with the sides and the pieces inside, and at the VERY END, the last piece should be the board opposite from number 1. If your last piece is the ones on the side of number 1, you will never get it to align. It took me less than 5 minutes to finish each one doing it this way, which is to follow the pictures to a tee. But Ikea should modify the instructions to be more specific and fool proof and number each side boards.   It looks beautiful and perfectly aligned when done!;Alignment issue - Negative, flawed instructions - Negative, frustration - Negative, sturdy - Positive, numbered sides - Neutral, beautiful alignment - Positive.
"Good size for my needs. Easy to assemble!!!. I bought two white Ekets 2 x 2 as the size was good for my needs. When I was reading the reviews, I was in a doubt if I can assemble it myself properly.

Great product. These drawers are much nicer than expected.  They went together relatively easy and having the metal bearing slides make them very smooth in operation.

"Putting together was a pain. Its so difficult to put together for something that's just supposed to ""snap together"". the plastic attachment grooves on the sides don't work nor fit together perfectly so a part of the sides don't lay flat with each other. Had to literally use a rubber mallet to force things to fit better. And even then they didn't line up correctly.

My new favorite IKEA furniture. This thing is great!  It's super easy to put together, and thanks to the various inserts it's also a very versatile piece of shelving.

It serves a purpose. It serves a purpose for storage, but i think the materials are too cheap. When we were putting together our KALLAX cubes, it didn’t line up perfectly despite our careful attention to building instructions. Now the shelves don’t shut correctly and it bothers me for the price and time spent trying to build it. There’s just something not right about the way the material looks and feels.

"Terrible quality. I have an older Kallax shelf with several drawer units. The drawer enclosures are made from actual wood. These pieces of garbage barely qualify as cardboard. They are flimsy and arrived RIPPED. And i now realize I am writing a review using the word ""ripped"" when describing a drawer enclosure.";Flimsy drawer enclosures - Negative, arrived ripped - Negative, terrible quality - Negative.
Hacked the Use. Instead of purchasing a closet system, I used two of the Kallax units to rework a walk in closet. Standing, this particular configuration fits under the existing hanging clothes rack. I place a second Kallax on the other wall in a horizontal position. I can now hang cloths, neatly arrange folded sweaters and jeans, and have more room than ever before.;Reworked walk-in closet - Positive, fits under clothes rack - Positive, more room than ever - Positive, horizontal configuration - Neutral.
Cheaply made, Flimsy. These used to be made much better. They are terrible now. I wrote another review under the inserts with the doors that goes into more detail, but essentially, these used to be decent, but now they are little more than cardboard, with a laminated particleboard front. Very disappointing.;Cheaply made - Negative, flimsy - Negative, used to be better - Negative, particleboard front - Neutral.
So disappointing!. We bought this newer version of the Kallax, after having owned the older version (c. 90s-2000s.) This was very, very disappointing. Extremely cheaply made. Would never hold up to continued regular use. We were expecting the same quality we used to get from Ikea products.

I had the old ones that were made of solid materia.. This new design is awful unfortunately. It’s flimsy, and requires you to make holes and damage the bookcase. Wish I could return it. Disappointing;Flimsy design - Negative, requires damage to bookcase - Negative.
Frame needs to be attached to unit. So disappointed in this--you just set the shelving unit on top of the underframe, which means it just wobbles around.  There needs to be a way to attach the frame to the shelving. ;Frame not attached - Negative, wobbles around - Negative.
Unbelievably Cheap. I know IKEA is the place to buy affordable furniture. We purchased one of these for our young daughter years ago (maybe 2015 or 2016), and it has held up to her, her friends, and one across the country. We just bought another one for a closet, but this time, the quality is significantly lesser. I don't know if the shelves are made of foam, or what, but they are so light that they float/glide across each other when stacking. I'd estimate that each shelf weighs less than a ream of paper. We're desperate and we live far away from an IKEA so we'll keep it, but honestly, it is just so cheap I don't know if I'll go back for the 4 shelf Kallax that is delayed due to quality issues (according to the salesperson). This can't possibly be good for the environment.;Unbelievably cheap - neutral, held up years ago - Positive, significantly lesser quality - Negative, estimated weight of each shelf - Negative, desperate - Neutral.
Impossible to assemble. This would have been a nifty little shelf if only one could assemble it. Holes of uneven size and not deep enough for screws or dowels to fit or be tightened properly. The pieces that I put together kept falling apart so it was impossible to build because one couldn't get the frame to stay put long enough to attach the shelves.;Impossible to assemble - Negative, uneven size holes - Negative, not deep enough for screws - Negative.
Tight fit, but great for shoes. I knocked off a star due to how difficult it was to get them inserted into an already built Kallax unit. I would recommend inserting at time of Kallax build, before final tightening of all the bolts. That said, they are great for dividing the squares on the Kallax. I have a 4x4 square unit in my closet and installed four of these along the bottom row. It allows me to neatly store 4 pairs of shoes in each Kallax square.;Tight fit - neutral, great for shoes - Positive, difficult to install - Negative, divide Kallax squares - Positive.
Hobby Supplies Storage. It’s not easy finding storage that is deep enough for my 12x 12 scrapbook paper. Kallax fits it perfectly! And the various inserts make each cube customizable for other items I need to store for my hobbies.;Deep shelves - Positive, fits 12x12 paper - Positive, customizable inserts - Positive.
Just what I was looking for!. I love my Kallax layered shelves. They fit perfectly in my shelving unit. They were so easy to put together without any tools.

Great slots. This worked really well for the purpose I had. Plenty sturdy enough for folders, little piles of papers and such.;Plenty sturdy - Positive, worked well - Positive.
Kallax. So sad not to have my Expedit as an option. These are ok but the others were far superior (I had them over a decade and 3 major moves). My recommendation is based sadly on the fact that there is no longer the previous version. The base is a good option to have however it is waaay too tall.;Preferred previous version - Negative, Base is a good option - Neutral, Base is too tall - Negative.

Easy Assembly / Great for Vinyl or Other Shelving. Didn't take me long to put these together (I ordered two for giving myself room to expand my ever-growing vinyl collection). Very little tools needed for assembling, and it's great for why I need it.

Elegant steel shelves. I bought a set of these 10 years ago and just bought another. You can't tell them apart, they have held up so well. For steel shelves, they are very elegant and suitable for a living room or anywhere. The wide drawers work well, but due to the width you don't want to put anything too heavy in them.;Set of steel shelves - Positive, held up well for 10 years - Positive, elegant design - Positive, wide drawers work well - Neutral, not suitable for heavy items - Neutral.
Turns small spaces into dense storage. This is perfect for small areas between other things, what might otherwise be wasted space becomes 4 spacious cubes for clothes, toys, whatever. Also helps with de-cluttering because a cube can contain the sort of things like alarm clocks or a jewelry box that you would normally think has to take up valuable space on top of a bedside table or dresser.;Small spaces solution - Positive, turns wasted space into storage - Positive, de-clutters - Positive, spacious cubes - Positive.
Kallax forever. Of course Kallax is the best deal on the planet for storing vinyl LPs, but it can do so much more. Having 4x4 or 5x5 cubes to work with is liberating, and enables you to put things that go together in the same cube, instead of having to find wherever something will fit (where you'll never find it).;Best deal on the planet - Positive, stores vinyl LPs - Positive, liberating - Positive, enables organization - Positive, 4x4 or 5x5 cubes - Positive.

Almost 5 ⭐️. Solid build. I like the unit but received one of the frame rusty. Tried some elbow grease and some solution with no luck, so I had that portion facing to the wall. I read almost all the reviews before buying, didn’t expect that I would come across with the same issue with other reviewers. Still a good unit.;Solid build - Positive, Received rusty frame - Negative.
Ruined my life. I’ve never experienced such frustration in my life. We had four people trying to put this together in turns for over 4 hours and still could not do it. It is the bane of my existence. The amount of agony and trauma I have gone through is unparalleled. I’ve bought previous IKEA furniture and I’ve never had this issue before. Please, for everyone’s sanity, don’t buy this. Even when finished there’s no sense of accomplishment, just more pain. We spent so long, agonized every step of the way, and for what? This piece of junk? It doesn’t even look that good.

Use it as a bench for the mudroom. It fits perfectly with the DIY mudroom project. ;Perfect fit - Positive, DIY mudroom project - Neutral.
Base does not actually attach to Kallax unit. Looks great with the raised base, but Ikea should really note in the product information that the base does not attach to the Kallax unit, so you have to anchor to the wall.  It would still be nice to attach the base to the storage unit somehow.;Base does not attach - Negative, looks great - Positive, should note in product info - Negative.
Good quality, fair price. It's a good quality shelf- second time buying one.;Good quality - Positive, fair price - Positive, second time buying - Neutral.
Easy assembly and fit perfectly. Purchased this shelf unit to fit within a small space and after the easy assembly it fit into that space like it was made for it.    Only criticism on assembly is for alignment of the pieces.  They did okay on the overall design, but it would work even better if you simply used screws that had a bit of an alignment collar.  Similar to a lug bolt on a car is used to help align the wheel to the hub.  These completely flat based screws makes you have to leave them all a little loose until all pieces are in place and then you can tighten and align as you go.  Not too difficult but still not as simple as it could be.;Easy assembly - Positive, fits perfectly - Positive, small space - Neutral, criticism on alignment - Negative.
Look nice but they sag under load. I have several of these under some 4x2 and 4x4 Kallax shelves. They add a nice look by raising the shelves up off the floor. However, for being made of steel, they do sag a bit causing the entire shelf to sag a bit. It’s disappointing. There should be a set of legs at the midpoint to help support things. I’m going to have to find a way to add support.;Look nice - Positive, made of steel - Neutral, sag under load - Negative, add support needed - Negative.
Best shelf for house plants!!. Great shelf for house plants ;Best shelf for house plants - Positive, Great shelf - Neutral.
Great piece, a bit wobbly. I’ve waited to be close enough to make an IKEA trip for this piece. I love how modern it looks and it was relatively easy to put together. Once assembled, it seems like it could use another set of the triangle braces that are provided for the first glass shelf on the bottom. I know it would mess with the aesthetic a bit, but I’m thinking about how I could brace it on my own.  It did NOT come with any wall hardware or pieces to attach to the wall. Since it sits out a bit with a baseboard, it would take a very long screw to get to the wall. I was expecting the plastic “zip tie” type anchors to be included.;Modern design - Positive, Relatively easy to put together - Positive, Needs additional bracing - Neutral, missing wall hardware - Negative.
Fine small shelf unit. Well built, easy to assemble, attractive.  The large shelf spaces are functional for books of assorted sizes.;Well built - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, attractive - Positive, functional for books of varied sizes - Positive.
Love the modularity. I love the look of the shelf unit, assembly was very easy, and the idea of modules which are drawers, cabinets, or baskets is pure genius. Unfortunately it is not very stable and I suspect that it will need bracing before too long for it not to collapse.;Modularity - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, drawers, cabinets, baskets - Positive, unstable - Negative.
Super wobbly??. I just bought 2 of the 5x5 units and had them assembled by TaskRabbit... and they are VERY wobbly. This is a huge surprise as we had several of the older model and they were sturdy as rocks. Not sure if they were poorly assembled this time or if this is due to the newer model? Anyone else have this issue?;Very wobbly units - Negative, assembled by TaskRabbit - Neutral, surprise - Negative, older model was sturdy - Positive.
No screws to bolt to wall. For a shelving unit that depends on being bolted to the wall per IKEA’s instructions, they didn’t actually provide the screws needed to do it, nor do the instructions tell you at the beginning that you need said screw before you begin. We have a two-year-old, and so we panic-searched our house for something to bolt the shelf with before we had to pick him up from daycare. All the instructions had was a dotted outline of the screw with an absent product number (which all the included parts had throughout the pictures) to show you it wasn’t included in the materials provided, and that info only showed up at the back of the instruction book in the steps for bolting it to the wall. There was no notice at the beginning saying to be sure to buy the screws so you could ensure you had all materials before building the shelf. Frustrating as a parent, to say the least!;No screws provided - Negative, Instructions did not mention missing screws - Neutral, Hinders safety - Negative.
Some disadvantages compared to Expedit. So, it should go without saying that this is an iconic shelving unit and I'm glad to have it. That said, you asked for a review and the honest answer is: I'm quite disappointed. I had a 5 x 5 Expedit shelf unit and I expected Kallax to be very similar. First, after renting a truck to move the boxes, I discovered (in store) that the 5x5 Kallax unit has been sold out for months and that it was unlikely to be back in stock soon, in any color. I ended up opting to buy a 4x4 plus a 2x4 to make the room divider I needed. This is somewhat less than optimal because the Kallax has a wider edge than internal part. Another disadvantage of the Kallax units is that they have exposed hardware on the top of the unit, and drilled holes inside the sides of the shelves that are visible if you don't use the wall mounting hardware (which I don't, because I'm using the shelves as a room divider). Both of these features make the Kallax look less polished than the Expedit. Finally, I'm very disappointed that the door units must be drilled into the Kallax. I loved the Expedit door inserts in part because I could easily take them out and transfer them to a different block to change up the look. Now the units can't be moved, and they are much trickier to assemble. All in all, after having an Expedit, Kallax seems like more of a hassle, less polished, and less flexible.;Iconic shelving unit - Positive, honest answer - Neutral, 5x5 Kallax unit unavailable - Neutral, wider edge - Neutival, exposed hardware on top - Negative, drilled holes visible - Negative, doors must be drilled in - Negative.

Wrong size!. I realize it must be difficult to actually write on a website that a product is incompatible with another product, but Ikea has accomplished this. Neither the short or long leg sets I bought work with either of my Kallax units. Terrible. Buyer beware.;Incompatible with Kallax units - Negative.
Basic shelf. Some wobbliness, and the metal oddly enough is not as thick as my older versions!;Basic shelf - neutral, Some wobbliness - negative, Metal thickness less than expected - negative.
Lovely Shelves to Display Plants. Shelves in front of 8' windows to display orchids and violets. Glass shelves allow light to lower levels. Overall, beautiful, easy to assemble except for one screw that was stripped upon arrival and was useless.

Good bookcase. A little rockie. Not very sturdy. But great amount of storage.;Average bookcase - neutral, not very sturdy - negative, great storage - positive.
Great except…. Got for my sewing room to store fabric and it works great except it doesn’t line up evenly with the studs in an American home, nor does it line up with the height of our electric sockets, so it is hard to plug in stuff. But it was easy to assemble and it stores the fabric well ;Stores fabric well - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, lines up unevenly - Negative, doesn't line up with studs - Negative, doesn't line up with electric sockets - Negative, difficult to plug in - Negative.
Perfect in our guest room.. Perfect in our guest room. Looks great and holds lots of books;Great in guest room - Positive, holds a lot of books - Positive.
Nice style. We've had this one for nearly a month, and it's definitely a good style. I wouldn't mind seeing an option for rectangular tall shelves for a larger display area. A couple inches wider on each shelf would've been perfect. However, it's sturdy and stylish and works well all together.;Good style - Positive, sturdy - Positive, works well - Positive, wider shelves desired - Neutral.
Great storage for vinyl. I was looking for something to display my vinyls and some statues/figures at the same time and these were a Great Wall mountable option.;Wall mountable - Positive, great storage - Positive, for vinyl - Positive.
Awful!. I bought two of this thing, bc i had an od version of the same thing that I liked a lot, a kallax i think it was. Thought this was the same thing, but its completely different and MUCH worse. Harder to put together, doesnt actually connect with thing that looks like a longer bookshelf. Just a massive downgrade.;Bought 2 - Neutral, harder to put together - Negative, doesn't connect - Negative.
Complete frustration . We bought 2 of  the eket cubbies to make a longer bookshelf. I loved the sleek look online and thought it would be a great addition to our home. We opened up the first box and started putting it together. It was much more difficult to figure out how to get it today because the directions absolutely suck. But, we finally figured it out. But to our dismay, one of the shelving holes were drilled too close together. We took the whole thing apart thinking that we messed something up, but we ended up right with the same problem. So we opened the next box and started putting it together only to have the exact same problem. Two with the exact same problem? I questioned my husband again if we screwed something up. He is convinced it’s a factory issue so back to ikea they go.  ;Sleek look - Neutral, complete frustration - Negative, difficult to assemble - Negative, directions are bad - Negative, drilled holes issue - Negative.

Great window seat/book shelf. The product was very easy to assemble. Holds a generous amount of books.;Easy to assemble - Positive, holds a generous amount of books - Positive.
I couldn't imagine a poor quality shelf. I bought these shelves based on the many postitive reviews. I couldn't have been more dissappointed. The entire structural integrety is on small wooden dowels. The shelves do not support themselves, let alone put anything on them.  Based on this product alone, Sweeden should not be allowed into NATO.;Dissappointed with purchase - Negative, many positive reviews - Neutral, poor quality - Negative, small wooden dowels - Negative, does not support itself - Negative.
Cardboard inside the walls! Not solid particle board.. Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it. Ours got weaker and started to wobble, so I wanted to lay it down on its face to add metal braces to the back corners, and the thing just ripped apart under its own weight. I am glad it did because I can see now that the outer edge pieces are thin strips of MDF with cardboard filler! I can't believe they can sell this as a safe product.;Cardboard inside walls - Negative, bookshelf weakened over time - Negative, started to wobble - Neutral, thin MDF edge pieces - Negative.
Misaligned. Edge dowels won't go in all the way so the whole alignment is nearly a half inch off. If I hammer them in any harder the wood will bust.;Edge dowels - Neutral, Misaligned - Negative.
Dowels do not fit into shelves. I've put together several of the smaller Kallax shelves over the year with no problem. Unfortunately, with this unit the dowels are too large and do not fit in the shelves. I called to complain after ruining a couple of the shelves and dowels, was sent a new one and had the same problem. I had to redrill all the holes so the dowels would fit - very time consuming for what should be an easy assembly. Noticed this complaint in other reviews and should have paid attention.;Dowels do not fit in shelves - Negative, time consuming assembly - Negative.
A huge bummer. Nearly finished building it when one of the screws simply would not screw in so tried to turn it to try a different angle, and a bunch of the connecting wood pieces snapped and lodged inside the shelves, impossible to get out. So can't finish putting it together and wasted the $270. Just terrible.;Impossible to finish assembly - Negative, connecting pieces snapped - Negative, wasted money - Negative.

Nice product!. My daughter’s preferred clothing organization method is “put everything in laundry baskets.“ She needed a unit to stack her laundry baskets, this works perfectly for that!;Stack laundry baskets - Positive, preferred organization method - neutral, works perfectly - Positive.
The quality of wood is horrible.. The price wasn't worth it. The wood quality was not good. I had to sand and varnish because the surface of the wood was too sharp and had a lot of splinters. After assembly, the balance was not right.;Horrible wood quality - Negative, not worth the price - Negative, had to sand and varnish - Negative, assembly balance not right - Negative.
Good, but ... Solid sturdy shelf, but why not include some hardware covers like most other brands?  It decreases the quality appearance to have silver hardware showing. Not that hard to assemble but it would go much faster if Ikea used a little extra ink on the instructions to mark the boards. ;Solid sturdy shelf - Positive, Decreases appearance with silver hardware showing - Negative, Not hard to assemble - Neutral, Instructions need more ink - Neutral.
Defective batch. After finishing the assembly, the doors were not aligned at the same level. I returned the product and ordered a replacement, but unfortunately, encountered the same issue once again;Defective batch - negative, doors not aligned - negative.

Not too hard to put together.;Nice look - Positive, compliments office furniture - Positive, versatile - Positive, added inserts - neutral, not hard to assemble - Positive.
Built an entire wall of shelving!. We used 6 units and three bases and constructed an entire wall of shelving. We used heavy duty threaded c-clamps to securely connect each pair of units together and to connect the resulting “stacks” together.   To save assembly time we used TaskRabbit to do the assembly. Well worth the $188 dollars. The Tasker did in two hours what would have taken us 6 hours.;Built entire wall - Neutral, sturdy units - Positive, heavy duty clamps - Positive, time-saving - Positive.
Looks good. Looks good;Looks good - Positive.
Not worth it. I have been buying Kallax shelf since they first opened their store’s in Germany. So, many years. I used them in the garage, kids room and living room. The little cubbies are very useful and versatile. Over the years I noticed the shelf getting smaller and smaller. But now it’s enough. I will not buy them again. I will return these after coming back from my vacation. They are so not worth the money. Instructions are easy to follow and Putting them together was easy except that some of the dowels would just break off so easily, they feel like big toothpicks. I was not able to pull the broken ones out. They would just crumple as soon as my pliers touched them.  The entire shelf is so very light, it feels like I am using thick cardboard to assemble it. If you have children or pets you will definitely have to mount it to the wall.  As a consumer, at some point I have to say this is just cheap s… once put together forget about taking it apart….;Used for years - neutral, little cubbies - Positive, versatile - Positive, getting smaller - Negative, not worth the money - Negative, easy to follow instructions - neutral, putting together easy with broken dowels - Negative, feels light and not sturdy - Negative, have to mount to the wall - Negative.
Impossible to assemble. I’ve assembled many IKEA pieces of furniture in my life and this is by far the worst. The holes drilled were not deep enough for parts to fit together and we literally had to deepen them with a drill in order to assemble the bookcase. Usually a little banging with a hammer here and there solves the issue but the holes on the sides were about 3/8” short so no amount of hammering helped (and trust me we were so pissed we used quite a bit of force). I would have returned if it wasn’t such a hassle to bring everything back when I had to borrow a car from a friend and drive 30 miles to get this in the first place.;Impossible to assemble - Negative, holes drilled not deep enough - Negative, required drill to assemble - Negative, assembly process frustrating - Negative.
Quality & Aesthetic, Tricky Assembly. The unit itself now that it’s built is great, but there are so many components that look identical yet are actually every so slightly different that are easily mistaken for the correct piece, which leads to a lot of building, disassembling, and rebuilding;Quality unit - Positive, Aesthetic - Positive, Tricky assembly - Negative.
Very modern . This is such a clean and efficient storage module.  I only wish the cardboard boxes they make fit the cubes better.  (I also liked the metal trim and lable holders on the old cardboard boxes.  Fabric is good, but the sleek coated cardboard in various colors was nice as well.  Not find if the matt paper ones) Still, this is a great piece for so many things. I seem to remember it wasn’t as heavy many years ago.  The heaviness of the furniture isn’t good. ;Modern design - Positive, clean and efficient - Positive, cardboard boxes don't fit well - Neutive, like old cardboard boxes - Neutral, fabric material - Neutral, heaviness - Negative.
Cute unit. I purchased to set up as a coffee area station in my pantry to save working counter space. Works well. Typical Ikea set up but once we figured out the layout, switching the middle vertical post to the correct side, it was fine. Level was good. Just missing the magnet to hold a door shut and they are out of stock on the missing parts page of true website, so not sure how I will fix that.;Cute unit - Positive, works well - Positive, typical Ikea setup - Neutral, level - positive, missing magnet - negative.
Great Piece!. This works so well in my space. I bought with the intention of using it in my office, but it is versatile so might move it around to change things up in other rooms.

Looks great but starting to sag . I love how this base elevates the Kallax, but unfortunately, after about a year I can see the top shelf is starting to detach caused by sagging in the middle. I thought this would be strong given it’s constructed of metal. It really needs a center leg to properly distribute the weight.  ;Elevates Kallax - Positive, sagging - Negative, middle detaches - Negative, constructed of metal - Neutral, needs center leg - Negative.
Love it. This gold shelf-within-a-shelf is perfect for board books to fit more on the shelf, or anything else that isn’t tall enough to use the whole cubby, but you want to use some of that open space above.

the parts are different. I have 4 Kallax of various sizes in my house. I've never had a hard time building one before. I'm not sure what is different, maybe the wooden dowels are longer than they used to be or the holes are not as well made. This was the smallest one I've put together and it was such a pain. The dowels simply wouldn't go into the holes smoothly, even with all my weight (not inconsiderable) pushing in. I ended up using a rubber mallet that almost worked but dented the sides. I'm very disappointed.;Different parts - neutral, not hard to build - Positive, larger Kallax units - neutral, this one was painful - negative, dowels didn't fit smoothly - negative, used rubber mallet - neutral, disappointed - negative.

Perfect display shelving. I bought this to display my LEGO CONSTRACTION Star Wars figures. I needed something that was the right spacing and would also allow light to get through.

So very nice. I wanted bookcase that were a bit more “upscale” than the very affordable Billy bookcases. I was so happy with the Havasta! Very sturdy- high quality.

Good Looks, BUT Tough Assembly. I have now assembled 8 shelf units and have found that in every unit there are at least 3 mis-alligned screw holes.

Surprisingly Poor Construction. This is the first IKEA product series I have been sorely disappointed with. We have bought quite a few products from IKEA: desks, outdoor furniture, a bed, chairs, a dining room table, and quite a few others.  In most cases, the tolerances are quite good, and things fit tightly, so long as you follow the directions.   For both KALLAX shelves I bought, the problem is the dowels: following the directions, using a hammer, I inexplicably damaged both shelves because the dowels didn’t quite fit.  I do not recommend this at all. I am not returning it, due to the distance to the store.

Kallax 4 cubby. I prefer to get the smaller 2-4 cube shelf units a they’re much easier to move around or if you’re having a manic moment in the middle of the night and want to rearrange the entire room. It’s far better to move smaller shelves than the larger 8+ units. … was it worth the price? Mmm I’m pretty sure these used to be around 30ish bucks but now they’re back up to 40 to 60 rounded up. I’d appreciate if they were 34 dollars  and wouldn’t spike up in cost more than 5 bucks.

Great for LP storage. I bought a few of these in the 8-cube configuration a long time ago to store vinyl records and loved them. I heard that IKEA discontinued them years ago and recently found out that they started making them again. The new edition is not quite as sturdy as the originals but are still very good. The outside frame is a little more narrow and the whole unit is slightly lighter, but the old ones were probably heavier than they needed to be so this shouldn't be a big deal.

Glossy finish off-putting. I love the shape, design. But the mounting is not functional. The security brackets are not spaced for both to hit studs, so the expectation is that one would be in a stud and one in an anchor. I decided to wall-mount mine, so I placed brackets on the bottom. It looks great on the wall. And finally, the finish is glossy, almost glassy, which clashes a little with my eggshell walls.

Great storage addition to my sewing room!. I bought this little shelf for my sewing room to provide more storage as well as provide an ironing surface. With this shelf being at counter height, I can easily add a do-it-yourself ironing board to the top! (plywood+batting+pretty fabric) This will make this piece even more versatile, which is great! My husband put it together for me and was surprised it just snapped together. He did come across one broken piece that he had to go exchange at our local IKEA, but out of all the items we have purchased, this has been the only instance of that happening. I actually do not have this one attached to the wall at the moment, but it seems sturdy and holds a lot.

NOT fit old Kallax shelf unit!!. I have two Kallax shelf units of the same size, measuring 30 3/8 by 57 7/8 inches, which I bought at different times. One is high gloss white, and the other one is regular white. The base legs can only be installed with the white unit, which I purchased about two years after the gloss white one. The part number 10081882/10081773, which is designed to connect the Kallax unit to the legs, is shorter and cannot reach the holes on the old high gloss Kallax unit. but the product detail information here mentioned it fit all KALLAX unit. which is not true!;Fits old Kallax unit - Negative, base legs - Neutral, product details - Negative.
Great Office Addition. I use Kallax on its side to create an L-shaped desk in my new office. It has worked great. Was very easy and quick to assemble.;L-shaped desk - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, Great office addition - Positive.
Perfect for NEWER Kallax Shelving. I love the way this elevates the look of these shelves (and literally lifts them off the floor, so they’re less dusty).   Be careful! If you have Kallax shelves that were purchased several years back. IKEA changed the design several years ago, and the outer dimensions are about an inch off. Mine are slightly bigger than the current Kallax shelves, so these legs don’t actually mount properly. I was able to screw them into my slightly larger version and use them.;Elevates look of shelves - Positive, less dusty - Positive, slightly bigger than current IKEA Kallax - Neutral, mounts slightly differently - Neutral.

Old style was better. While the doors are functional and look good I gave 2 stars because the quality has certainly declined. Walls are now made of cardboard rather than the sturdy construction of previous models. Difficult to install due to screws tearing cardboard walls before ever making it flush onto the kallax cube wall.;Functional doors - Neutral, Decline in quality - Negative, made of cardboard - Negative, Difficult to install - Negative.
Was not what I thought it would be. Once assembled it get rather flimsy for books. Better off getting a billy bookcase or similar for heavy objects.

Nice for the price. I decided to organize and create a smaller footprint for the toys the grandkids play with when they come over. This works great. The 13 by 13 cubes are very spacious.

Excellent value for this product family!. I like this size for kids toys and end tables.  I can put one of these together in about 20 minutes taking my time.  I am a Kallax fan.  We have purchased many sizes with various inserts over the years, and we have never been disappointed.  I think my favorite is the black brown with doors and drawers.  My kids prefer the lighter color units with colored inserts (especially the green metal doors offered several years ago.)  The lighter colors don't require as many touchups over the years, but touching up scratches isn't difficult if you're crafty. We have used permanent marker and paint to good effect.  If your product is damaged or missing parts when you get home, IKEA will make it right.  They have even mailed parts to my house.  Reach out to customer service and see what your options are.;Excellent value - Positive, liked size for kids toys and end tables - neutral, easy assembly - Positive, Kallax fan - Positive, favorite black brown with doors and drawers - Positive, good customer service experience - Positive.

Really Tough to Assemble . Shelf looks great and functions well after it's put together but it was really difficult to assemble by myself. The wood shelf's are not predrilled so you have to apply a ton of pressure to get the screws in. I ended up using Bungie cords to hold the shelf in place while I added the screws. This would've been easier if I had clamps or a second person applying pressure.;Really tough to assemble - Negative,Functions well - Positive, Looks great - Positive, Wood shelves are not predrilled - Negative.

"Perfect find. I was looking for a shelf of some sort for my printer/extra office supplies. The Billy bookcases were much too narrow and the Kallax were too chunky for the space I needed it in. This cart is the perfect compromise! The Pudda baskets fit perfectly in the square compartments, and I’ve got spare paper, notebooks, etc on the shelves. The quality was also surprising; I’m used to most Ikea furniture coming with a super thin board you nail in to the back, but the back of this is sturdy and could certainly be exposed in the room. Thanks for this piece, Ikea! Hopefully there will be a broader color range in the future.";Perfect compromise find - Positive, suitable size - Positive, sturdy back - Positive, surprising quality - Positive, Ikea - Positive, wish for broader color range - Neutral.

Also good as a TV Stand if you don't want to put your TV at a too low position. I bought this as my TV Stand, because I don't want to put the TV at a too low position. It works well. The depth of the frame can hold a 55 inch Samsung S95B and a Bose S700 soundbar (it is not too slim to place a big TV with wide/deep stand). The heights between the 3 boards are good enough to put Playstation 5 / Xbox game consoles vertically as well. It is easy for us to have wires through (of course, not so good to hide those wires because there is no such a whole board at the back). The structure is solid enough.  Assembling is OK. Although the structure is simple and clear, there are too many screws to put in. I finally forfeit one of them since I am sure it doesn't hurt at all without that screw. Designers should simplify that more if possible. On Pricing perspective, a little expensive for $179.;TV Stand - Positive, Holds 55 inch TV - Positive, Depth for soundbar - Positive, Holds game consoles - Positive, Solid structure - Positive, Assembling with screws - Neutral, Expensive pricing - Negative.

"Love! Perfect shelf for my little plant collection. . It’s exactly what I was looking for. It’s aesthetically pleasing and I love the natural look with the white. It has a good weight to it and I feel it will hold up well, as long as I don’t put too much stuff on it. The metal shelving is extremely convenient since plants tend to be messy and drop water all of the time, making for easy cleaning. I also love the spacing between the shelves because they’re the perfect width apart where I can add smaller plants on the lower levels. Absolutely in love.

Always a Versatile Favorite. We wanted two eight cube units and the store was sold out so we bought four of the four cube units and what was a disappointment at first worked out to be a plus.

Love love love eket!. When we redid our daughters’ room we needed to replace their Kallax bookshelf with something only slightly narrower. I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the eket is smaller, it holds way more books! This would be because the inner and outer walls are thinner. The eket takes some more muscle to put together than kallax but you can get more functionality from the eket. Plus we liked that they have backs so our kids don’t lose things in the abyss behind the unit. Also included are the stand-off posts so it can be flush against your floor trim and the wall! My new favorite go-to piece!;Replaced with eket - neutral, holds more books - Positive, inner and outer walls thinner - Positive, takes more muscle for assembly - Neutral, more functionality - Positive, includes stand-offs - Positive, new go-to piece - Positive.

Kallax white gloss bookcases . I love these to store all my books. They are very sturdy once attached to the wall. I must say that they are not as nice as the Expedit units they replaced. They’re a bit thinner overall but still have the same interior dimensions to fit larger books. Easy to assemble except the sticky plastic  protective strips were an absolute pain to peel off. It took longer to peel all that off than to actually put the units together. Very annoying! Other than that, I would definitely recommend them. I have hundreds of books and I love how organized and beautiful everything looks.

Just what we needed!!. We needed a large bookcase to fit under our windows. when turned on the side, it fit perfectly. And because the cubbies are square, it did not affect the space.

Exceeded my expectation. I hesitated buying it because of the price and there was no sample on the floor. I took a chance and came back because the shelving unit looks bland.

it's fine... but definitely a re-engineered version of previous purchase.

Hmmmm, on the fence here.. I have the old expedit shelving that wasn’t put together exactly like they were supposed to. Close enough to work as shelving but not great for thr insets. I also bought the drawers for them although they’re not ‘fixed’ and I can take them out as needed. I have to say I was expecting a better quality door insert. This looks and feels more like cardboard! The drawer inserts are much more substantial and I had expected that for the doors! Lets mot EVEN talk about the directions and of how little help they are!

Our favorite furnishing. Kallex cubes are all over our house. We love them that much. Most recent purchase included two double cube and a single cube we are using as sturdy plant stands to keep away from new rescue pug that wants to eat everything.

Utilitarian with simple style. I got this in the As Is section of the store (my favorite!)  I didn't realize it was meant to be a TV stand until I looked it up later. I'm using it as an end piece for my IKEA Vallentuna sleeper sofa because it fits perfectly, and the glass middle shelf lets light get to the bottom shelf, where I have some ceramic decorations.

Misleading and disappointing.. I didn't realize this piece was just three different pieces put together, and that's on me, but that being said, I had issues with every piece. All the pieces are made to go together without tools, and that relies on the pieces fitting just right, and they do not. Even when I got them to slide into place they weren't flush at the corners. The instructions were beyond confusing because Ikea now refuses to put any words in their instructions and only one piece in every box was labeled at all. On the other hand, the feet required a power drill to install, and I can't see that reflected anywhere in the description. I decided not to use them, which would have been fine except I paid like $15 more for them to be included in the bundle. There was also no way that I could see to pysically attach the cubes to each other. This is my third failed Ikea build-turned-return in a row, and I'm confident in my assembly abilities. I've loved ikea for years, but they have lost my business.;Made of 3 pieces - Neutral, misleading - Negative, issues with every piece - Negative, pieces don't fit properly - Negative, confusing instructions - Negative, power drill required for feet installation - Negative, not able to attach cubes physically - Negative.
Chips easily. This is interesting to put together where it doesn’t hold by itself and kind of have to shimmy in the unit. In putting it together it chipped and I was being careful and didn’t drop it. For the price I wouldn’t recommend.;Interesting to assemble - Neutral, chips easily - Negative, price not worth it - Negative.
Just right. For something so light and easily assembled, and moderately priced, this shelf is really quite sturdy. I'm using it for plants, so the open design is perfect. The spacing between shelves is generous. I may buy another (but that would lead to buying more plants...);Lightweight - neutral, easily assembled - neutral, moderately priced - neutral, sturdy - positive, open design - positive, generous spacing - positive.

Great shelf, poor delivery. The Kallax shelf is a great and versatile bookshelf. I'm using it to display heavy books and collectibles. The different configuration options allow me to customize the unit(s) to fit my exact needs. The IKEA delivery service however was not so great. IKEA used a 3rd party delivery company that left much to be desired. The delivery was rescheduled twice and communication was inconsistent and confusing. I received text messages from the company informing me that the delivery was 30 minutes away put the gps link showed the truck at least 90 minutes away. Later the delivery was cancelled and rescheduled. When the order finally did come I received another text informing me it was 30 minutes away and immediately after a text saying delivery complete.;Great shelf - Positive, versatile - Positive, poor delivery - Negative, inconsistent communication - Negative, delayed several times - Negative, received text messages with incorrect ETAs - Negative.
I can’t drill holes into my space. Apparently, these need to be permanently affixed via screws into plaster to be safe. NO THANKS AS THAT IS NOT A VIABLE OPTION!;Can't drill holes - Negative, permanently affixed - Negative, not a viable option - Negative.

great upgrade. I wish the drawers were a little deeper, seems like the walls could be a few inches taller for even more capacity but they are a great upgrade to the single deep bin I had before. They were very easy to install and I want to complement the designers on how it's almost impossible to assemble them incorrectly because each hole and screw is different. Everything came together nicely. I struggled a bit with attaching the insert to the Kallax frame because I don't have strong enough hands to screw into the particle board but will borrow an electric screwdriver and I'm sure that'l take care of it. ;Great upgrade - Positive, wish for deeper drawers - Neutral, could be taller - Neutral, easy installation - Positive, difficulty in attaching insert - Neutral.
easy to install and functional. These inserts allowed me to sort some fabric rolls for easer access. I found the bin too deep and it quickly got so cluttered. This way my rolls are organized for easy access and less wrinkles. ;Easy to install - Positive, functional - Positive, sort fabric rolls - Positive.
Great addition to make Kallax even more effective. I've enjoyed the upgrade of Kallax. I added drawers, this shelf and the crisscross. My sewing supplies are not much more accessible. I found the large bins too deep and stuff just tended to gather on the bottom, things got wrinkled. Now everything has it's own place and is much more accessible. ;Added drawers - Positive, sewing supplies more accessible - Positive, large bins too deep - Negative, everything in place - Positive.

I did it myself! XD. This is the first time I have built an IKEA furniture. Normally my son does it for me. He is a Navy sailor and has been away from home. I wanted to remodel his room and bought this shelf to display his model cars etc. I wanted the white shelf but mistakenly took the natural wood. I was going to return it but the color was a better fit for the bedroom theme. Not to mention how easy it was to put together. I'm making a list of other pieces I wanted but found intimidating. ;Built by myself - Positive, white shelf - Neutral, natural wood - Neutral, wanted to return - Negative, easy to put together - Positive, making a list - Neutral.
"Hard to assemble if you don't follow the directions.. Follow the directions! Pay attention to the ""1"" printed on one of the pieces and get a rubber mallet and these can be assembled in 2 mins.  I first tried these without reading the directions as it was only 5 pieces. It was a nightmare. You can do the first 3 sides and then slide the particle board in and then you will spend 1hr plus losing your mind, patience, temper, etc swearing the product is defective. I even broke one trying to jam it in as it just wouldn't line up... However, my wife then asked if I followed the directions and I didn't even look at them. She then took it and followed the directions and assembled multiple of them in 2 minutes :) lol you just have to pay attention to the directions and the ""1"" and they are so easy to do but use a rubber mallet with a cloth to make it easier - thanks wife.

Frustrated!. Just bought this unit today and was excited to put it together. Talk about frustrating! Bad instructions and I couldn't get it assembled with the back panel in place. Once you align the plastic screws on 3 sides and slide in the back panel it is impossible to get the screws on the 4th side lined up AND in line with the back panel! Dinged it up a bit with my effort. Hardest piece from Ikea that I've ever tried to assemble. So disappointed!;Excited to put together - Neutral, frustrating - Negative, bad instructions - Negative, couldn't assemble back panel - Negative, hardest piece ever - Negative.
Difficult to assemble. I read the reviews and the difficult the cabinet is to assemble but I bought it anyway, which I don't completely regret because I live the design, but I'll definitely have to get a real rabbit person to assist.

If You Can Put It Together...Pieces Do Not Align Well. This piece would have been a beautiful storage option , if you can put it together that is. After trying for a few weeks, I just was not able to put these cubes together. The video provided on product's page isn't near close to reality, and customer service just recommends using Task Rabbit. There's something about these units that are not correctly lining up so that they can slide and lock into place. Ultimately, and unfortunately have to make the trek to return.;Difficult assembly - Negative, Does not align well - Negative, cubes - Neutral, customer service unhelpful - Negative, cannot lock into place - Negative.
Almost impossible to build. The assembly process almost took me down. Down to a sad, dark, dark place. In lieu of regular screws, it is necessary to wedge into place plastic screws that required maximum force to set into place — including sitting on it, jumping on it with the full force of a grown adult, and ultimately banging it at full intensity and speed with a hammer, which admittedly provided an outlet for the pent up frustration. Do not buy this unless you are ready to face the ultimate challenge;Impossible assembly - Negative, required maximum force - Negative, sitting, jumping - Neutral, full intensity and speed hammer - Neutral, not recommended - Negative.

Nice Craft Table Option. Well-built and thought out. We set ours up vertically. The hardware kit comes with two shelf braces, so the table doesn't rely too heavily on the wood shelf it's mounted on. The bookshelf also comes with wall anchors which I highly recommend if you have children using this. It was easy to install. Took a little bit of effort to level the legs. TIP: to start, lay the table face down with legs up and adjust the height of the legs to the shelf that you want to mount to. From there, when you flip it, you can adjust and level. All holes are pre-drilled for you except where the table bracket mounts to the shelf and where the braces will mount under each shelf, but the little screws are pretty well-self tapping. I piloted the first few and then found out I can just put pressure and turn them in manually. This is WAY WAY sturdier and well built than then the lame Walmart Better Homes and Garden version that I previously purchased and promptly returned.;Well-built - Positive, thought out design - Positive, easily installed - Positive, sturdy - Positive, recommended wall anchors - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, noteworthy improvement - Positive, better than Walmart version - Negative.

"Perfect. We've recently moved into an incredibly small apartment. The kitchen hardly has any cupboard space at all and we were seriously lacking space for our food.

I ran to my local hardware store. 2: START WITH SIDE LABELED 1! The easiest way for me to see it was keeping the four sides together and looking for 1. But 1 is ALWAYS a piece with plastic pegs. ALWAYS. The pieces without pegs are what I think of as sides 2 & 3. 3: When putting on sides 2, put the round peg all the way into the round hole, if you only get it halfway in and slide; take it out; do it again. After the round peg is in the round hole, I grabbed the eket booklet, put it on top of the joint I was joining & pounded it until it was flat. This worked without fail.

Lesser quality than previous years. For anyone who has bought these over the years, you can immediately tell that the quality has gone down significantly from years past. Most of the wood is now semi-hollow and made of particle board basically. If you tighten a screw too much, it can easily break loose - the wood fails long before there is any chance of hurting the screw.  These obviously still work, and provide what I need, but I do not expect my recent purchase of these to last as long as my older purchases of the same item.;Quality gone down - Negative, made of particle board - Negative, fails easily - Negative, does not last long - Negative.
Really like these!. I have a number of these bookshelves in my home. I put two 4x2s with a 3x3 to use as a TV wall unit.

Great for storage!. This went together easily and is strong and sturdy!!;Easily goes together - Positive, strong and sturdy - Positive.
Perfect storage solution. These units are the perfect solution for storing small kitchen appliances in a breakfast nook. Living in an apartment, my kitchen just didn't have the counter space for my small appliances. The height and size is perfect, I was able to fit two of these along a breakfast area wall. Now I have extra storage, plus a cute coffee area.;Perfect storage solution - Positive, fits small appliances - Positive, height is perfect - Positive, size is perfect - Positive, extra storage - Positive, breakfast nook - neutral.
This thing was so hard. This thing was so hard to put together. You would think the peg hole system would make it easier. I ended up returning it because the top would not sit flush.;Hard to put together - Negative, peg hole system - Neutral, returned - Negative.
Pay Attention to Assembly. One of the panels is labeled (1)  They all look identical but this one has different groves.  If you don’t assemble correctly in reference to that 1 piece you will not be able to get the backing on!

Awesome Sturdy and well made. I've had this item for over a year and it still looks as good as the day I bought it home. I have it in my room and it serves as my home office. The shelving unit is study, I have books, DVD player, cable box, many pictures and other heavy items on the bottom and this shelf holds them like a more expensive wood piece. It looks good in my room and makes the room fell airy and big. Awesome unit. It took my daughter and I less than an hour to put both pieces together. They are separate, so you don't have to keep them together, although I have them together.;Well made - Positive, sturdy - Positive, looks good - Positive, holds heavy items - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive.
Cats love it. My cat has allergies and so do I so trying to get away from anything that doesn’t fit in washing machine, I added legs to this and put it in the window for Stella to have a bed on top to watch the birds and Mrs Wolowitz loves the cat house insert in a lower cube!!;Cat bed - Positive, fits window - Positive, add legs - Positive, removable cat house - Positive.
The product is great. Assembly. The product is great. Assembly was a bit of a challenge as the holes didn't line up for the final screws. We had to take it apart and shorten the dowels to get the final holes to line up. It was fine after that.;Product is great - Positive, Assembly was a challenge - Negative, Holes didn't line up - Negative, Finalized assembly - Positive.
Great asset to Kallax. Love how you can adjust your Kallax to different needs with these add-ons.;Adjustable - Positive, love - Positive, for different needs - Neutral, great asset - Positive.
Works fine but not perfect. 1. I really want to see other color options, matching all colors available for Kallax cubes. 2. I'd also love to see more configurations, because 1 shelf is too generous, and 3 shelves are too tight for my needs (sheet music). May be, pre-drilled inserts with additional shelves sold separately to allow configurations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 shelves at customer discretion. 3. It would be nice if these inserts were compatible with door inserts. And it is a little bit expensive in my opinion.;Works fine - Neutral, not perfect - neutral, color options - negative, configurations - neutral, a little expensive - negative, compatible with door inserts - neutral.
A little disappointed.. The Kallax cube divider works horizontally or vertically. There were a couple cubes the divider was an extremely difficult to get in and other cubes it slid right in. My only issue was one of the holes the pegs go in was so close to the edge it split slightly when the peg was inserted.;Kallax cube divider - Neutral, works horizontally or vertically - Neutral, difficult to place cubes - Negative, hole split when inserting pegs - Negative.

VERSATILE, ATTRACTIVE, STURDY. We are using these wall units in different configurations, and for different purposes.

Super awesome shelf. I waited for this specific shelf/color to be in stock. It's my first Kallax shelf. First Ikea piece of furniture for that matter. It is exactly what I'd hoped.

I was surprised with the quality of the shelf, they turned out very nice!;Lacking storage - neutral, purchased two - neutral, one person assembly - Positive, took no time - Positive, surprised with quality - Positive.
Nice, but don't deviate. It's hard to compete with Ikea. Great looks, great price. I purchased thinking this line - Eket and Kallax, were compatible with each other. No, that's not the case at all. That bit cost me $70 in accessories that I won't be getting back. Otherwise the shelving looks great.;Great looks - Positive, great price - Positive, incompatible with other line - Negative, $70 in accessories - Negative.
Kallax Drawers. Already had the shelving unit, the drawers fit really well. It's nice that you can change up the unit and reconfigure it.;Fit well - Positive, changeable - Positive.

Wobbly. This shelf looks nice and offers the storage that I needed, but it is super wobbly - like moves at least an inch side to side wobbly. I’m debating if I want to go through the hassle of exchanging it or just deal with the wobbly-ness…;Nice looks - Neutral, offers storage - Neutral, wobbly - Negative.

Good Quality for Price!. I own multiple of these shelves, and they have been pretty sturdy and help up so far. The quality seems pretty good and it is easy to clean and maintain.  Pros: + Easy to assemble. + Bars and glass shelves feel sturdy. + Looks good / simple to fit into most places.  Cons: - Wooden top and bottom shelf panels can scratch easily (but like typical Ikea furniture). - You cannot buy replacement parts individually if something breaks.;Good quality for price - Positive, multiple owned - Neutral, sturdy - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, glass and bars feel sturdy - Positive, wooden shelves can scratch easily - Neutral, replacement parts not available individually - Negative.

Update is good, not great. I'd purchased Kallax door inserts some years ago, and at the time they were difficult to position and added a lot of weight to the shelves. The new version is much lighter and easier to position and attach, but the material beyond the door is a bit too flimsy. One of the new doors doesn't quite match up with the frame, and on none of the doors does the silicon bumper make a difference in noise emitted by closing it. But I like them anyway!;Update - neutral, lighter - Positive, easier to position - Positive, flimsy material - negative, doors don't fit properly - negative, silicon bumper doesn't work - neutral, like them anyway - positive.
An Interesting and Useful Piece. I didn't believe the IKEA guy when he said that it could easily hold 33 lbs. It is so lightweight, smooth and pretty, and I had no idea what it was when I saw it on my way to check out, but maybe it could solve the problem of my microwave oven cord being too short to fit any of my electric outlets while placed on any counter or current furniture. Actually, it is built to hold up to 50 lbs. It fit under the end of my breakfast bar near the electric outlet, and my microwave fits neatly on top. The cubbies below can hold items too big for my cupboards. It wipes off nicely.;Lightweight and smooth - Neutral, holds 33 lbs but can hold 50 lbs - Positive, microwave holder - Positive, wipes off easily - Positive.
. I bought this a couple of days ago and when I opened the boxes, I only found the wooden parts. There were no assembly instructions. Also the hardware parts like the screws and stuff was missing.

Kallax. Good for storing my vinyl albums. ;Good for storing albums - Positive.
Bad engineered design. . These are nice from the way they look, however, the engineering appears to be done by someone who had a brief lapse in the basics of physics.  Specifically, three sides connect together by aligning preset connectors into pre-drilled holes then sliding about 1/2 in. to lock into place.  You then slide the back piece into a pre-cut groove in each of the three sides.  Easy-peasy.  The problem arises when attaching the final side.  As the starting position to align the connectors to the pre-drilled holes is about 1/2 higher than the final placement once the connecters are slid into the locking position, the back does not therefore line up with the pre-cut groove in the final piece  This prevents the connectors from being able to fully go into the pre-drilled holes, and not allowing then to slide down into locked position.    Extremely, extremely frustrating.  Simple pre-drilled holes and screws would make a tighter fit and take minutes to assemble. ;Bad engineered design - negative, nice appearance - neutral, problematic assembly - negative, engineering issue - negative, not tight fit - negative.

Assembly Disaster. Many wooden dowels snapped while trying to put together, IKEA should provide extras. The instructions are poor, the direction of the boards is facing is important but there’s little to guide you until it’s too late. I basically made every misstep possible, ruined my evening and damaged some of the shelf. Wish they’d try a little harder with the instructions and provide extra dowels.;Assembly experience - negative, many dowels snapped - negative, instructions are poor - negative, ruined evening - negative.
Ultimate utility. I've been using various Kallax combinations for years, including turning five-shelf giant into a kitchen pantry. I currently have five separate shelving units in my apartment to provide storage for all sorts of things. They're sturdy and spacious and easy to assemble.

Just what we needed. We've been looking for something nicer to store our cats' food and this fit every perfectly. We have a few other Ikea pieces so it worked in space.

Don’t buy these!. Bought them almost 2yrs ago, just now getting around to putting them up! Yay quarantine!!! If you do the math it $22.50 per cube, 1/3 of them broke, or the backing was too tall or too wide, therefore not being able to fully assemble. Unless you want a janky looking cube with no back. Which we resorted to! For $22 a cube, you EXPECT better!;Bought 2 years ago - neutral, assembling now - neutral, breaking or improperly sized cubes - Negative.
Perfect size and good mix with Besta, Billy, Kallax. Variety is the spice of life. And also to a room layout.   A mix-up of Eket and Besta, using those series small- and medium-sized cabinets, has given life and spark to what would otherwise be a long, narrow, windowless, low (aka dark and boring) wall in our lounge/family/media room.   The scale of the two series is a perfect complement to the room’s dimensions. And building a rhythm of cabinet heights, all in a line, looks artful, but is still easily aligned to carrying our large flat screen.   Having Eket available for the room’s furnishing definitely makes the room pop.  In another room, a small office/projects room, five Eket, single- and double- doored cabinets, line the walls across from a low run of Kallax units. A short, narrow Billy, is popped in among the Ekets.   Three shallow, single-door Ekets have been stacked up (easy and safe to do with the Eket wall brackets. TY, Ikea!), in a corner just behind the room’s door. The stack works like a tall utility cabinet, without the tall utility cabinet aesthetic (love it).   Otherwise, on other wall two two-door Ekets do storage and display duty , one under a loved painting, the other under a window.   TY, IKEA, for adding the EKET series to your cabinets. Their scale and variety is a game changer.;Perfect size - Positive, complements other series - Positive, easy to stack - Positive, artful alignment - Positive, adds life to room - Positive.

It's all right, but you have to install and handle with care. The door and the insert fit perfectly size-wise, however, the doors are hard to align perfectly. Additionally, the screws are so short that if you don't watch out you might pull the door out of its socket. Then, it's impossible to put it back.;Size-wise fit - Neutral, hard to align doors - Negative, short screws - Negative, careful handling - Neutral.

Quietly classic, adjustable, and sturdy. We currently have the bookshelves in two places in our home—group of 4 lined up in a low attic space and another as a single bookshelves and display in an open-door closet—but we chose them for their versatility over time. In the future, I can see us using a shelf for holding records or as an entryway drop zone.

Spacious and elegant shelves. I love these shelves. Actually I bought four of them for my plant room! I had concern based on reviews I read that they may not be stable but I had no problem. I keep heavy terracotta pots on each one and they seem firm in place. They look very pretty and they can accommodate a lot of pots of things, but in the same time they don’t look too big.

Great Shelving. I bought this as an option for shelving and organization in my bathroom. It does come out about 10 inches, so need to plan appropriately for over the toilet (if that's where you are hanging it). The depth makes it great for towels and other items that you might place in containers.  It was really easy to assemble.  I also painted it to match with the decor in my bathroom. ;Bathroom shelving - Neutral, comes out 10 inches - Neutral, easy to assemble - Positive, great for storing towels - Positive, easy to paint - Positive.

Great design, slightly tricky assembly. I love the look and practicality of the unit. I deducted a star because assembly was a little tricky. The shelves do not have pre drilled holes and instead you have to use sharp screws provided to cut into the wood yourself, while also holding the wood in place even though it doesn't sit perfectly flush (you have to assess whether it is even on both sides). Eventually I got it well enough, but this could be improved.;Great design - Positive, Practicality - Positive, assembly - Negative, self drilling screws - Neutral, assessment required - neutral, wood alignment - neutral.

"Doesn't come with connectors. I ordered this set as pictured- with the cubed shelf connected to the one tall one with the door. I knew this would need to be connected, but nowhere in the description or ""good to know"" section told me that I needed to order the connectors as well.

Top & bottom shelves are. Top & bottom shelves are a wood based material, and are supposed to be screwed onto the shelves. Unfortunately, I didn't have a drill and the material is super dense, so I wasn't able to use a punch to create a pilot hole for the screws.  The other issue I ran into, it was a me problem most likely, was that 2 of the posts have holes that need to be aligned with each other - but are otherwise identical. I missed this fact, despite reading the instructions before attempting assembly, and had to partially disassemble the unit to correct the mistake.

Assembly makes this piece not worth it. I bought this piece with expectations for assembly to be similar to the things I have bought from Ikea in the past - not the easiest but also not terrible if you have time and patience. However the assembly for this piece is honestly like torture. There really aren't any screws involved with this piece of furniture, just a lot of meeting the plastic ends in the holes and pushing them down to make it align. The pieces are not easy to align at all, I had to resort to a hammer which did the trick but damaged the piece of furniture itself so now I have a damaged piece of furniture, and good luck trying to get the last/final piece matched up and put together. Price is great and its not a bad piece but if I would have known what the assembly process would've been like before I purchased this I would not have bought it. Also, the door to my cabinet is unaligned due to bad pre-made holes and there's been nothing I can do to align it.;Assembly difficult - Negative, pieces hard to align - Negative, damaged during assembly - Negative, door unaligned - Negative, price is great - Neutral.
Great entry area cabinet. I'm using this in my back door entry for shoes and recycling. It looks great and holds a lot. Some of the pieces put up some resistance during assembly. I used a rubber mallet and very gentle taps to get them set. Not all parts needed that. If you decide to buy taller feet you'll need 8 total. I bought a 4 pack and had to order another. The cubes and the cabinet don't attach to each other so they need their own feet.;Entry area cabinet - Positive, holds a lot - Positive, looks great - Positive, some resistance during assembly - neutral, needed additional feet - neutral.

looks beautiful. It added the chic minimalistic vibe I was going for. LOVE it. The only thing I had an issue with was that the wood slabs for the top and bottom shelves did not have the premade holes.

Uniqueness makes this interesting as display wal. Using two of these as a display wall. The varying widths and shelving distance make for an interesting look. This is pressed board, not solid wood.

Happy with purchase;Varying widths - Positive, interesting look - Positive, pressed board - Neutral, shelving supports short - Negative, looked good - Positive, happy purchase - Positive.
Looks really nice. I bought two of these. I was able to put them together by myself in about 3 hours and that is with toddlers helping me. 😂 You need space to put them together. They are actually quite big. I like that the shelves can be varying and makes for a pleasant look.

Ehh….. Shelves are wonderful, but the assembly process was terrible. Instructions were too basic, no words to help. Half the time it shows holes for the wood and other times it doesn’t. The screws didn’t screw, the little things that connect the shelves didn’t work until you push as hard as you can (using 3 people). Overall the shelves work, but if you struggle with putting things together, I would just pay the assembly fee.;Wonderful shelves - Positive, terrible assembly process - Negative, basic instructions - Negative, no clear markings for screw holes - Negative, didn't screw easily - Negative.

Love . Please do not discontinue the FJALKINGE shelf unit with drawers!! This is one of my favorite ikea designs.  I love it’s simplicity and practicality, it works in either a living room or bedroom. I also like how there is flexibility in where you put the shelves and drawers (I install the drawers lower). This piece is tall and shallow so it gives you lots of storage without taking up much room.

Well made, very accurate. The shelves went together easily, even though I assembled it in an upright position, because I worked alone (oh, I broke a peg, but you thoughtfully included a spare).  The pieces were very accurate, and fit perfectly.

Ikea changes Expedit dimensions to meet new eco goals. As an owner of several Expedit shelving unit I thought those were marvelously cost efficient and sturdy units. I finally had to break down and buy the smaller Kallax units when the need for new storage arose. The Kallax is basically a slightly smaller exterior dimension version of the Expeditor with the same interior storage shelf dimensions. However, the new units feel distinctly less robust and the exterior finish cladding also seems a bit cheaper looking. I understand that Ikea will save considerable wood product given the enormous volume of Kallax that they sell worldwide, but I still lament the passing of the better quality Expedit.;Marvelously cost efficient Expedit shelves - Positive, sturdy units - Positive, broke down and bought Kallax - Neutural, feel less robust - Negative, cheaper looking exterior finish - Negative, understand Ikea's eco goals - Neutral.

perfect pantry storage!. I bought this shelving unit to use in my walk-in pantry and I bought the corresponding cabinets w/door, wine insert and the insert that makes one cubby into two. I put this together (not including the inserts I bought separately) in about 2 hours because I took my time. I would also use a rubber mallet if you have one. It makes it so much easier to tap in the wooden dowels which connects each section. It takes two people to lift it and it includes safety anchors that keep it from falling. The optional inserts give this shelving unit a customized look and I love the 15-inch depth which allows each cubby to hold more items than a regular bookshelf. I wish these IKEA reviews allowed for pictures to be posted but I couldn't see where that was an option. My pantry looks so organized and bright now!

Wonderful and versatile!!. We purchased two of these for our sunroom to hold our many many books haha! We not only have created an oasis of a library but a place for our plants to thrive on leaving enough space for a beanbag chair to get cozy to read! These are great because you don’t have to buy the frame to lay this on its side like we did. You can stand these upright and they would work great for storing things anywhere in the home. It could work in the kitchen for extra storage, could work in the dining room for holding China or commonly used items. It could also be a display place or put baskets in for hidden away functionality. It can be used I.

Truly terrible!!!. I generally don't have any complaint about putting together IKEA furniture and the 4x4 Kallax shelf I bought for this to go into was easy and straightforward to assemble. These inserts are a terror, however. It's basically just a scored piece of very thin MDF that you attach to the sides of the shelf with short screws. Except it is virtually impossible to get the screws to go all the way in, leaving the cabinet door lopsided.

Easy to assemble and gets kallax off the floor. These were super easy to assemble. I appreciate they came with additional hardware for the kallax if you're adding them to a unit you already have at home.

Horrible. There was half of a broken piece in the screws bag so I went to Ikea to get a new piece.

Ikea is very unorganized.;Broken piece in screws bag - Negative, went to Ikea for new piece - Negative, broken piece in furniture - Negative, unorganized - Negative.
Poor Materials. Kallax had poor materials and poor fit. Assembly relied on long, thin wooden rods to connect some of the shelves together, but rods that easily snap and often poorly fit together. Even the wooden rods that didn't snap left the the shelves very flimsy.

I couldn’t find the directions so put it together myself as I could figure it out by the picture on the website. My husband had to put the screws into the wood for me. Didn’t take too long to put together. I laid out the pieces where they looked like they fit, double checked everything before putting it together. Price was good. Shipping cost was extremely high so drove 3.5 hours each way to pick up in person. There were no extra pieces at all so be extremely careful that none are lost.

Nice bookcase-lots of cardboard & packing. I would rate the book case as very nice, typical Ikea. Assembly was the usual Ikea pita, but all parts fit with no problems. Took me a couple of hours - it's much easier with better tools like a ratchet or power screwdriver.  This is packaged in two boxes (one very long - the height of the unit.). The two generated a large, maybe shocking amount of cardboard waste. In addition to the boxes there is quite a bit of internal packing material. Yeah... all recyclable, but after cutting it up to small pieces and collapsing the packing it still took almost half of my weekly recycling bin.  There must be a better way, but I don't know what it is. So down one star for the mess made.;Nice bookcase - Positive, typical Ikea - Neutral, assembly - neutral, large cardboard waste - negative, recyclable - neutral, could be improved - neutral.

Hard to install. Kallax inserts are hard to install without a drill or electric screw driver. They look great once installed.;Hard to install - Negative, look great - Positive.
Poorly Designed. IKEA usually makes great products, but this is a rare miss.  There are no pre-drilled holes for the door hinges on the furniture, so you have to measure and mark the location yourself. Also, the opening for the screws to secure the hinges is oblong, so you can adjust the height slightly. This leaves significant room for error both vertically and horizontally. If the inner hinges aren't perfectly lined up with the piece attached to the door, the door will never lie flush. Also, the pressed board shelving unit doesn't hold the screws in place, so they can pop out easily.  I recommend skipping these doors and opting for bins. I can't speak for the drawers, but they probably suffer from the same lack of specificity.;Poorly designed - Negative, no pre-drilled holes - Negative, oblong screw openings - Negative, room for error - Negative, pressboard shelves - Negative, doors recommended to be avoided - Neutral, cannot confirm about drawers - Neutral.
Took work to install.. While the doors are good, installing them was rough. The Kallax units do not have areas for the door hinge, so you have to make your own. This made things a bit difficult.;Installing doors - negative, good doors - neutral.
Lasts 2 days. I built the shelf and put the insert doors in on Sunday. It is now Tuesday and, within those two days, 3 of the 8 doors have completely ripped off leaving huge holes.

NOT HAPPY - Must Put Holes in Your Unit to Use. These need to be screwed into your actual bookcase which will put holes in it. I think IKEA should make this clear in their description. I would not have bought these if I known they had to be screwed in. WHY did they change these to this cheap option.;Need screws into bookcase - Negative, IKEA description unclear - Negative, change to cheap option - Negative.
"Old inserts were good- These are TERRIBLE. I sent my husband to the store to pick up 5 of these after an online order did not arrive when it was supposed to. I wish I had seen them first. Ikea totally cheaped out on these! They are flimsy cardboard, very cheaply made but sold at a price that commands better quality. I would not pay more than $12 for this product. Where the cardboard bends back to overlap (providing ""strength"" at the attachment point), the paper splits. The insert frame does not sit completely flush in the cube. The hardware doesn't sit perfectly in the bore AND the hinge is not adjustable, so you can't hang these so that the door closes flush either. You have to damage the Kallax unit to use any inserts now, so when you realize these are crap and remove them for return, you are left with holes and scrape marks. And just a heads up: prepare for the most annoying returns process anywhere. Cancelling an online order and returning what I already have here.

Nice bookshelf with optional storage. I have to admit I was inspired by a few of the desk setup videos on YouTube that featured this shelf and drawer combination. Aesthetically, the shelves and two drawers look very nice. In actual use I found the drawers themselves to be more shallow than expected and do not pull out as far as I would like. My IKEA store didn't have an example on the showroom floor so I bought without actually seeing it fully assembled in real life.

Follow directions carefully to avoid common problem.. I have bought several of these and it was very easy to assemble. If it didn’t slide together, I just used a mallet and it went together just fine. * I have seen several reviews that said they had trouble putting the last piece in place because the back panel was too long. I ran into this problem too and realized that it was because I hadn’t followed the directions correctly. It is easy to miss but the first side you start with is supposed to have a 1 on it. It is easy to miss! It is really important however, because the side with a 1 on it has a deeper groove so the back piece can slide down so you can slide the last piece in. I was able to slide the pieces apart so I could redo it and it worked just like it’s supposed.;Easy to assemble - Positive, followed directions carefully - Neutral, ran into problem - neutral, deeper groove - neutral, pieces slide apart - neutral.
Looks great, but impossible to put together.. On some of my small square pieces, the pegs/dowels got stuck and broke before inserting another board. After IKEA sent two new boards and pegs when the unit was completed. The last screw kept turning and turning, it would not enter the final board. Now my kallax is in pieces and the dowels/pegs are of course stuck in the boards. It was quite difficult to build a 3x4 unit. It would be nice to pay extra and have it assembled at the store, but no taskrabbit for me, fore I live one hour away. The entire unit will be returned.

DOES NOT FIT!. I'm so confused why you advertise this to fit in your cubes when they are clearly too big.

Usually love Ikea furniture, but it looks like these must have been damaged at some point in the factory process which was a little disappointing.

Kallax bookcase. We are using this bookcase as a bench to sit on, in our foyer.  Delivery & Assembly was easy. It is sturdy enough to hold a good amount of weight.

Great. The doors make this unit look classy.;Doors - Positive, looks classy - Positive.
Kallax door insert. This insert would be so much better if it didn’t NEED to be secured to the shelf. I like to periodically reassess and revise my storage & decor, but having to drill holes limits that. I don’t like having to permanently deface a permanent fixture for something that make not work for me in six months.

Elevates kalax look. Sturdy base that elevates the look of the kalax system. We used small wood screws to attach it to the kalax. I would recommend this if you are looking at it. We are using this and the kalax with cabinet doors and drawers for an entryway console. We love the look and its functionality. Worth the money!;Elevates look - Positive, Sturdy base - Positive, Functional - Positive, recommending it - Positive.

Yarn Storage. Perfect for separating Kallax bins for yarn storage.;Yarn storage - Positive, perfect for separating bins - Positive.
Easy to build!. This was one of the easiest pieces of IKEA furniture I've ever had to build. You do need two people! But my husband and I out this together in less than a half hour. I'm using it as a bedside shelf/table for extra storage in our small room. I do wish it had a few more screws in the center to stabilize it further but mostly it's just wooden pegs in the center parts. So it's not the most sturdy thing ever. I do wish they had a dark brown option but I may stain it.;Easy to build - Positive, requires 2 people - Neutural, used as bedside table - Neutral, not very sturdy - Negative, lacks more screws for stability - Negative, lacks dark brown option - Neutral.

Easy to assemble and just. Easy to assemble and just what a needed for the space in my bedroom.;Easy to assemble - Positive, met my space need - Positive.
Stack Up. Once it's all assembled, the shelf unit looks good and appears sturdy. However, assembly is somewhat tiresome and at the end more work than expected. When looking at the unit standing vertically, the horizontal shelves require hammering with a hammer and board to protect the thick side panels. The worse part is the last vertical divider has to be shaved between 1/32 and 1/16 of an inch in order to have the thick top panel lay flat across the side panels and not rock on the center divider. Once I figured this out, the final assembly was fine. I believe it is a result of the tolerance stack-up of the horizontal shelf thickness and overall height of the vertical members will always result in a dimension slightly larger than the side panel heights.;Assembly tiresome - Negative, appears sturdy - Positive, horizontal shelves require hammering - Negative, shaving last divider - Neutral, goodlooking - Positive.
Sturdy. Love Kallax for craft room storage and display. Easy and quick to put together. Good price point. Great variety of sizes and uses.;Love for craft room storage - Positive, sturdy - Positive, easy and quick assembly - Positive, good price point - Positive, great variety of sizes - Positive, uses - neutral.

Versatile, but . . .. Kallax is versatile, and it has a clean aesthetic appeal, but it's far from robust, so we'll have to see how it wears. The doors and related cube enclosures are not easy to install using Ikea instructions, particularly getting the hinges to sit properly.;Versatile - Positive, clean aesthetic - Positive, not robust - Negative, doors installation - Negative.
Better instructions for assembling. The instructions are difficult to follow because didn’t indicate what littler parts use and every single hole.;Difficult to follow instructions - Negative.
Hard to assemble. The screws were not set properly. It was hard to make use of the screw and connect joints. So it was shaky and felt flimsy.;Hard to assemble - Negative.

Great!. Great and easy to put together!;Easy to put together - positive.
Got what I wanted and planned for.. Same as above;Received expected item - Neutral.
Frustrating to put together but looks great. Oh man, for such a tiny item, it was very frustrating to put together. I'd rather put together 10 of the stands these go into than ever do this again. You will have to screw into the stand to get this to fit right. So make sure you are 100 percent sure where you want this to go. Once you have put this together it looks awesome and the drawers are perfect. I use mine as a make up drawer as I use my table as a get ready staging area. It works for what I need it to.;Frustrating to assemble - Negative, Looks great - Positive, Awesome finished product - Positive, Perfect drawers - Positive.
Good but..... It is geed and works well but it could hold more with a little change. The walls of the drawer itself could be taller making it ever more useful.;Works well - Positive, could hold more - Neutive, drawers could be taller - Neutral.
Great add on. The concept of being able to add it later, for drawers is really great. Feel like the look of them isn’t as clean as some drawers look a little crooked.;Add on - Positive, great concept - Positive, crooked look - neutral.
Nice customization for the Kallax cubes. Love that the drawers slide very easily, and close with a light tap. Only improvement I would like is for drawer sides to be higher.;Customization for cubes - Positive, Easy-sliding drawers - Positive, Close with light tap - Positive, Higher drawer sides - Negative.
Nice Shelving Unit. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this went together. Took my husband about 40 minutes to assemble one unit. No issues so far. Using it for my craft room and once things are organized, I think it will work well.;Nice shelving unit - positive, easy assembly - positive, husband assembled one unit - neutral, organizing craft room - neutral, works well - positive.
EKET 4 cubby cabinet. Very nice quality. went together easily ( I followed instructions). My only wish is that the base with legs had been available- I would have liked that look, but the single wood legs I got do look good with the white cabinet;Very nice quality - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, single wood legs - Neutral, missed base with legs - Negative.
UGH!. The only IKEA is nearly forty minutes from me. I bought this item and decided to put it together today. What should’ve taken about ten minutes to assemble with minimal effort ended up taking nearly an hour and an unnecessary amount of work. All because the two side panels are reverse threaded on every side. When tightening the screws, the screws go perfectly into the top and bottom and repel the two inserts. It makes putting the two pieces together nearly impossible. Unfortunately I’m too busy working and gas is too expensive to return this item, especially since there’s no guarantee whichever piece I purchase won’t be the same or worse. Very inconvenient.;Far from IKEA store - negative, assembly time consuming - negative, reverse threaded panels - negative, difficulty assembling - negative.
Good and reasonable price. Easy to install and lightweight;Good price - Positive, Reasonable price - Positive, Easy to install - Positive, Lightweight - Positive.
Perfect for my pantry. Very sturdy. A little tricky to put together, so I suggest an extra pair of hands;Perfect for pantry - Neutral, very sturdy - Positive, tricky to assemble - neutral.
Album Shelves. I Love These Shelves;Love these shelves - Positive - No specific key characteristic mentioned in the sentence.
Excellent all-pupose shelves. These shelves are deeper than normal bookshelves, so great for storing stuff. Easy to assemble. I added 2 drawer units and 2 cupboard doors - also easy. They look really nice.;Deeper shelves - positive, easy to assemble - positive, added drawer units - positive, added cupboard doors - positive, nice looking - positive.
Nice Unit. Nice bookcase. I like that the top and bottom shelves are wood and only the center is glass - no need for me to worry about the cats if they decide to jump up on it. Fairly easy assembly once I found a video. This will probably end up in my home office. However, I took off a star because the wood shelves were not predrilled and it was extremely difficult to get the bottom shelf on. You will need a drill or electric screwdriver with drill bit to drill the holes for the screws.;Nice bookcase - Positive, Top and bottom shelves are wood - Positive, Glass center - Neutral, Easy assembly - Positive, Finding instructional video - Positive, Fairly easy - Positive, Will end up in home office - Neutral, Not pre-drilled shelves - Negative, Difficult to attach bottom shelf - Negative.
Toughest Ikea build I've ever done!. This review is for placing two pieces next to each other. I put together two Baggegos, then I took them apart, then I put them together again. I've put together five Hyllis and know that lightweight metal shelving can be very forgiving yet not at all forgiving. Adjusting two Baggegos next to each other for over an hour, they varied in angles that were half an inch off. which might've been ok for one piece, but when next to each other, no. I had to duct tape them together tightly to get them to properly align while adjusting. My knuckles were red from the mesh metal so I went in our toolbox to find a ratcheting phillips head screwdriver. You need a phillips with a fatter head and a skinnier handle, or better, a ratcheting handle. And you might need some duct tape or zip ties. One positive thing is that the screws are sturdy, the threads survived many adjustments. All that said, Baggebo is nice for us plant people because it lets light through the mesh surfaces, and it's fairly priced.;Toughest build - negative, Baggego pieces - neutral, half inch angle variance - negative, adjustment required - negative, fatter headed screwdriver - neutral, fairly priced - neutral, plant people friendly - positive.
Poorly made. This is a very poorly made shelving unit. It’s held together with little wood pegs that make it very shaky. When trying to move it into a room without much room to maneuver I had to tip it up on it’s side a bit. That shift of weight broke all the wood pegs and collapsed the whole thing down on itself. So now I’m out the price of the unit and a trip to the dump.;Poorly made - Negative, held together with wood pegs - Negative, shaky - Negative, collapsed - Negative.
Perfect. Just what we needed to give us the storage we needed.;Gave us needed storage - Positive, Perfect - Positive.
Plastic was not white. I received this to put in my alternative kallax but I opened it up to find the rims of the shelf were covered with PE-LD 04 black labels that I could NOT get off. defeated the slim look. never got to put it together and now have to return it at the store. :(;Received shelf - Neutral, rims covered in black labels - Negative, could not remove labels - Negative, defeat slim look - Negative, returned to store - Negative.
Perfect Record Storage. For storing my record collection these are perfect;Perfect for record storage - positive, suitable for record collection - positive.
Great wall storage!. Great for my apartment with a very small closet. :);Great wall storage - Positive, small apartment - Neutral.

Love the cabinet. Easy to assemble good quality;Easy to assemble - Positive, good quality - Positive.
Sturdy. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.;Easy assembly - Positive, Sturdy - Positive.
Good shelf just a little pricey. I've got these shelf in a couple of different configuration and this one is the smallest of them all. I needed the shelf for a small area and thats why I didn't get the bigger one. For the price I think this is a little expensive when you compare to the little larger one (2x2) for example. If you need the shelf for a specific space like I did and want to keep the style than you have no choice. Overall good quality that you would expect from Ikea;Small configuration - neutral, good shelf - Positive, pricey - negative, specific space - neutral, good quality - positive.
Do not buy. I don't know why there are such great reviews. I opened the product and automatically wanted to return. First, all of the wood panels need extra coats of paint. I'm not sure how to say it correctly, but you can see the wood holes/marks which some might like, but there are blue streaks on every single panel. There are also dents and markings to a lot of the pieces. I would not recommend this product.;Wood panels require extra coats of paint - Neutral, wood holes/marks visible - Neutral, blue streaks on panels - Negative, dents and markings - Negative.
A wonderful item for storing games. I have watched many game reviewers as they sit in front of KALLAX units filled with games. I finally decided to try this out -- and I am so glad I did! This is the perfect game storage solution. I love these things.;Game storage solution - Positive, love these things - Positive.
Time for BETTER directions an BETTER connecttions. I own MANY KALLAX units. My first large purchase 9 months ago was assembled by a friend. I recently assembled a second purchase myself.   I bought many items from IKEA back in the early 1990s, shortly after they opened in Philly. I now live in an IKEA-free zone. I can't believe that the hardware, during the intervening years, has become cheesier, and the assembly directions remain vague in every language. The reason for the first is obvious: profit. The second is unconscionable: laziness.   I had to reassemble this unit just as I was about to begin the unpleasant task of wall mounting it when I realized one side was in the opposite direction. The directions sheets LOOK as if they were printed in the 1990s as they are so faded. I had to look VERY carefully to comprehend my mistake -- FINALLY seeing two tiny dots on at the end of each panel that must align for mounting. Add an arrow noting they must align!!!  The wall mounting is another sad story.;Bought many KALLAX units - Neutral, vague assembly directions - Negative, faded directions sheets - Negative, hardware quality - Negative, had to assemble twice - Negative, wall mounting - Negative.
Kallax in glossy white. I picked up two 2 by 4 Kallax shelves. The first was a bit difficult to put together, but by modifying instructions became much easier. The second came with one of the short shelf pieces missing its gloss paint so that the shelf only goes along the wall until I paint over the raw edge. Both shelves gained small chips and indentations as they were put together, nothing major, but a bit of a bummer as they were brand new. If they were easier to put together and came in perfect condition, they’d be great. Still love the look of the white gloss and they will work for now.;2 by 4 Kallax shelves - Neutral, Glossy white - Positive,first difficult to put together - Negative, second missing paint - Negative, chipped and indented - Neutral.
Awesome piece of furniture!. Easy to assemble and sturdy. You can find multiple uses for this. Stand it up or lay on it’s side.;Easy to assemble - Positive, sturdy - Positive, multiple uses - Neutral.
Crafter’s heaven. Great addition to the bookshelves. It hides lots of my paper crafting supplies which I put in little plastic bins and tuck inside the drawers. Keeps the space looking clean and organized.;Great addition - Positive, hides supplies - Positive, keeps space clean - Positive, organized - Positive.
great product. I have bought several kallax shelving units over the years. Great quality control and easy to set up.;Great product - Positive, good quality control - Positive, easy to set up - Positive.
Drawers for kallax cube. Easy to assemble, but drawers could be taller. Only 2.5 inches tall.;Easy to assemble - Positive, Drawers could be taller - Negative, 2.
disappointed. I thought these were great and just what I needed and bought several -- only to find that you can only use them on open kallax cubes. you cant use them on cubes where you have doors. So disappointing that Ikea limits you on how you can use them.;Disappointed - Negative, cannot be used on cubes with doors - Negative.
Does its job. Doesn’t exactly bolt on securely;Does its job - Neutral, doesn't bolt on securely - Negative.
Shelving system for organizing. Bought two shelves and set up horizontally to use with bins that keep my space organized. Looks great across the wall!;Organizing shelves - Positive, looks great - Positive.
Elevates the Kallax units. I bought this separately from my Kallax unit because I wasn’t for sure I wanted to use them. But, I should have know how well they would be made coming from Ikea. I got the black for my light wood color Kallax unit. The color contrast is perfect and I can vacuum under it too. I am so happy with my Kallax. I bought 2 units and the feet and the Drona blue inserts. I get so many compliments on this in my scrapbook room. I highly recommend the feet for the perfect combination.;Elevates Kallax units - positive, well-made - positive, black color contrast - positive, receives compliments - positive.
This base is a must have.. I did not want my Kallax unit to sit directly on the floor. This base brings it high enough to sweep under it.;Base for unit - Positive, raises Kallax - Positive, makes cleaning easier - Positive.
Perfect Storage. What else can you say about the perfect storage solution? I bought 2 sets and turned one vertical and one horizontal. I am happy that I bought the feet for them separately. I wanted to make sure I liked them first, so I bought the feet separately in case I wanted to take them back. I got the light brown color and the darker blue inserts. Best storage for my scrapbook room. The 12x12 paper fits perfectly!;Perfect storage - Positive, bought 2 sets - Neutral, turned vertical and horizontal - Neutral, happy with purchase - Positive, bought feet separately - Neutral, light brown color - Neutral, darker blue inserts - Neutral, ideal for 12x12 paper - Positive.
Kallax Bookshelf. Perfect shelf for my craft room. Now I want some drawers and doors to complete the look.;Perfect shelf - Positive, craft room use - Neutral, wants doors and drawers - neutral.
Just right. Great price, right size, low profile makes the books the focus which is the best, holds more than you'd expect;Great price - Positive, Right size - Positive, Low profile - Positive, Holds more than expected - Positive.
Don't buy- you will regret!. We bought two, and 100% disappointed!! Don't buy unless you want to frustrate yourself out!!! We built the first one right after it arrived. Half way through, a major piece, the hole is miss punch! The second one arrived the next day. Until the last step, we noticed the metal part wasn't rectangle!! It was tilted!!  Now, we have two incomplete shelves standing side by side! They don't line up together on even surface!  WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK!!!!! PLEASE RECALL THIS!!! I just read the reviews, and many people have the same situation!! I wished I read the review before purchased this! Can't believe I even paid for shipping to get this over! PLEASE REFUND US!!!!! Ikea, I hope you are reading these reviews! I hope you can refund us and send someone to pick up the furniture! Thanks!;Disappointed - Negative, regret purchase - Negative, major piece inconsistency - Negative, holes not punched properly - Negative, metal part not rectangle - Negative, incomplete shelves - Negative.
Piece in box was wrong - FRUSTRATED. I purchased this last week, deciphered the instruction book and got half way through and noticed that the large piece which is essentially the left frame didn't match the picture. It looked almost like the right side, but it wasn't a duplicate either. IKEA won't send a new piece, so I get to either hike back another hour and exchange or return. Poor product, poor customer service.;P piece in box wrong - Negative, large piece - Neutral, Instruction book - Neutral, IKEA won't send replacement - Negative.
Avoid Like the Plague!. Similar to many other reviews on the FJALLBO, I wish I never left the store with this shelf. Not only did it take a few hours to piece together but multiple parts were defective, including the main frame structure: holes drilled without threads, missing foot piece and no holes or screws to attach to a wall. It's safe to say this unit is a real piece of junk. Worst of all, after speaking with IKEA's USA help team (Twitter) they advised that I either disassemble it and bring it in for an exchange or try and fit the entire unit in my trunk so I can waste even more time dealing with this garbage and building a new one. Hmm, I wonder if the second one will have issues...;Defective parts - Negative, multiple hours assembly - Negative, unsafe to attach to a wall - Negative, poor customer service - Negative.
Why!. I was obsessed with this shelf, but it is HORRIBLE to put together !!!!!! Please do not buy it!!! The parts are all WRONG and it is fustrasting !!! I am so annoyed ! I have been working this shelf for the last 4hrs ! Easy to assemble but the part are off, and the screws are wrong. Warning do not buy!!!!! I love IKEA, but this was a bad choice!;Horrible to put together - Negative, parts incorrect - Negative, frustrating experience - Negative.
Cheap material + damaged in box. I ordered two sets of these drawer inserts and they both arrived damaged! The sides of these inserts are a flexible cardboard material (instead of wood). They arrive flat and are designed to bend along seams in the 4 corners to form a box shape. Both arrived with a seam already ripped/detached, so I cannot assemble them without taping them back together. I am returning them!;Flexible cardboard material - Negative, arrived damaged - Negative.
Drawers don’t use space well.. I bought these for our playroom to help organize all the small toys. Bought these to put all the little figures and the side walls are HALF the size of the front. It’s a total waste of space and they hardly hold anything. Just put a basket in, don’t waste your money on these.;Drawers don't use space well - Negative.
Cute wall Cube. This cube is the perfect size and weight. It looks great on my wall. My biggest complaint is the assembly. I have bought several ikea items which usually don’t have the easiest directions. But this was Horrible. All 4 sides went on easy, but to get the back on took a mallet and lots of patience. I watched several YouTube videos to guide me , unfortunately, the assembly of 5 cubes took days. I had to walk away so my frustration did not lead to damaging the unit.;Size and weight - Positive, looks great on wall - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative.
Very attractive and functional. I like the furniture even better after I received a price adjustment since it went on sale right after we bought it. We added crown molding to the top of each bookcase, was just what they needed. Also added a shelf between the bookcases over the base cabinet, just tied everything together nicely. Love it!;Attractive and functional - Positive, received price adjustment - Positive, added crown molding - Positive, added shelf - Positive.
Beautiful color. Kallax as always, quite utilitarian. But this color my new buy, looks stunning with the baskets shown. Also got other natural baskets/bins. My kitchen/dining has a farmhouse feel in my 1BR apartment. When fixing the smaller panel, doing alone with arthritic hands, had to use rubber/mallet lightly. Even for my fragile hands, left a cookie-crumble crack. They are quite flimsy. However, since this has underframe, I used the felt pads like a honeycomb design to cover the crack. It is best to take a helping hand. This being long top panel, thankfully I did not break the wood plugs. Ikea, pl provide some extra wood plugs for any Kallax . Thanks.; Beautiful color - Positive, Quite utilitarian - Neutral, Stunning with baskets - Positive, Flimsy - Negative, Honeycomb design - Neutral, Best with help - Neutral, Farmhouse feel - Neutral, Replace wood plugs - Suggestion, Provide extra wood plugs - Suggestion.
I like this design. Sturdy looking, I like it. I wish there was more modularity options in height and width. Width is only available in 1 block, 2 or 4. Why not three?;Sturdy looking - Positive, wish for more modularity options - Negative, width only comes in 1, 2, or 4 blocks - Neutral.

Not so fast, not so easy. I agree with some of the previous buyers and wish I had seen them sooner. It was difficult to get my hand and screwdriver in the corners for the upper screws. The holes themselves are weird and it took me multiple times to get them in in general. I'm grateful I didn't buy two like I originally intended. I'm keeping it but won't be purchasing again.;Difficult assembly - Negative, strange hole layout - Negative, kept unit - Neutral, won't purchase again - Negative.
Poor quality. I’m leaving an honest review. This product is very difficult to assemble. You need extremely small hands. The metal used is cheap and bends easily. Overall this is my least favorite ikea product. I do not recommend. It explains why it’s on sale.;Difficult to assemble - Negative, small hands required - Neutral, cheap metal - Negative, bends easily - Negative, least favorite Ikea product - Negative, do not recommend - Negative, on sale - Neutral.
Nice quality but the shelves.... I love this show! It fits perfectly in the space, however, the screws to install the shelves are extremely difficult to reach based on their location and the small size of the screws. I had to finger tighten them for the most part because I could not get a screwdriver in the small shallow space.;Perfect fit - Positive, nice quality - neutral, difficult to install shelves - negative, small shallow space - neutral.
no more clutter. This is so diverse and doesn't take up much floor space. I had some narrow space at the foot of my bed and this fit perfectly. The shelves and drawers are adjustable. My Yoga mat and wrapping paper fit in the drawer and hand weights and the modem in a wood box I bought from Target..I bought 3 of these and they fit perfectly on the bottom shelf: Wood Milk Crate Large by Pillowfort. I only put heavy things on the very bottom and light stuff above. You have to attach it to the wall or it could tip easily!

Great Ravaror bookself. This item is neat and nicely crafted. It was easy to assemble, except for the holes marked for attaching the caster assembly. They had the punch mark, but lacked any pre-drilling, which made it impossible to get the screws to go into the product. Has to make starting pre-drilled holes enough to get the screw to attach properly.  I love the fact it is raised off the floor and easily moved when needed.;Neatly crafted - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive, raised off floor - Positive, easily moved - Positive, issue with caster assembly installation - Negative.

Icing my Forearms. A great little 5 star shelf if someone else puts it together for you. I really wanted to believe the “so easy” reviews and not the “nothing can reach the screw holes” reviews. But alas. I also didn’t expect to spend 30 minutes removing the stickers. Then another 50 or 60 minutes to assemble, between everything sliding around, the 36 short little screws with nothing to grab onto to get them started, frequently dropping the screws and having to fish them out of the groove on the shelf, each screw taking all my weight and effort to coax it along every quarter turn, and all (16) of the top screws being about a millimeter away from the metal grate your knuckles will repeatedly scrape over in the process. I am a seasoned IKEA assembler and this one almost defeated me. I was sweating and hands shaking. I turned so hard the screwdriver bit got stuck in the handle. Agree with reviewer who said wait to tighten the screws at the end. Olive oil helps with the stickers.

Always a great deal. Kallax units are great storage units in all sizes! We use them in my sewing room, where I have the 5x5, 4x4 and 2x2 units, as well as our garage (where my husband customized some individual units). They are versatile and the doors and inserts allow us to tailor the Kallax to our specific needs.;Great deal - Positive, versatile storage units - Positive, tailor to specific needs - Positive, used in sewing room and garage - neutral, available in multiple sizes - Positive.
Wonderful sturdy shelf organizer with flaws. I love how sturdy this piece is and that I can get organized now. It has very clear instructions to put it together. I have owned quite a few IKEA pieces of furniture like this one. The have all been great for a good price and well made. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the “faux wood” stuff that covers the compressed wood underneath. We always use a rubber mallet to hammer in the dowels and hammer the ends of the boards to get them to go in place. This unit had the “faux wood” stuff peeling up very easily and in multiple places. I have never had that happen…ever before. I can only assume that IKEA is using cheaper materials or something which is very disappointing and doesn’t make for the prettiest final product.;"Sturdy shelf - Positive, Clear instructions - Positive, well-made - Positive, disappointment - Negative, ""faux wood"" quality - Negative, peeling up - Negative."
Questionable Quality. Bought these to match one that I’ve had for 5 years. The quality has obviously lessened in the last few years, as these newer ones are more prone to cracking and flaking. Be very careful putting them together. Use soap to help the dowels go in - 80% of the holes were just enough too small that I needed a mallet to put the piece on. Not just a little tap with a hammer. And use a block of wood between the hammer and the shelf. Make the holes a tiny bit bigger!;Questionable quality - Negative, dowels difficult to insert - Negative, smaller holes - Negative.

Great storage option for your Kallax shelf, tho a little fragile. I bought this along with other Kallax storage boxes as a place to keep rolls of paper and interfacing that I use for sewing. It looks great. It works great. My only issue is that I ordered it to be delivered and when it arrived (through the mail), one corner had been slightly dinged up. Not a huge deal since I was able to turn the messed up corner to the back and it's not really visible, but this needs better packing when being shipped. A great option if you can pick it up in store, but a little bit of a gamble if it's shipped to you.;Great storage option - Positive, looks great - Positive, works great - Positive, fragile - Neutitive, slight damage during shipping - Negative.
Nice, but need darker color. I have a black-brown Kallax, and would have liked this insert to match. Since only white was available, I bought it and spray painted it black.

Wonderful piece. I've had this shelving unit in two going on three apartments now. I've used it as an open dresser for clothes in my bedroom, and soon it will be a TV stand in a living room. The clean lines of the design blend in and brighten any room. Even though the drawer mechanism requires a little patience to build, they close cleanly in keeping with this price point or a higher one. I would definitely recommend it. I'm grateful it's so easy to switch out the shelf configuration. As someone mentioned in another review, it's very important to anchor this unit because it's quite tall. Even though it's sturdy you want to make sure to have insurance against weight being distributed in the wrong way. Overall a great-looking, functional piece that would cost much much more if CB2 or West Elm had come up with it.;Wonderful piece - positive, durable - positive, easy to switch out configuration - positive, blends in and brightens rooms - positive, smooth closing drawers - positive, sturdy - positive, value for money - positive, important to anchor - neutral.
Kallax cube units are awesome. I am redoing my craftroom with Kallax cubes and I absolutely love the look and the quality of them.

Great basket. It clips in and locks tight. I use an old expedit wall unit as a headboard, and this basket just made it that much more wonderful. My 15” MacBook Pro fits in quite nicely in it so I have room to put a glass of water and my phone and pills without worrying about any spills.

"Doesn't fit. Obviously I purchased this to get my Kallax up off the floor only to find out that this is longer and wider than my Kallax. My Kallax fits right down between the legs. I have the 8 cube Kallax and looking at the website it shows an 8 cube one sitting on the base. The joke is on me - the base is 58"" and my Kallax is only 51 3/4. I just assumed that the Kallax all had the same size base since it shows the 8 cube sitting on it. With the price of gas, I don't think it is wise to drive 2 hours to return a $20 item.

Perfect low height bookshelf. We had been on the lookout for some bookshelves that would fit below our windows. These were the exact perfect height. We bought two to spam the 8ft windows.

Great Bookshelf. We had been looking for a slightly taller bookshelf to replace our 3 shelf Billy but that wasn't as tall as the 79 version and saw this in the showroom. The color is wonderful and the fact that it is made out of hardwood was such a nice surprise for the price. My only complaint (and it's barely a complaint) is that the middle shelf cannot be adjusted, though I understand why (to help with the stability of the shelf itself). Normally, I don't have any issue with IKEA instructions during assembly but I did have some difficulty figuring out which pieces were which a few times as they're not clear on the instruction pages but once I figured it out, assembly was quick.

Would Not Recommend. This piece is not as easy to put together as some reviews say. Nowhere in the instructions does it say a rubber mallet (or similar) is needed to make sure the pieces fit snugly together.  One review also said the pieces are numbered—no they are not. So I had to take apart one whole shelf because on the last piece the holes and knobs were not the same distance apart and would not fit together.  I was under the impression that some hardware would come with this combination to interlock the 2 shelves together. That's not the case. Also, there are no pilot holes drilled into the bottom of the shelves so I have to figure out how to do that myself.  It would've been cheaper to buy all the pieces separately, and that would've been a better representation of what you're getting yourself into. I'd give it 1 star, but once you wrestle everything together it looks alright.;Not as easy to put together - negative, rubber mallet needed - negative, pieces not numbered - negative, hardware not included - negative, no pilot holes - negative, cheaper to buy separately - neutral.
Not Easy to Assemble. I like the look of this shelving unit, however the assembly process was difficult. The shelving unit isn’t assembled by screws, you have to line them up and it’s a slide-and-lock process. This was challenging and created some scuffs. Just a warning, it’s challenging! I haven’t bought IKEA furniture before, so this was my first experience and I’m a little disappointed in this product.;Not easy assembly - Negative, look of shelving unit - Neutral, slides-and-locks - Negative.
Rip off. This comes in two shelves without a way to attach them that doesn’t cost you extra money you have to put out. It would’ve been cheaper just to buy two of the shelves and put them together;Two shelves - neutral, comes without attachment - negative, extra cost for attachment - negative.
"Terrible. Probably the worst product in IKEA. It is supposed to be easy to install but it's exactly the opposite. This ""hook"" system is absolutely terrible. I will NOT recommend this product.

WORD OF WARNING. I bought this in combination with the EKET Glass doors no. 304.289.01 and the glass doors fell short dimensionally. I miss the days when you could buy Kallax cabinets with glass doors that fit just like their solid cubby doors. (((sigh)));Bought in combination - Neutral, glass doors fell short - Negative, solid cubby doors - Neutral.
Kallax products are great!. I love this product!;Great product - Positive, Love it - Positive.
Works fine but there is room for improvement. 1. I really want to see other color options, matching all colors available for Kallax cubes. 2. I'd also love to see more configurations, because 1 shelf is too generous, and 3 shelves are too tight for my needs (sheet music). May be, pre-drilled inserts with additional shelves sold separately to allow configurations of 1, 2, 3, or 4 shelves at customer discretion. 3. It would be nice if these inserts were compatible with door inserts. And it is definitely overpriced in my opinion.;Works fine - Neutral, color options - negative, more configurations - neutral, overpriced - negative, compatible with door inserts - neutral.
Great addition to shelving unit. These drawer and door insets for the shelving unit are visually appealing, easy to assemble and make organizing real easy.;Great addition - Positive, visually appealing - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, makes organizing easy - Positive.
Not sure how I feel. I thought I had these pieces push all the way in when putting this together so when I out it in my brand new kallax cube, it scratch the white up inside. So disappointing. There should be better instructions. I even used the padding on the edges that came with it but it still scratched the pain and now my shelve has scratch marks on it. I like the divider but not what it did to my new cubes;Received scratched unit - Negative, better instructions needed - negative, divider - neutral, brand new Kallax cube - neutral.

Better Storage In Just Five Minutes. This is - by far - one of the easiest pieces of furniture to assemble you can purchase from IKEA. It will take about five minutes to assemble and give you a ton of options for storing things. Great for organizing any size space. Empty cubbies especially get a seal of approval from my cat.;Easy to assemble - Positive, Takes 5 minutes - Positive, gives a lot of storage options - Positive, great for organizing - Positive, cat approved - Neutral.
Terrible Assembly Instructions!. I just finished assembling eight cubes. The cubes look great in our home office, but the assembly instructions are some of the worst I have ever encountered, and I am a technical writer. It took an hour to assemble the first cube. I had to take it apart once and that was no easy task. Once I figured it out, the remaining seven cubes only took 5 minutes each to assemble. The assembly video makes it look so easy, and it would have been with better instructions. It shows a woman snapping the sides together and then pushing them flush with her hands. Impossible. I used a rubber mallet. My husband couldn't even push them flush with his bare hands. Also, there were several plastic parts included with the cubes, but I couldn't figure out what they were for or how to even install them. I looked for info on the IKEA website but could not find anything. I'm using the cubes without the plasticware, and they seem to be just fine.;Assembly instructions - Negative, cubes look great - Neutral, hour-long assembly - Negative, difficult assembly - Negative, plastic parts - Neutral, couldn't figure out installation - Negative.
Misleading Looks. The product page pictures doesn't follow the directions to the underframe manual. If you follow the directions of the manual, it requires to flip the shelf on its side to install the underframe. One side of the shelf is unpainted and it gets exposed when it's flipped. Also, when the shelf is flipped sideways the little wooden dowels is going to be the main supports to hold items in each slot instead of the solid boards for each layer. The shelf is fine by itself, but addition of the underframe feels like an afterthought by the designer.;Misleading product page - Negative, follows manual to install underframe - Neutral, unpainted side exposed - Neutral, flips on side for installation - Neutral, dowels become main supports - Neutural, feels like afterthought - Neutral.
Best supporting theme. The item fully supports the theme my daughter is creating and allows her creativity to flow.;Supports theme - Positive, allows creativity to flow - Positive.
Raised base for Kallax works great. Adding the raised base to the Kallax units makes them look more like a piece of furniture than a box. It also assists in accessing electric outlets that are located behind the unit. It prevented blocking one of the air vents for the heating system too. The connection system is slick and very easy to do. Two suggestions: if youa re putting the shelf in front of an electric outlet place a power strip in it before attaching to the wall and tuck it under the shelf. And you really need to fasten the shelves to the wall when using the raised base or it will not be stable.;Adds furniture look - Positive, access electric outlets - Positive, prevents heating vent blockage - Positive, easy connection system - Positive, stable with wall attachment - Positive.

As expected.. The Kalyan cube is sturdy and works for storing fabric in my quilt room. It was easy to assemble even for me, a 71 year old female. My daughter had to help me lift it onto a credenza as it was too heavy for me to lift by myself. I have the cube running sideways not standing tall. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.;Expected results - Neutral, sturdy - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, helps to store fabric - Positive, pleased with purchase - Positive.
Perfect piece. This had easy to explain directions, was easy to put together, and it helps me keep organized.;Easy to explain directions - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, keeps organized - Positive.
Update to Questionable Quality review. Ok this big daddy does not want to work out for me. The holes aren’t deep enough for the dowels and can’t be drilled deeper. I’ve had to cut all the dowels down 1/4” inch which is completely absurd. The smaller 8 cube came together easily, but not this 16 cube. I’m literally traumatized. So quality is not questionable anymore but clearly lacking!;Deep enough holes - Negative, required dowel cuts - Negative, Big daddy - Neutral, Quality lacking - Negative.
Great choice for us. We bought the Four high by five across Kallax and 2 two by five Kallaxs for our needs. The small ones can be put together by one person but do need two people to lift on to the base (which we chose to purchase for one of the 4x5 Kallax). The larger Kallax does require two people to put together and to put up on its base (we chose to purchase the base). The second 2x5 Kallax was put on top of the 4x5. Because we have baseboard trim, everything was anchored to the walls. It was great that the wall anchors were included.;Bought Kallax shelves - Neutral, Four high by five - Positive, Two by five - Positive, Wall anchors included - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive, sturdy - Positive, Two people assembly - Neutral, Base purchase - Positive.

I need to contact service to see if I can obtain a shelf.;Purchased 3 - Neutral, Looks great - Positive, unfortunately - Sentiment Neutral, shelf exploded - Negative, need to contact service - Neutral.
. I thought this would be harder to build than it was. My tip on this piece is to have a helper or something to push against when you screw in the main screws. Then do not add the last shelves till you do the other wall with the double screw holes, then flip, add the last two shelves and the last other piece. I love this piece so much I am considering to get two more to place on both sides of the fire place.;Easier to build than expected - positive, main screws assembly helper - neutral, double screw holes - neutral, considering getting more - positive.
Surprising use…. We purchased this for my daughter’s dorm room… as a bedside table next to bunk beds!

would love this size in the glossy gray or true black. One star because of limited color options.   My wife & I bought & love the glossy gray 2x4 version (bought used over a year ago because it's always out-of-stock whenever we try to buy it - even today) but we use it for a growing vinyl collection that will eventually need more shelving. We would highly prefer the glossy gray or at least true black to better match our existing color scheming.

Cost reduced Expedit... misleading presentation. I have this 4-cubby piece in EXPEDIT, bought a few years ago. It worked really nicely as a warm, textured catch-all in our open entrance. So when we needed to extend the storage space, I did not think twice about buying another one. Not remembering the original name, I saw this and bought it in the black-brown color. It is not the same -- not even a bit. The chunky edges are no more, the warm dark wood is similarly named (black-brown), but now it's a wood-textured black -- no brown detectable. What was mis-leading was that in the store, they still showed an Expedit piece, warm brown color which turns out does not exist in Kallas. So I brought home the boxes... What a mistake... The piece measurements are the same on paper, but the actual measurements are smaller. Whereas the original Expedit had personality and warmth, this could well live in a conference room and nobody would bat an eye. Not quite 1 star, because the functions are ok -- I do like the drawers, even if they have shallow sides (1/2 of the door heights) and flimsy hardware (plastic tightening screws, and nuts). I would definitely have bought a different color had I realized this was different. Now where can I find an Expedit cubby?;Original Expedit - positive, mismatched product - negative, warm and textured - positive, incorrect product presentation - negative, shallow drawers - neutral, flimsy hardware - negative, functions ok - neutral, desirable color - positive, no longer available - neutral.
Bring back the old. I do not like this new insert at all. Bring back the old version that could be pulled out and relocated as modular furniture should allow.

Poor assembly.

Kallax for home office and living room. I purchased three Kallax 3x4 units...two for my husband's home office storage and the third for the living room. I love the look of the cubes and they are very sturdy.

Horrible and disappointing design. I've been putting together Ikea furniture for 20+ years. I saw a picture of the mitered edges with the keyhole fasteners before purchasing and thought to myself that this will work great or not at all. Unfortunately, it was the latter. The holes were not cleanly drilled so the boards did not slot together without significant force (even before I tried to get the last piece on). When I tried to take it apart, because I couldn't get the last piece on, it was impossible. Would not recommend ANY Ikea product with this new construction.;Mitered edges - Negative, Disappointing design - Negative, Keyhole fasteners - Negative, Holes not cleanly drilled - Negative, Boards do not fit without force - Negative, Impossible to take apart - Negative, New construction - Negative.

FANTASTIC for storing Vinyl Records!. I had found another product to store vinyl records that was almost 3x the cost but it was backordered and I'm glad it was. This is so much nicer for a fraction of the cost. The construction is more solid and the stand makes it look alot more expensive then it is. It wasn't difficult to put together and is holding his 500+ album collection beautifully.

Long time favorite…but. Our family has loved these shelves, we all have them in our homes, some have been passed down over time. Over the years we bought the Kallax’s predecessor (name currently escapes me). We were skeptical about the change to the Kallax but still tried them and found them to work. However, the nature of the Kallax has changed and I’m not sure it is for the better. Our older shelves were strong and heavy and survived several moves quite well. But these new ones are as light as if they were made from spun sugar and feel rather insubstantial, as if they are purposely made not to last. It was quite a surprise as it has only been a few months since we bought others so the change seems quite recent. Time will tell but I doubt we will buy any more.;Long-time favorite - Positive, loved by family - Positive, passed down - Neutral, old model design - neutral, skeptical about Kallax - Neutral, lightweight and insubstantial - Negative, not built to last - Negative.

The dim. Changed compared to my old Kallax.

Good value. At ordered two of these for the kids playroom, to help conceal the unsightly amount of random toys! I had to pick them up from an associated delivery center (for a very reasonable fee).

Previous version is much better. I had a couple of these series (2X4) of shelf at home.

Major problem. Received this not two hours ago. Unpacked and started assembling. There are printing marks all over the face of at least one of the drawers. I am not able to return it as I have no way to get it there, and even if I could drive 40 miles to do so, I have no time. No matter how much I like Ikea, I have to give this one the lowest rating possible. First time Ikea's let me down. The ratings below apply to this individual piece I purchased, NOT to the line, as a whole. I really do like Kallax -- just not this eyesore I'm stuck with. Yes, the product WORKS as expected.

Love this little shelf!. This is one of my favorite shelves. I bought one and found it very easy to put together so I went back to buy a few more.

Handy rolling storage. Moderately easy to put together, solid considering the materials, rolls well. I bought it to store documents and files as it was much less expensive than a filing cabinet.

For the price it's good.. These are really cute. They're pretty sturdy. They should be simple enough to put together but they are a pain. The position of the screws is so difficult. Definitely put strains on your hands. And it didn't even come with a screwdriver that fit so I had to find one. Also on mine I Have the warning stickers on my poles and I can't get them off.

Good shelf - terrible assembly. It took me two hours to get this together. It is very difficult screwing the screws in - which is basically the entire assembly process.

The Billy Bookcases are better. I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. Online it said they were in stock. Even at the store it said they were in stock, but they weren't. Since I do not live close to the store, I did not want to waste my trip and so I settled for buying the Kallax bookcases instead. I bought 4 of them, all different sizes. I was very disappointed.   Regardless of size they are held together with 8 screws and wooden dowls. The wooden dowls do not fit well into the holes. Since they are a few inches long but thin, a few of them broke. Luckily I have tools and my own dowl jig so I drilled them out, widened the holes and used bigger dowls.  I also had to use a rubber mallet to tap the dowls fully into the holes. I then had to also use the mallet to tap everything together because I could not push everything together snuggly and I'm pretty big.   I eventually got everything together but it was a lot more work than it needed to be. They can either use thicker dowls and/or drill their holes ever so slightly bigger so everything will fit together easily.   I never had these problems when assembling their Billy bookcases of which I have 12 or 13 of.;Disappointed with product - Negative, Held together with screws and dowels - Neutral, Woods dowels do not fit well - Negative, Some dowels broke - Negative, Required extra tools - Negative, Assembly process difficult - Negative.

Storage unit is good. My daughter's room smells like a funeral and has for many days due to the formaldehyde off-gassing. Legally it can have formaldehyde as it is not labelled as children's furniture. Also, I had this delivered and had two #2 boxes delivered instead of a #1 & #2. After approximately 5 hours waiting on the phone and being transferred around (yes, really) the girl completely messed it up again so I ended up driving to an Ikea location to fix it. So I paid $50 for delivery for nothing, wasted many hours and had no apology. I was and continue to be kind as I have worked in retail and know how it is. I would very much consider this information however if you have no vehicle and are hours from a location.;Off-gassing issue - Negative, formaldehyde present - Negative, delayed delivery - Neutral, long hold time on phone - negative, apology absent - Negative, product assembly required - Neutral.

NIGHTMARE to assemble, total garbage. I've been assembling Ikea furniture for over 30 years for both my home and businesses and I have never encountered such a frustrating build!! I always read Ikea assembly instructions thoroughly but no matter how carefully I followed them, it was a disaster. A total loss for me as the thing was so shreaded beyond functionality just from trying to put it together that it went into the garbage because my nearest Ikea store is over 2 hours away to return its pathetic scraps.

These are awful. If you ever purchased an older version of this you will hate this new version. You have to screw these into the shelving structure, so once they are there, they aren't moving unless you want to see all of the holes left behind. Being able to change how you used these in the old version was a great feature (especially if you move a lot). The older version had deeper drawers and were quite substantial. I am very disappointing in this new version. Quality is very low and it is not easy to install.;Awful - Negative, older version feature - Positive, shallow drawers - Negative, difficult installation - Negative, poor quality - Negative.
The drawers are REALLY shallow. This looks like it contains two drawers that each take up roughly half the space in one cube of the Kallax shelf. WRONG - it has two fronts that each take up half the space. The sides of the drawers are roughly half as high as the front of the drawer. So, you can only store about 3 worth of stuff in each drawer. What's the point?;Shallow drawers - Negative, roughly half the space - Negative, contain two fronts - Neutral, half as high as front - Negative.
I loved it so much I bought a second one!. I purchased the 25 cube Kallax with 6 inserts about 6 months ago for my foyer. I love it and admire it every time I walk by it. It’s big, it’s organized, and it is very beautiful. The pictures don’t compare to it in person. I had been recently looking online for a piece for my bedroom. So I purchased the 25 cube Kallax with 10 inserts this time and it’s perfect for us. I am thinking about getting one for my son’s room as well. Both pieces have been worth every penny spent!;Loved it - Positive, purchased 2 - Neutral, big - neutral, organized - positive, beautiful - Positive, worth every penny - Positive.

Great Features and Use of Space. I recently purchased four white cubes. They have been a great use of space. They are very sturdy and hold hard backed books.;Great use of space - Positive, sturdy - Positive, holds hard backed books - Positive.
. Used these to create a couple of wall-mounted “floating” nightstands. Very easy to assemble. The wall attachment rails (purchased separately) make it easy to install. Just be sure to use appropriate mounting hardware that can support 30lbs or more. Not sure I would use it for anything too heavy, but works for supporting a few books and bedside light.;Easy assembly - Positive, Wall attachment rails - Positive, Holds 30lbs or more - neutral.
Holes wrong size. The predrilled holes all seemed to be the wrong size. We broke 2 wooden dowels trying to fit them in the holes before we decided to return it. So the halves of the wooden dowels are just permanently stuck in there. And we had to keep pounding on them because when we put the little shelves into the big shelves, they wouldn’t sit flush against the big shelves because the dowels were sticking out too far. So I’m going to get the Better Homes and Gardens version I stead which I had a far easier time putting together. The instructions make more sense on BHG too.;Wrongly sized holes - Negative, broke wooden dowels - Negative, difficult assembly instructions - Negative, getting BHG version instead - Neutral.
Weird. Bought this item to separate paperwork. It attaches weird & creates a space issue at the top. Lose more space than you gain. It's not practical but it's pretty.;Creates space issue - Negative, not practical - Negative, pretty - Positive.
Used to LOVE them. I just picked up 3 KALLAX two cubbie by two cubbie storage shelves. I have a whole craft room done in these storage units and I loved them so I went back for a couple more. This batch is AWFUL. The screw holes don't align. I had to sit on them to push them into place so I could screw them together. 1 shelf used to take about 15 mins for me to assemble, now more like 40 mins of wrestling the piece into submission so I can get it together. UNFORTUNATE!;Loved previous shelves - Positive, awful quality - Negative, misaligned screw holes - Negative, assembly time longer - Negative.
Soft dowels snapped off. The kallax unit looks great, but was difficult to assemble due to the breaking dowels. The holes are machined tight, and the dowels are soft - 4 dowels snapped in assembly. Why not throw in a couple extra dowels?;Good looking unit - Positive, Difficult to assemble - Negative, Breaking dowels - Negative, Machined tight holes - Neutral, Few extra dowels - Suggestion.
Broken. I bought 2 of these and unfortunately the edge was cracked and split on one of them. Also I have bought several in past, not same quality.;Bought 2 - Neutral, Cracked and split - Negative, Not same quality - Negative.
Solid classic, was not disappointed. There's a reason Ikea has sold Kallax for so long. It's sturdy and can be used in so many ways. This one is going in a bedroom to organize craft items. I expect to have this piece for the foreseeable future.  Side note: I bought Kallax in black for my living room earlier this year. A 4x4 with a 2x4 stacked on top, holding about 2000 books. Obviously very happy with my purchase.;Classic design - Positive, not disappointed - Positive, sturdy - Positive, versatile - Positive, organizing craft items - Neutral, foreseeable future - Positive, previous purchase - Positive.

Kallax. So sad not to have my Expedit as an option. These are ok but the others were far superior (I had them over a decade and 3 major moves). My recommendation is based sadly on the fact that there is no longer the previous version. Less sturdy at a higher price. Like the appearance with the wider edge of the Expedit.;Previous version not available - Negative, Appearance - Neutral, Less sturdy - Negative, Higher price - Negative.
Good & long-lasting but needs better options.. We still have one bought back in 2005!!! That's over 12 years and no peeling or breakages despite it has been holding quite a number of books and the overall weight was rather hefty (although we did put the heaviest at the bottom and lightest at the top). We recently purchased a second unit with the intention to put it on wheels. If you think about doing the same, I would not go that route unless you plan to use it only for lightweight items, not books. Even with 1/2 the books it could hold per square, the whole structure would be far too heavy to use the wheels provided by Ikea.  We actually added solid wood strips some 5 inches wide running front to back at the bottom and stained them in a dark color. The strip have been attached with screws on the frame of the bottom plank (the center of the base is hollow). Those served as support for the wheels which added separately as they had a higher load rating (still ikea ones), but even then the solution wasn't a viable option because the unit became too flimsy feeling when under load and would be unreliable for use with heavy items. So the books went back to the old unit which we had to keep stationary and not add any wheels. And this one will be used as a movable partition for storage of lightweight items while providing some privacy on the other side of it. The plan was to use 2 of these but we had to change solution. Also during the test under load, the wheel left some scoring in our hardwood floor (apparently much less hard than the plastic of the wheels) so that was a complete deal breaker even if the unit would have reveal itself to be more stable when moved around. One aspect in which I wish the design would have been revised is to see the gaps that always form in the middle that is large enough to show the dowels which are supposed to connect the vertical square panels to the top closing plank. A 3rd screw might also help make the frame a bit more rigid. Mind you that we have not clued anything together to be able to disassemble as needed... so with that considered it's still a pretty sturdy construction given its price point and overall quality construction. We haven't needed to use the anchoring (we also have no kids or pets in the house), but we'd recommend it if you live in areas with seismic activity or have kids and pets, even if you don't load the unit all that much. I wish it had better options (like a set of 8 softer and high-load carrying wheels) as well as a better design for the insert with door, which ends up having a very poor fit in many cases and will need to be heavily tweaked making it the more time intensive assembling task... they should be redesigned and changed to a thin frame holding the swinging panel door with small pins acting as stops to prevent the door from traveling inwards more than it should. The back plate could be much the same as long as machining will be kept as precise as possible. That said, if you use this as simple shelving unit to hold some books and display small object, it will serve you for years if not decades to come.;Long-lasting - Positive, sturdy - Positive, durable - Positive, needs better wheel options - Negative, holds heavy items - Positive, poor door fit - Negative, well-constructed - Positive, recommended for heavy use - Positive.
Nearly perfect shelving unit. Firstly, I love my Kallax shelf unit. It works perfectly as a room divider for a small apartment and looks great overall. Definitely need at least two people to assemble, if only for the part where you sit the shelving unit right side up. I would give it five stars, however, multiple pieces arrived damaged (paint chipped off, multiple ~2 in gouges in the particle board). I'm sure Ikea would have replaced the damaged parts, but I was already at my wit's end after trying to return another item over the course of four weeks.;Perfectly works as room divider - Positive, easy assembly with help - neutral, love overall look - Positive, received damaged pieces - negative.
Kallax. It is the perfect size and storage for our guest room. IKEA has great storage options!;Perfect size - Positive, storage solution - Positive, great storage options - Positive.
Nice Looking. The shelf itself is very nice and looks great. However, putting it together is a different story. There are no words in the directions--just diagrams. So if you have a hard time following diagrams you may want to think twice about purchasing. Advice to the purchaser: You will need at least two people to assemble this shelf, and you may argue during the process. Hopefully the two of you will get along.  Also, there are extra holes and have no idea what those holes are for. Advice to the company: In the future if you are not planning to use words in your directions it would be beneficial to the purchaser to at least label the the parts.;Nice looking shelf - Positive, difficult assembly process - Neutral, no clear instructions - Negative, requires two people - Neutral, extra holes - Neutral.

No replacement shelf. This could have been a good product. one of the interior shelves broke. Called Ikea, and they said they cannot replace it UNLESS you kept your receipt.  Seriously ? I'm willing to pay for the shelf, but you can't even do that unless you have a receipt. Ikea products are decent, but their service is such that you have to buy an entirely new unit, or keep the receipts for the entire life of the product. I'm sorry, but this really stinks Ikea.;No replacement shelf - Negative, interior shelf broke - Negative, called Ikea - Neutral, unable to replace it without receipt - Negative.

Good but could be better. I didn't realize this isn't one shelf, rather its two shelves and there is no way to connect them to prevent a gap from showing when they're placed next to each other.

. We bought this shelf unit as a cubby shelf for my daughter's playroom. I saw it online but wanted to see it in person before I purchased. Unit was better than I had expected.  Heavy duty metal material frame and shelves far exceed similar shelves at big box stores. Parts and assembly make the shelves super durable and the unit came with complimentary wall anchors to keep the shelf stable and upright -- not that they were necessary for us since the unit was pretty level and stable already. We have used the snap-and-lock storage bins from Walmart to store various toys and games on this shelf, rather like a large cubby shelf. It has been an amazing addition to the playroom and I'm so glad I made the purchase.  We've had this shelf for over 3 years now. We have moved and rearranged rooms and still this shelf looks as good as the day we bought it. Shame there isn't a way to include a pic with this review!

A little dissappointed. We love IKEA and have a number of shelving solutions from them but this one is a bit of a disappointment. Inconsistencies in the manufacture of the Kallax unit caused it to go together slightly out of square, with some gaps in the panels and misalignment of the face of the shelving.

Great piece, one small recommendation for improvement. This was surpisingly easy to put together, feels pretty sturdy, holds a lot and seems a really good value for the price. I got this with two sets of drawers which gives it a nice combination of hidden storage and open shelving. It wasn't obvious to me from looking at it online but you can set the shelves at different heights which is a plus.

So sturdy. We got this to use as storage for our kids clothes. We were shocked with how thick the wood is. It is so sturdy and we don’t worry about the kids breaking a shelf.

Dowels/holes not a proper fit. We were very disappointed in this after easy assembly of the micke desk and malm dresser. Either the dowels were too long for one side or the holes weren’t drilled out properly, and it took entirely too long to put this together.

Easy to install, but some caveats. It was easy to install and adjust these, and the hinges seem to be quality. If installing these in the top corner slots, be aware that they block access to the wall anchor brackets, so you have to anchor the unit to the wall first.  If I ever have to temporarily remove them, for example to access the wall anchor points when moving the unit, I would worry about the self-tapping screws stripping their holes during reinstallation because they have to go into the thin surface material of the Kallax unit.;Easy installation - Positive, quality hinges - Positive, top corner installation caveat - neutral, blocking access to wall anchor brackets - neutral, self-tapping screws worry - Negative.

Before you buy it, do this. Go to the store and look at the display units, specifically the doors. Chances are the door on the right hangs down a quarter inch lower than the other one. Not knowing this, I purchased this unit and spent about an hour assembling it, only to find that the doors do not line up. If you are okay with the doors looking broken because one hangs down, then this is a nice looking piece. I am giving it one star though because of all my wasted time, which includes assembling it, disassembling it, and waiting in line a half hour to return it. If you read the reviews, you will see other people saying the exact same thing. The problem with the doors goes back over a year, and apparently is fine by Ikea.

A little underwhelming. I really love IKEA products and I have a lot of IKEA items in my home. I waited almost two years to get this Kallax 5x5 with 10 inserts, due to supply issues during the pandemic. So I was very excited when it was delivered. Assembly was a bit more difficult than I have found with other furniture I have put together. Some of the holes did not line up. One of the inserts was very damaged. The piece that is screwed into the cabinet is supposed to be all one piece that folds to fit into the cabinet. The damaged insert was broken into three pieces.

"Love it, but it's better if you assemble it ""wrong"". Major upgrade to our kallax that we had been using as a TV stand! However, I did not like adding the bracket to the outside of the shelf, so I flipped it, still on the same bolt, but I put the bracket in the seam where the bottom board and side come together. It makes a little gap but in my opinion looks much better than a bracket on the outside. I was able to reduce the gap by adding a little counter sink to the inside side of the hole just using a pocket knife.

"It is good so far, but took me 3 weeks to put together.. Customer service needs a little help. Apparently, no one knows that this particular product has the only 3x3 shelves with four holes on a single shelf.   I had a misaligned shelf while I was putting it together, and the dowels went through the side. I drove to Ikea to get a single replacement shelf.   They sent me home with a shelf with only two holes on each side. I called customer service, and they said they would send me a replacement. They sent the outside support, not a single shelf.   I called customer service and told them that maybe the third time was the charm. I found someone who walked me to the correct page in the product instructions and told her exactly what piece I needed. She told me she was writing notes and then never sent the board.   I called a week later to follow up, and they did not indicate someone sending anything. So I had to drive to IKEA— half an hour's drive, about an hour for them to make me the right piece—go home another 1/2 hour.   They don't want to replace the shelves; I would have paid for the correct piece. It was my error. But no one knew they didn't even have them to replace them.   Number all the parts. I would pay a nominal fee to replace something I broke instead of dumping the whole thing in the trash because you want to sell more products.   This is an environmental issue. They are inexpensive, to begin with. A bit more environmentally friendly would be to help you repair what you have rather than toss the whole thing and force someone to repurchase it or buy something different from someone more expensive.";Three weeks to assemble - Negative, customer service - Neutral, misaligned shelf - Negative, replacement issue - Negative, need correct part numbered - Neutral, environmental issue - Neutral.

Pretty good, overall.. It's not as hard to put together as some here seem to suggest, there are a lot of screws to tighten, so a small electric screwdriver might save you some grief. About 1.5 hours at a leisurely pace to assemble, with hand tightening. Every connection is secured with a screw, no snap fit or glued parts. I was worried there might be warpage or misalignment with the steel structure, but it came out surprisingly straight and sturdy. One of the inner wooden shelves was a slight tight fit and took some pressure to squeeze in, I didn't notice any bowing of the frame or the shelf, but I'll probably sand it slightly just in case. I noticed the wood screws slipped when tightening about 3/4 the time, so I'd suggest going easy on tightening once you feel the resistance increasing. In any case, they offer sufficient support to anchor the wood well onto the frame. I wish the wood was slightly thicker and substantial, but it's not flimsy either. I don't know how it would hold up to moisture, but it does have a finish on it.;Pretty good - neutral, not hard to assemble - neutral, small electric screwdriver recommendation - neutral, 1.

Expect defects. Purchased July 2017, and the product was defective and damaged. Damaged part: One of the connecting posts that's supposed to slide into a connecting hole was busted and manufactured at an angle so that it could not enter in the connecting bit. I ended up taking a hammer to straighten the piece out, which luckily did the trick. Defective part: One of the long posts was not produced with the correct bottom. The bottom side of the posts have a place to screw in a piece, but one of my posts had two top sides, so the whole shelf is lopsided. I also ran into a lot of issues assembling this shelf.

Great idea & assembled easily. Recently moved and could no longer fit a nightstand so I got these and use the end of my kallax bookshelf next to the bed now. Works great.

A decent shelving unit. I bought one of these to compliment an office setup. These shelf ares definitely hold a lot of items and you could put electronics inside since it has cutouts for cables.

Looks good, but some construction issues. This is a very nice shelving unit, and just the size I needed. There were, however, some issues putting it together. The wooden pegs for the shelving were the right size for the internal shelves, but too long for the frame. I now have small gaps between the shelves and the frame, which has affected the smooth running of the drawers I purchased. The drawers and doors I bought were very easy to put together, though I had to adjust the screw positions when attaching their frames as the screws on one side of the partitions hit the screws on the other side.

The Kallax 4 x 4 is an attractive answer to storage, display. My wife and I put it together in an hour or two. Instructions were clear. It is a two person job I think especially when righting the structure for its final phases.

Look for the tiny 1. Like many others I got this shelf to store records as it’s a fantastic size, and like many others I had a horrible time putting this together. I needed to use a hammer on a towel to get the pieces to align, only to discover on the last step that I hadn’t started with the board marked with a tiny “1”. I tried everything to try and get it to work without taking it apart, but in the end I had to start over. Not only is the notch for the backboard deeper in the 1 panel, but the holes for the center boards are spaced differently and there is nothing in the instructions warning you about that. I got it together on the 2nd try but the whole process took a toll and the shelf is banged up. So look for the panel marked with a tiny 1 the same color as the paint - probably making it a bright yellow sticker would be smarter, Ikea - check the alignment with the center pieces as you go - I’m not sure why the holes would be spaced differently, but it seems like another oversight - and grab a hammer;"Fantastic size - Neutral, horrible time assembling - Negative, used a hammer - Negative, marked with a tiny ""1"" - Neutive, check alignment - Neutral, center pieces have differently spaced holes - Negative."

Perfect!. Eight pieces down, and two to go. I’ve been designing a second sewing room using different sizes of Kallax in the room and the closet.

As usual, great IKEA product. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the instructions said I needed a hammer. You really need a rubber mallet and NOT a hammer.  A hammer would have damaged the product.  Also, the package did not include the stickers to cover the exposed screws.  This is very annoying because you have to make another trip to IKEA just to get those.;Great IKEA product - Positive, instructions call for hammer - Negative, hammer damage risk - Negative, did not include stickers - Negative.
Push together. We luv the unit. Bought for my daughter who has the 16 cube unit that we soon realized needed the 25 cube unit. It fits well in her room. The only thing I say is that these units need to come with a rubber mallet because it’s some what hard to push the wood pins together n u don’t want to use a hammer because it can leave dents.;Fits well in room - Positive, requires rubber mallet for assembly - Negative.
Very good product for value. This is a great product for storage. I got the feet, too, and it elevates it. I'm not going to lie, it's a challenge to put together yourself and some of the pegs really need tapping in or you cannot get it together, but overall super value for the price.

Nice finish, but .... installation issues.... Easy to assemble and nicely finished, the shelf's design suffers from its inability to sit flush against a wall because of the baseboard. Without hiring an expensive cabinet maker, the shelf just floats. And the wall hooks are simply inane. I bought four which I will keep because returning is a nightmare.

Would not recommend for vinyl storage with outer sleeves. I bought this based on other reviews stating they used this for vinyl storage. If you archive your vinyl in outer sleeves, then I would not recommend this unit. Bare vinyl covers just barely clear the opening and not all of my vinyl covers fit. I previously bought the 4 cube EKET and that works perfectly. About a 1/2 inch of clearance above vinyl covers giving plenty of extra room. I didn't have enough room for another 4 cube EKET, so I went for 2 single cubes and these do not have the same interior dimensions. I knew this going in, but since others were using it for vinyl, I figured I would be good. I'll make due with it because I need the extra storage, but if you have the space, definitely go for the 4 cube unit.;Not recommended for vinyl storage with outer sleeves - Negative, fit issues with vinyl covers - Negative, workaround due to lack of storage alternatives - Neutter, 4 cube unit alternative - Positive.

EKET Shelf. I assembled four shelves and joined them together. The end product is functional and beautiful, but I had the most difficult time in the assembly process. The back board that slides into place was about an eighth of an inch too tall which made assembly impossible. I finally used an exacto knife and scored it on both sides to remove this extra height. Once I did that, it went together perfectly. It seems the back board was not cut properly. Once I figured out what I had to do, I assembled the remaining EKETS easily. It was extremely frustrating that the piece was cut incorrectly.;Functional and beautiful - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative, back board not cut properly - Negative.

The square beyond compare!. Let’s start with price: for the functional utility of this unit it can’t be beat. We already had the 12 square unit, which I used for stacking t-shirts and clothing and quickly outgrew. An upgrade to the 16 square unit was a no-brainer and has allowed me much needed storage space that would have otherwise clinically classified my t-shirt buying hobby as hoarding. Truth be told, my wife was sick of me stacking shirts around the room, on the top of dressers and night stands, that something had to give. To say I really needed this item is an understatement. As with most IKEA products there was a little assembly required that I initially dreaded since I didn’t help with the construction of the 12 square unit and therefore didn’t know what to expect. With a little guidance and temperance from my wife, we had it put together in less than an hour.;Functional utility - Positive, can't be beat - Positive, outgrew 12 square unit - Neutive, needed storage space - Positive, easy assembly - Positive.

The quality is great for what we’ll be needing it for, which is to store office supplies, craft supplies, etc. We purchased a few of the baskets that slide in to the squares, along with one divider for reams of paper. We are very happy with the end result, and highly recommend this product.;Easy assembly - Positive, Quality is great - Positive, purchased baskets and divider - Neutral, stores office and craft supplies - Neutral, highly recommend - Positive.

For the price, I had hoped for better.. We bought the Kallax, plus some drawers and doors. After carefully putting it all together, one of the drawers catches on some mechanism when you pull it out and the doors don't hang perfectly.

Love my Kallax system. I love this Kallax piece. This is what has sold me on IKEA furniture. I placed it in my craft room and had it full in no time. I love that I can group my craft items by section. So, all the scrapbooking materials are grouped together. My puzzles are another group. Painting supplies are together. I have tried to organize before with other organizing units, and it just didn't work. Things were cheaply made and hid my items. With this unit, I am able to see what I have and keep things organized. This is a sturdy system.  I was worried that the shelves would not hold the weight of my items. A year in and all is well. I also love that I can add more Kallax organizers to this unit for my expanding craft supplies. In fact, I purchased a 12 cube to go beside it. Finally, I can't forget to mention all the accessories to go in the cubes. The drawers, shelves, bottle holder. I am able to customize so it works for me. I kick myself that I didn't buy this sooner and save money.;Love Kallax - Positive, sturdy system - Positive, holds weight - Positive, customizable - Positive, able to expand - Positive.

Good Quality. Pros: Quality pieces, looks great, fits large baskets for organization, comes in a box that is easy to transport compared to a lot of furniture  Cons: Difficult to put together (be sure to pay attention to the pictures and which side faces up - it didn’t highlight this in the very first step, and I ended up having to take it apart and put it back together because the holes needed to face a certain way so that it lined up in the end to put the final small decorative pieces under the shelves in the front), no predrilled holes in the wood (they provide screws with a point and say that you need a tool to start the hole along with screwdriver to put the screws in - I just used a drill, which worked great) and no markings to line up exactly where to drill into the wood to make sure that it stays centered nicely, very lightweight so you’ll likely have to anchor it to the wall even if you don’t intend to or it will probably be too unstable;Quality pieces - Positive, Looks great - Positive, Fits large baskets - Positive, Easy to transport - Positive, Difficult to assemble - Negative, No predrilled holes - Neutral, Lightweight - Neutral, Requires anchoring to wall - Neutral.

Versatile, well-designed, sturdy. We bought two 4x4 Kallaxes for our family room to use a bookcases and grandchild toy storage. The variety of storage boxes makes the latter easy, and the 13” cubbies hold large books. Assembly was easy, but is best done with a helper. The components fit perfectly and securely.

just okay. I had the larger version in black for years and absolutely loved it, but the high gloss white leaves me feeling just meh... it's just laminate over particle board, which makes it somewhat difficult to assemble.

So much storage for a great price. I've had this shelf up for 2 weeks now, and it looks fantastic. The assembly was not as smooth as other Ikea furniture I've put together, but I was able to do it with one other person without breaking any parts or getting injured. A lot of elbow grease is required. Also, I recommend using heavy duty snap toggle anchors if you're going to secure the shelf into drywall. The unit itself is crisp looking (though mine was dented on a side and I didn't notice until getting home) and quite versatile in terms of how you choose to dress it up.

Perfect for my records. I bought three of these to hang on the wall in a custom arrangement to hold records. The pieces all snap together, but don't feel like they're going to fall apart (which is important since they're holding vinyl). Even with an extra hardware store run to get wall anchors, all three were assembled and hung on the wall in under 2 hours. I do have a few records that are in slightly taller gatefold cases or in their own box that were a tighter fit, but not unmanageable.;Snap together design - Positive, Holds records well - Positive, Quick assembly - Positive, Wall hung - Neutral, Slightly tight fit for larger cases - Neutral.

"Easily built, sturdy, and flexible use. I needed some extra storage space, and IKEA just happened to have a sale on for Kallax shelving. The second toughest part was probably deciding which one to get; the first was trying to move the superdense box (:D). But seriously, the different possible combinations of shelves (I almost got the 3x3 instead) and the treatments for the compartments (fabric or wicker baskets, drawers or cabinet doors, etc.?) makes them suitable for most any situation. I told my sister-in-law about the sale, and she drove down to pick up several. Whereas I needed the shelves for extra clothing in the bedroom, she wanted to improve her craft room storage.

Assembly is quick and easy. Just wanted to make a review addressing all the one star reviews. This box is super simple to build. If you can slide pieces together, you can build this box. It does require some common building sense. Rubber mallet is helpful but not necessary, as you can just use your weight to get the pieces to slide together. I've bought 12 of these, and only had one issue where one of the plastic connectors on a panel was not fully driven in, few wacks of the rubber mallet took care of it.;Quick assembly - Positive, easy build - Positive, common building sense required - Neutral, no necessity of rubber mallet - Neutral, had one issue - Neutral.

Bad Quality and Service. Really, had to do this review thing twice. It's ridiculous!Got the same unit before and noticed the material has degraded so much during installation.

Love it. We bought 2 of them for our office.  We modified them by adding stained wood to the outsides of them, but even without the additional modifications we did on our own, they are very sturdy and heavy duty. We purchased the extra drawers, doors, and casters and are very happy with how it provides stylish storage.

Not recommended.. I own many Ikea products, and I am delighted with most of them. This particular item seems to be of lower quality than I have experienced with other Ikea pieces. The parts didn't line up as well as I have experienced in the past with other items. The worst part is the chemical smell. It smells like burning plastic. My throat was pretty irritated after assembling, but I figured that the smell would dissipate after a little while. Well, it's been two days, and I just finished moving both Kallax units to the backyard to get the smell out of the house. Hopefully, they will off-gas enough outdoors for me to bring them back inside. Otherwise, I will be returning these shelves.;Lower quality parts - Negative, chemical smell - Negative, burning plastic - Negative, irritated throat - Negative.

Poor installation instructions.. First, do not use a claw hammer as illustrated in the installation guide. Use a rubber mallet will help protect the wooden pegs and edges of the shelves (when you have to tap the ends with 4 pegs. Horizontal shelves do not slide in like the illustration.  You have to tap hard to get them flush.  Second major problem is that there 3 different width to the interior shelves, and vertical and horizontal perimeter pieces. This makes it difficult to align the pegs with the holes when everything is laying flat (as recommended by the installation guide). You have to lift certain pieces off the floor by about 1/8 in order to match the holes with the pegs. Probably not so bad with smaller units such as 2 x 4, but it gets very heavy try to lift the pieces when you are almost done with the 5 x 5 unit. A word of caution. Once assembled the 5 x 5 unit, it is nearly impossible to move the unit because it is so darn heavy.  You literally have to dissemble everything if you were to move the unit to another location. There is no shear panel, so the unit will flex if you attempt to move it too far. Probably a better idea is two smaller units rather than one large unit such as the 5 x 5,;Poor installation instructions - negative, do not use claw hammer - neutral, use rubber mallet - neutral, horizontal shelves do not slide in easily - negative, different widths of interior shelves - negative, difficult to align pegs with holes - negative, heavy unit - negative, nearly impossible to move - negative.
Just what we needed for a tiny bedroom. A beach house we manage has a tiny master bedroom, in which a huge old dresser occupied most of the floor space AND blocked the baseboard heater to boot. For about $200 we added three times as much usable storage space with the 8-section Kallax, adding doors and drawers to all 8 sections, and boosting it up off the floor and OVER the baseboard heater with Godmorgen feet. The room is so much more navigable, the heat now circulates freely, and there's room for a whole summer's worth of easily-accessible clothes. Took a little extra work, but it's a world of difference.;Small bedroom solution - Positive, adds storage - Positive, usable space increased - Positive, fits over heater - Positive, customizable (doors and drawers) - Positive.

Nice Piece for lots of storage. I love this piece. I can hold a lot of stored items. I have had smaller version of this unit, this is the first large piece I have set up.

great value, cheap material, difficult assembly. The price is good for this product. appearance and feature is great.

Good but.... Directions indicate using a hammer to tap the shelves together. Unfortunately, any tapping WILL damage the finish/ crush some of the material that they're made from.;Directions with hammer - Negative.
Board split when putting it together. While this does feel a bit sturdy with weight on it, it wobbled a lot before adding things to the shelf. The wall brackets don't work due to the base boards (about an inch gap), so the entire shelf would have to be tilted to mount it to the wall. When we were putting it together, one of the holes on the board we had to put a peg in wasn't drilled/lined up properly, and a big chunk of the shelf came off. We glued it back on, and hope no one notices, because we don't have the HOURS it would take to stand in customer service waiting for a replacement board.;Board split - Negative, feels sturdy - Neutural, wobbled - Negative, Holes not aligned - Negative, Base boards issue - Negative, Wall brackets not compatible - Negative.

KALLAX Insert with door. We left some shelves open, some we closed with boxes, and some with doors. Perfect. My only recommendation would be to include larger screws.

Used to be better. This is the second set of drawers I have. The first I purchased were $20, matte finish, quality solid hardware, and slide nicely and fit perfectly in my Expedit.

Must lay flat to assemble.. The biggest challenge when my husband and I assembled this was laying it flat to do so. The upstairs of our home doesn't have any open floor spaces that large. That said, we assembled this unit in 45 minutes working as a team. I loaded it with photo albums and books and other than the dark colored wood showing dust like crazy we have been very happy with our purchase. We have another unit ten years old that's the same unit from ikea and it held a teenagers stuff till a few years ago when she moved out and now it holds crafting stuff. It still looks brand new.;Assemble flat - challenging, assembled in 45 minutes - neutral, holds photo albums - Positive, looks brand new - Positive, sturdy - Positive.
Cheap fitting.... Hi, While the furniture looks great, really great, I wish the fasteners were not cheap wood. It would have liked cam fitting with cam locks. That would make the mounting earlier, less noisy (no need to hammer and possibly damage the furniture) and safer. The dismounting and moving of the assembled furniture would have been much easier.  And once assembled, I start seeing the part come apart more easily with the wooden fastening, suggesting I should have glued things (which makes the furniture a little less ikea style). :(;Looks great - positive, cheap fitting - negative, wooden fasteners - negative, no cam lock - negative, less IKEA style - neutral, had to hammer - negative, less safe - negative.

Look great, perform ehhh. As noted, these drawers look great and we love the finish. Downside is that the drawers cannot hold much weight. We use these for a storage unit in our dining room and needed it to hold extra jar candles. Once you put more than two or three in a drawer, the drawer is weighed down and comes off the tracks.

. I Love the inserts. Very easy to install, too.;Inserts - Neutral, Easy to install - Positive.
Cheap and flimsy. These look great, but the installation requires you to screw into the unit where there are no holes. This means that you cannot move the doors and drawers around within the unit once you have made your decision, as it leaves ugly screw marks behind. Also, if you make a mistake and dont screw perfectly straight, you have multiple holes which make the product even weaker. The door installed slightly askew, despite my following the directions very well (I have put together Lego Mindstorms, if that's any indication of my pictorial directions-following abilities). The other installed slightly too low so that it rubs against the lower end of the shelf every time you open or close it. I consider myself pretty good at putting these things together. I think it is just poor design and weak materials. I gave it two stars overall because it does look nice.;Poor installation - Negative, thin materials - Negative, no adjustability - Negative, unsatisfying performance - Negative.
"Sturdy and functional. Extremely easy to assemble, great looking, and very sturdy!!! The only drawback was when we tried to add doors and drawers; they cannot be side-by-side due to the length of the screws.

We used baskets for the other cubes.";Extremely easy to assemble - Positive, Great looking - Positive, Very sturdy - Positive, Thin shelves - Negative.

Cheap and shallow. While these drawers looks nice, they are made of weak material that I fear may rot in humid weather. I took the advice of another post that said not to screw the sides into the unit. I had already screwed into it though, so the holes are there, but the drawers would not fit unless I removed those screws. I do not recommend this product. You get what you pay for, I suppose.;Looks nice - neutral, made of weak material - negative, fear of rotting - negative, not recommended - negative.

Excellent for beautiful and handy storage.. We have at least twelve of these now: seven for vinyl LP’s’ three for bedroom clothes storage, and two for bookcases. They adapt so well to most anything and fit sideways or upright into many small places. For small kit homes and bungalows throughout the North and Midwest, they are so handy that real estate agents should leave IKEA brochures on the kitchen counters of the homes they show.;Beautiful storage - Positive, handy storage - Positive, adaptable design - Positive, suitable for small spaces - Positive.
great sturdy piece for smaller spaces. The assembly is a little tricker vs your average wooden IKEA shelving unit. Pay close attention to the orientation of the holes alongside the frames. Once put together it really elevated the look of my bedroom- this looks like shelving that other popular high end stores sell for hundreds of dollars.  Tips: It helps to not tighten all the screws all the way until the end- this makes all the screws easier to place without metal of the frame not quite lining up and blocking the way for the screws.  The bamboo top does NOT come with pre-drilled holes, but the wood is soft enough and the screws for that element are pointy enough that once you line it up properly with the frame (use painter's tape to hold it in place if needed) and use a firmer overpressure while placing the screws with a manual screwdriver, they will go in and catch the surrounding wood with no problems. I actually don't advise pre-drilling holes because if the holes are too large then the screws won't catch as securely.;Small spaces - neutral, sturdy piece - Positive, assembly challenging - neutral, elevates look - Positive, looks like high-end store shelving - Positive, tips for assembly - neutral, soft bamboo top - neutral, screws catch surrounding wood securely - Positive.

Quite sturdy!. This is my third purchase of this product for my craft room and I totally love these shelves as they are so versatile in their usage. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I wanted this to match the ones I’ve bought in the past but they no longer carry the oak in the store near me so I had to get the white or black and decided on the white.

Great Look,Great Features,concerned about Quality. I purchased this to match another shelf in the series, and absolutely love the look and features. After waiting for months for this item to become available again, I looked forward to finally getting it home to put together. While I am mostly satisfied with the shelf, it seems the manufacturer rushed this batch and welded 2 components in the wrong direction! Another minor concern is that one of the doors does not line up with the other. I would think a proper Q/C inspection would have caught this. I ended up just removing the 2 components myself as the shelf will hold without them. Just wanted to leave constructive feedback so IKEA is aware!;Great look - Positive, great features - Positive, Quality concerns - Negative, welded components - Neutral, doors don't align - Negative.
New version is total garbage. We have about 7 of older version of these and needed one more. New one is horrible. 5 of the edge veneers were 90% unglued and needed to be glued and clamped.

Versatile, nice, modern.. Okay. I got this one because I wanted to get rid of the humongous entertainment center that I have. PROS: This came in handy being that it can be used in a vertical or horizontal way. It's not difficult to understand how to put it together, it takes little space when one has a small (office/living/dining) space. Clean, modern and versatile. CON: need two people to put it together if you don't have the space and or furniture to maneuver around it. The pegs need to be hammered in because no all holes are standard and some are smaller and is difficult for the pegs to go in. One has to do so very carefully. Otherwise, since is made of pressed sawdust, it becomes very easily to crack the edges. I don't remember if it states on the directions, but one needs a star screwdriver to put the little thingies that are mounted to the wall. No. It doesn't fit my cable box, but I have enough books to fill it in.;Vertical or horizontal use- Positive, Not difficult to assemble- Positive, Takes little space- Positive, Clean modern design- Positive, Two people required for assembly- Negative, Pegs require hammering instead of screws- Negative, No cable box fit- Neutral.

Great to help utilize the gaps in Kallax cubes. I bought this to go with two Kallax that are now being used as an entertainment center. The basket is great for my DVD player and roku to suspend up from the top of a cubby while sliding a smaller storage box underneath. Very stylish. One recommendation though, is that you be sure you have it where you want it and any electrical cords situated *before* you latch the back, because it is really difficult to unlatch if you decide you want to move it to a different compartment. Otherwise, no complaints!;Utilizes gaps in cubes - Positive, for entertainment center - Positive, very stylish - Positive, great for suspending items - Positive, be careful placing before assembly - neutral.
Sturdy bookshelf!. We bought our first Kallax shelf unit seven years ago. We bought another one a month ago.

Notwithstanding, this product is still incredibly sturdy and meets our needs perfectly! We love this product! We have used it as a bookshelf for our home library and also a toy shelving unit with the colorful buckets you find everywhere. The square is the perfect dimension and fits things nicely.

Nice looking, hard to install. The initial idea of installing this isn’t hard - the doors also look nice & is a great addition to my 4x2 unit. It’s figuring out the latches and actually getting the door to close without completely unscrewing them. A lot of times I thought the door would be screwed into the body and the door would pop off. It’s more me than the door, but still a bit hard. Overall, it’s a decent product.;Nice looking - Positive, hard to install - Negative.

Looks great, nightmare to assemble. As others noted the assembly is not the familiar post and dowel. It took me 4 hours on one of the units, as the pins and holes were not aligned well.

Looks nice for the most part. Assembled by myself in about one evening. The white looks nice in our room. However, I feel there's a small defect in the design that is more apparent with white 5x5 KALLAXes than with other models--the outside vertical boards seem to bow outward a little bit, to the point that there's a small gap between them and the ends of the middle horizontal boards.

"ultimately serves the purpose. I bought this to fit a small space in my son's room. I stacked three of them, stair-stepper fashion, as a book shelf. They serve the purpose that I bought them for, but I struggled to put them together. I tried for hours to get them to click. I watched several videos. I pushed, I pulled, I pounded. I did not want to damage them, but they would not budge. I had two of them three-quarters built, but I could not get the last side on. I took them back to the store and asked an IKEA employee to help me; otherwise, I was going to return them. The employee did help me. He slammed them together, and I built the third one at the little station in the store and used the hammer to finish the fourth side.

love the piece but assembly issues. furniture pieces arrived damaged with 2 divits and a chip.I decided to keep it because retuning it would be a hassle. when putting pieces together wooden dowels would not fit into holes.

It looks expensive and elegant. We have a modern furniture in our living room, in colors of black and burnt honey. This piece looks perfect with it. We also purchased 3 cloth storage bins to fit in the bottom, where we store all of our dog's stuff... bags, leash, cookies, harness. That way those are hidden but convenient.

The Worst. I brought this a month ago and it did not come with the screws for me to put the unit together. When I called the store about this problem they told me to contact the vendor who makes the unit. Needless to say I never got the screws and the unit is sitting and has not been put together.

Thank you for quality affordable products.;Small area organization - Neutral, budget but sturdy and attractive - Positive, worked perfectly - Positive, purchased another one - Positive.
Organizing Behemoth. I had a TaskRabbit person assemble this, but he did it quickly (an hour or less) and only needed my assistance holding it up to install the grounding hardware (err... walling hardware? whatever those pieces are to make sure a 200 pound shelf doesn't come crashing down on you). I meant to get the 4 x 4 one not the 5 x 5 one, but turns out I needed those 9 extra KALLAX cubes and that way I can decorate them them in fun ways too. I wish some of the inserts/organizers weren't so expensive, but the shelf as is, is a great value. I was surprised the parts fit in my Jeep Renegade and man it was difficult to get 66 lbs upstairs on my own (there are 4 boxes- 2 are 33 pounds, 2 are 66 pounds), but I did it. Now I want to replace an old book shelf I have with the 4 x 4 that can also double as a room divider.;Great value - Positive, sturdy - Positive, easy to assemble - neutral, heavy - negative, decorative cubes - neutral, wish inserts were cheaper - negative, fits in car - neutral, replacing old bookshelf - Positive.
Installation/Adjustment is a bit fiddly. Compared to to other IKEA furniture I've assembled, this one isn't quite as straightforward, and getting the door aligned so that it it is flush when closed is more difficult than I'd hoped.;Installation fiddly - Negative, door alignment - Neutral.
Bought two at the same time - one is heavier?. I bought two standard white 2x2 units during the after Christmas sale. Two boxes, stacked on top of one another. I had help loading and unloading my cart and vehicle, so I did not notice that one is marked 29lb and one is marked 42lb. Same item number, just a small 5 digit number to the side is one number off. I carried one box upstairs, assembled it, and then...could not pick up the second box. I'm not entirely sure what to do about this, or even what to think of it. I clicked through the different colors available on the website, and they, too, have inconsistent package weights listed at the time of writing this review, though none were as light as the 29lb model. Assembly of this lighter unit went about as well as expected, including the obligatory breaking of those little wooden dowels and having to scramble to find a suitable replacement in my collection of old baggies of extra Ikea hardware. I'm debating returning one or both units, and I will also be weighing my daughter's pink Kallax to see how those measure up. I guess the takeaway from this should be check the ENTIRE label, not just that the article numbers match up.;Two bought - Neutral, heavier unit - Negative, same item number - Neutral, inconsistent package weights - Negative, obligatory breaking dowels - Neutral, weighing other units - Neutral.

"Library shelves. In total, I have bought 3 of the 8-space units and 2 of the 4 space units. The 2 4 space units are stacked on 2 of the 8 space units for my library. Relatively easy to assemble. My only complaint was that 3 of the 5 units were missing 1 or 2 of the wooden dowels. I could have had some sent, but I was on a hurry to get this project done, so I cut up 5 1.7/8 pieces of 3/16 threaded steel rod I had, and used those. Worked fine! And they don't show.

Great shelf but damaged. Love this shelf but when I opened the box one of the pieces was dented. I put it together since it wasn’t a huge dent but when I went to put the glass in it couldn’t lay flat because of the dent.

Great value. Easy assembly;Great value - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive.
Difficult to put together and didnt Include screws. I bought this about a month ago and out of the huge order I placed this was easily the most difficult product to put together. The boxes require that you beat on them (leaving dents) with a hammer to make sure you can get all four corners in and even then it is challenging. On top of that after we *finally* got the boxes together we starting putting the wall mounts on and found that they didn’t include the screws you need to mount it to the wall. Like what’s the point then? I had to go to Home Depot to buy the screws where I could have just bought everything I needed for the wall mount and ignored buying this from ikea. Honestly the worst experience I’ve ever had putting together ikea furniture, usually it takes 15-20 minutes it’s easy and it looks great but not this time. I would never buy this again;Difficult assembly - negative, no included screws - negative, boxes required hammering - negative.

Staple piece. Love these cubby shelfs. We own three and they all work fabulously in our home, no matter how we choose to use them. My only qualm with this item particular it was not clearly labeled on the box that this was “glossy” when we wanted matte.

Works great, but consider it a permanent feature. I needed a couple of drawers for my keys and stuff that goes in my purse, these drawers work perfectly for that. Drawers fit great, no issues there. I just wish I didn't have to use screws to attach it to the main unit. If I ever remove this, there will be unsightly holes. Otherwise a great piece.;Drawers fit great - Positive, great piece - Positive, unsightly holes - Negative.
Best budget bookshelves I've ever bought. I bought four of these two years ago, after a lifetime of buying inexpensive chipboard bookcases that sagged. I'm about to buy another one now that I have a bit more space. They are practical, very strong, easy to move (I just did that) and the shelves don't sag despite their long span. Really terrific for the price. I'm surprised they are not easier to find on the IKEA web site--I'd be promoting these heavily.

Sturdy and looks good. I was hesitant to buy after seeing other reviews of being hard to assemble or missing/broke parts but I'm glad I ignored that and bought it.

lots of options. It is simple to put to together and they offer so many options to put in these cubicles. I put drawers and doors and some bins. Also bought a biggest 25 cubicle unit for another room. We were putting this one over a heater intake and I found legs on line that had adjustable heights from IKEA ! My husband did a couple things to it to make it earthquake proof instead of using their anti tip brackets because of the limited locations that the brackets had to go, they were not where the studs were but it's all good.

"Love the option. Should be redesigned. While it's great to be able to add doors for a relatively affordable amount (they quickly add up once you start put several in a kellax shelving unit!), the combination of the kellax not forming spaces of even and consistent size, will make adding these inserts a bit of a pain and very time consuming as they need a fair amount of tweaking. At times could get quite challenging depending on which position you need them installed as that would really make a difference since in some spots the kellax has inconsistent dimensions due to the structure not being as rigid as it 'd need to be for inserts to have a nearly perfect fit no matter where they're placed. Generally a re a good option and you can make it work well if you are resourceful when hitting a snag and have lots of patience which regardlessly is usually a chief requirement when assembling IKEA furniture to begin with. Just don't get upset or intimidated should something not fit perfectly... take a breath and a breath then think of the best solution to the misalignment, excessive gaps and do on... then get back to it and to try and see if what you thought about will fix the issue, most likely it will ;) If would be great to see these redesigned in a way which would not need so much tweaking, adding spacers, get different screws, adding adhesive sealing strips or padding where needed. Perhaps even get a cheap frosted plastic/lexan sheet swinging on a side tube that would act as a hinge where the top and bottom sides would have a shallow well to which the vertical plastic hinge would be anchored (just a thought) :)";Affordable doors - Positive, design improvement needed - Negative, inconsistent dimensions - Negative, tweaking required - Negative, patience required - Positive, resourceful problem solving - Positive, well-fitting inserts - Neutral.

I had read the reviews prior to purchasing and took note to follow the instructions. Make note of every attachment placement in the instructions as the pins/attachments are in different locations.

Love having doors, drawers, and bins. I really like have doors on the upper row of shelves in our 2 units. It is an easier way to access the things I store in there.

Mixed feelings. I had to return the unit I bought since I decided I didn't have the time to hack the unit from 2 to 1 rows. There is no Ikea unit that is 1 row, 2 columns with drawers insert.

Tons of space!. To start off, when they say multi-man lift in the instructions, they mean it. This thing is a beast. The unit assembled similarly to all other Kallax units (I've done the 2x2 and the 2x4 units also). The challenge for this one was manhandling the unit to get everything to slot in properly.  I will say since the unit is so big, there does seem to be a bit of flex or wiggle in the unit, but since you're pretty much going to bolt it to the wall, it doesn't really matter. The amount of flex isn't much, so most probably wouldn't notice. I did need to use a hammer and a piece of scrap wood to tap things flush multiple times, especially with the final end piece. All in all, if you've put other Kallax pieces together in the past, this one is no surprise other than the sheer weight of the unit.;Multi-man lift - Neutral, Assembled similar to other units - Neutral, Bigger unit - Positive, Challenging assembly - neutral, Bit of flex - neutral, Bolting to the wall - Positive.

HORRIBLE TO ASSEMBLE. It's a beautiful piece of furniture, along with the whole collection But it was so hard to assemble. it took me 3 days. I'm not good at Ikea furniture,but out of the 3 pieces I bought, this was the hardest. Also, its not even fully assembled. the boards you place as shelving, come with screws to hold them in place...No clue how tiny screws are supposed to hold a thick board in place but okay...I don't know if I received wrong pieces, or the instructions were just confusing. It took 2 of us to attempt and a day later, it was still wrong so i went back the following 2 days to correct.

Minimal, elegant design. A nice shelving unit that fits into a wide variety of decors. A friend commented that it looks more expensive than the actual cost. Once assembled, it does have a slight wobble but when its mounted against the wall, its very secure and won't budge. I use it to hold paperbacks and light hardcover books and there is little to no bowing of the shelves. For heavier hardcover art books, I would recommend the smaller Fjalkinge unit. The drawers are spacious and glide easily and I like that I can add more drawers or shelves in the future, if needed.

Revised review. I wrote a 1-star review that was strongly critical, in part, of what I regarded a near-impossible assembly requirements, noting that I have woodworking skills. Well, last night, after closely reviewing the assembly instructions over and over I realized that the assembly issues were my own fault. I still can't explain the issues with one of the three cabinets, but the issues with the other cabinet were because, when I assembled the cabinet, before the last piece was to be attached, I had (essentially) a C configuration, with piece 1 at the top of the C, where I should have had an upside down U configuration, with piece 1 at the top of the upside down U. I'm sure this makes no sense without the instructions. But what I can say is that, when I had the cabinet in the proper upside down U position, the last piece attached easily, without the problems I had been having. I therefore believe I caused the problem, and I caution anyone else building the cabinets to be very attentive to the specifics of the assembly instructions and to not attempt to attach the final piece unless and until the cabinet is in the proper upside down U position with piece 1 at the top of that upside down U.;Assembly instructions - Neutral, C configuration - neutral, upside down U position - neutral, proper positioning - positive, caution others - neutral.

This is not as simple as it looks. We have bought and constructed MANY Ikea products in different cities and countries and this one confounded us which only maddened us as it SEEMS so simple.

Makeshift Lingerie Dresser. Great price compared to similar products at other retailers and far sturdier than ones I've tested. Since they stopped making the Hemnes lingerie dresser, I needed something when we replaced out bedroom set. This is working as a great temporary fix with fabric bins. It is one of the easiest IKEA pieces to assemble and is a quick build. The veneer feels fragile and like any movement or touch will scratch it.

"Sturdy, minimal industrial look. The minimal, industrial look of this shelf unit doesn't look overbearing in my small apartment. The satin, slightly textured black finish of the metal is well done. The wood shelves are solid pine wood with a rustic looking stain. Once the feet are adjusted and the unit level with the floor, it becomes very sturdy even if you don't screw it into the wall (which I would do for safety, especially if you have kids or pets). Assembly of this unit can be tedious and took me about 3 hours to get together. For example, in step 6 of the assembly instructions, the hole at the middle vertical bar was tight and you might need to open it up a bit by turning the screw a few times before assembling the bottom shelf to it. Even then, you have little leeway to turn the screwdriver; go slowly so you don't strip the screw head. Also, for step 9, one of the small jutting bars of the side frame that connects to the bottom shelf was welded with a hair's width of misalignment. In order for the pieces to fit together, I had to nudge it by lightly tapping it using a hammer covered with a protective cap. You may need to touch up any screw heads with black marker or paint if you scraped off the finish with the screwdriver. What would make this look even better? A crossbar for the back might add extra sturdiness. The same goes for the sides; either a crossbar or mesh sheet similar to the bottom shelf could keep books from sliding out. Otherwise, a nice looking and inexpensive take on industrial shelving.";Minimal industrial look - Positive, Satin black finish - Positive, Solid pine wood shelves - Positive, Rustic looking stain - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, Assembly tedious - Neutral, Adjustable feet - Positive, Safety recommendation - Neutive, Misaligned jutting bar - Neutral, Screwdriver damage - Neutral, Crossbar suggestion - Positive, Back reinforcement - Positive.

Difficult to assemble, cheap material. We are so disappointed with this shelf. We have purchased many other pieces from Ikea that appeared more difficult to assemble, but this shelf was by far the worst. We thought it would be a piece of cake but boy were we wrong. The pieces simply would not go together correctly, and the wood chipped away in places. We followed the directions and took our time, I swear our pieces had to be flawed. If our IKEA store wasn’t so far away, we would have definitely returned it. However, it is over an hour drive. Sadly we went to IKEA for this shelf (and lunch in the food court!) only. What a wasted day. The shelf was intended for organizing my daughter’s closet. We ended up assembling it without the back ( it was the only way we could get the pieces to fit together.). It is chipped in places which disappoints me. I felt it was a little pricey for IKEA to begin with, but the dimensions were spot on for our needs. I am very disappointed with how it all turned out though.

Can’t believe these are extremely hard to assemble. Just as other reviews have stated, these cubes require a lot of force up to the point that you’re splitting the wood. I have bought 10 of these and every single side of each one was extremely hard to connect together. The first three sides were okay but once you put that back panel in... that fourth side will not go in at all! The holes are not drilled into properly making assembly such a difficult process.

Worst Design Ever!!!. Like some others, I registered just to write this review. This piece is the worst design of anything I've ever encountered at IKEA. I just bought two of them and have bene through an ordeal trying to get them to assemble properly. The first one required that I trim about an 1/8 inch off the back in order for the final side piece to fit in, but this was only after struggling mightily with it for a while and damaging the wood in the process. Two things have to happen at once for the last piece to fit in. The pegs have to line up, and the back piece has to be in the grooves of the other sides. This would require bending both time and space. On the second cabinet I snapped one of the shoddy plastic pegs with light pressure and then while the super glue to fix it was drying on that, I snapped 3 more pegs just trying to move the stupid thing out of the way. It's like they are made out of Derrick Rose's knees.  Just an awful design, a horrible experience, and makes me seriously question IKEA's (and Sweden's) commitment to quality. There are 4 stars reviews on here where they clearly say they had to leave the back off the cabinet. How can you give a 4 star review if there is a major piece that doesn't fit? That's insane. If I didn't want a back on it, I would have bought the Kallax.;Worst design ever - negative, encountered ordeal assembling - negative, damaged wood - negative, pegs snapped - negative, question quality - negative, major piece doesn't fit - negative.

Amazing. Im so happy this product is amazing;Product is amazing - Positive.
Exception proves the rule. I have 7 of the Kallax shelve in my home in different sizes, 3 in just the 57x57. I have LOVED these shelves as they have worked beautifuly, coming in different sizes and colours. The closest IKEA store is an hour and a half away so when I happened to pass by it on the end of my trip yesterday I just had to get another! The box it came in was pristine but on opening it to put it together one of the internal pieces was damaged with a deep dent bigger than a quarter and unable to hide if I put it together. After an hour on the phone with customer service due to the size a repacement piece can not be sent my only options are to drive the 1.5h to either swap out the shelf/whole box, to return it... Or to deal with it. So in short its generally a great product, but if you aren't near an IKEA you run the risk of having your day ruined by an eye-sore that makes the products statement looks great from any angle completely false.;Loved 7 shelves - Positive, Different sizes and colors - Positive, Close IKEA store - Neutral, Damaged internal piece - Negative, Unable to hide damage - Negative, long phone call with customer service - Neutral.

Not hard if you can read and follow directions. We bought four of these for use by our children for toy and book storage. They are not difficult to put together if you read and follow the directions.

Quality is hit and miss. I bought 4 of these units. 3 were made of great material that will hold up well.

Good shelf unit to keep your house organized. We bought this to organize our clothes in the closet as it's much cheaper than anything else. Works perfectly fine for our purpose. The wood came with some small defects, which was really annoying, but we didn't botter to take it back and exchange the product. It's much stronger and more stable than the competitors' products (Walmart and Target), so I recommend it.;Organizes house - Positive, Works perfectly fine - Positive, Small defects - Negative, Stronger and more stable - Positive.

Great item, could be even better with minor tweaks. We bought this item to replace a bookshelf and a TV stand and were very pleased with the overall results. The TV on top is out of the way but still watchable for our little kids. The storage below with bins makes our living room look significantly more organized. Our bin storage ranges from kids' toys and DVD's to new tissue boxes and new paper towel rolls. We considered the 5 x 5, but are very happy with this option instead. It was also a bonus that assembly was simple. The only minor tweaks which would make this unit better: 1 Add a slight cut-in at the bottom for baseboards. Attaching to the wall for safety is cumbersome when it sticks out so far because of floor trim. Other units have such a cut-in to make things more home-friendly. 2. Add an optional, additional matching color, box-bin with a front cabinet door. It could latch in the back to stay stationary, but allow for more customization. Overall: Great shelf unit.;Replaced bookshelf and TV stand - Positive, out of the way for kids - Positive, organized living room - Positive, simple assembly - Positive, minor tweaks for improvement - Neutral, added baseboard cut-in - Neutral, optional cabinet door - Neutural.

The assembling is not as easy as other IKEA products. I have been a loyalty IKEA customer for decades and I had assembled at least 30+ IKEA furniture all by myself successfully until I met the KALLAX 5*5 Shelf unit. I am not sure if it is just me or the product that I received. It seems that all 4 side boards in my packages don't have holes deep enough to hold the wooden pegs. I tried everything to make it right, finally chose to drill the hole more deeper and hammered the pegs to make it shorter, and eventually the pieces were put together. However, there are still ugly gaps in both sides through which I can see some peg parts, plus there are bumps on the side boards now as I tried to hammer them together from the board sides. Very frustrating! AND the piece is too large to be taken apart for return.;Assembly challenging - negative, loyalty customer - neutral, 30+ successful assemblies - neutral, side boards holes shallow - negative, pieces gaps visible - negative, peg parts visible - negative, size large - neutral.

Very functional. I purchased a larger unit like this one 15 years ago, but it was called Expedit. That unit served me well so I searched the IKEA site and found Kallax. It seems this product has changed names. I use this unit to store my card making supplies. I even purchased a couple of the storage boxes that fit in the unit as well.

Great Unit. I bought this unit a month ago for my new apartment and I do like it. It is not as sturdy as I would like but it definitely works for me. Keeps all my clothing and items nice and organized and I use it instead of a dresser. It was a pain to put together though. I would have preferred some screws holding the shelves together instead of only dowels and including some extra dowels would be much appreciated.

Know what you're getting into!. I installed the turquoise-gray doors on a gloss-white Kallx unit. I had read the installation instructions before purchasing and thought I knew what I was getting into, so learn from my mistake! First, plan your layout. Once these inserts go in, you do not want to move them somewhere else. You have to screw these into the sides of the Kallax cubes, which means putting holes in the finish. It will help (a lot) if you have a drill and bit handy to create a pilot hole. I also use paint tape to put the spacer guides on the shelf while I did the installation so that I could make sure the insert was properly aligned throughout. As previous reviewers mentioned, make sure you check the back page of the installation guide for instructions on how to adjust the hinges up, down, forward, and backwards for aligning the doors evenly. I found using a few thicknesses of cardboard to hold the door where I wanted it helped too. Installation of four doors took about an hour. And buying four doors in high-gloss paint cost me more than the entire 4x4 Kallax itself. Not entirely happy about that, but it looks good.;Installing doors - neutral, turquoise-gray doors - neutral, gloss-white Kallax unit - neutral, check installation instructions - neutral, plan layout - neutral, put holes in finish - negative, have drill and bit handy - positive, use paint tape - positive, align doors - positive, adjust hinges - positive, installation took approximately one hour - neutral, cost of doors in high-gloss paint - negative.

Looks Like a Built-In. We bought two of the 4-cube units as a base and two 8-cube units to sit on top of those. Our builder made a wooden frame complete with pieces that covered the seams, and we painted it with glossy white to match. It now looks like a huge built-in shelving unit at a third of the price. We added drawers and doors to four of the bottom cubes, and a few of the other accessories to the top. It looks great! We painted the back wall to add a pop of color behind the shelves. Very happy with this solution. A few dings in the shelves, so not perfect, but we touched those up.

Really looks nice!. This adds a lot of beauty to the KALLAX shelf unit. Upped its appearance, making it look like a higher end purchase, other than something I put together myself.

Roomy cubbies, simple assembly!. I put together my first two Kallax (2x4) shelves (all by myself!) in about 90 leisurely minutes. I'm pleased with the overall simplicity of assembly! I read in another review that a rubber mallet can come in handy for pushing together pieces. When I wasn't hammering, I just held the shelving with my hands and nudged it with my rubber-soled, non-marking combat boots...for me, this worked beautifully (and the shelf remained absolutely undamaged). All the parts fit together flawlessly. I assembled it atop a carpeted surface and would recommend this. The hardest part of the entire shelving experience was taking the boxes off the shelf at IKEA—because they were heavier than I'd expected—but the kind IKEA staff helped me put them on my cart, and another staff member helped me load them into my vehicle.

Problem Solver. We bought this to solve a space/table problem. Every table we have ever placed in our breakfast nook has been a bust. We needed something where we could stash grandkid's backpacks, colors and crafts, all sorts of things. With the boxes this organizes a lot of things that would take over kitchen junk drawers, got the kiddos projects off the dining room table, opened up a small space that is usually overwhelmed by standard dining tables. It was a great choice.;Solves space problem - Positive, stores grandkid's items - Positive, organizes items - Positive, opens up space - Positive.

Exactly what I asked for.. I bought this for storage for a sewing/craft area in my basement. I bought the high-gloss white, which looks very classy. I decked it out with four sets of drawers and 4 doors (in high-gloss turquoise-gray) in the top two rows, opting to put fabric bins in the rest. The important thing to note is that the installation of the drawers and doors took longer than assembling the unit itself. Tons of storage nicely hidden now. Am thinking of putting a 2x4 Kallax on top for even more places to hide stuff. Buying on sale at Friends & Family pricing makes this even more attractive. This isn't museum quality, but it's sturdy, useful, and meets the price point for what I'm using it for.;Bought for storage - Neutral, High-gloss white - Positive, four sets of drawers - Positive, four doors - Positive, installation took longer - Neutral, tons of hidden storage - Positive, considering adding another unit - Positive, attractive price point - Positive.

I love it!. It’s strange to say but this shelf added life to my living room! And building it was cake!;Added life to living room - Positive, building it was easy - Positive.
"Disappointing. They took me three times as long to finish than the unit itself! There's no written directions; just pictures. They expect you to screw through two layers of board and into the unit to set the doors.. With a screwdriver and an incredibly short screw. These will absolutely test your upper body force and strength. The knobs are a joke. They're tiny and have no grip to open with ease. I purchased them for functionality but, in my opinion, they play more of an aesthetic role. I ended up finishing but realized I had screwed in one for backwards. (it could have been fine but I wanted the knobs together). I made the decision to take the one side out and screw it back in on the other side. I physically couldn't do it. Trying to screw those little screws in through such thick layers took every ounce of energy out of me. My boyfriend tried finishing it for me and even he couldn't. We ended up having to glue it in.  Lastly, for a piece of wood, you're paying (assuming you bought two like the picture shows) almost as much for the unit itself. Crazy.  I don't recommend.";Three times as long assembly - Negative, no written instructions - Negative, expected to screw through multiple layers - Negative, tiny knobs - Negative, barely any grip - Negative, paid a lot for the unit - Negative, wouldn't recommend - Negative.

I got burned buying these.... These are a really great product line. I plunged in head first and built my home office with a full set of these. (2) 5x5 units on the walls, 1 4x4 unit in the middle and another 4x2 unit against my near wall. But alas, I went with Birch and now it appears that Birch is discontinued so I'm left without any ability to get drawers, doors or accessories that match. What am I supposed to do? rip it all out and convert to white? black will make the whole office a black tomb. I'm really bummed. I like the design, and the accessories work really well, but if I can't buy more what the heck am I supposed to do?;Burned by purchase - Negative, great product line - Positive, well-designed - Positive, accessories work well - Positive, bummed - Negative, Birch discontinued - Negative.

Can't get enough of 'em.. We loved the industrial look of the Fjallbo, especially the fact that it uses real, solid wood. Very sturdy, but easy to build and light enough to move alone (when empty).

Very sturdy unit. I bought 2 of these for my extensive collection of LP's and 78's. The size is perfect for albums and I needed something that could hold the weight. This thing is very well constructed (although you have to assemble it). It went together like a champ, taking me about 20 minutes each. However there are 2 weights of these units when I bought mine and opted for the heavier one. If I remember correctly the price was the same for either weight. I am careful not to overload the shelves since vinyl records tend to be very heavy, but haven't had any problem whatsoever yet.

Handsome Industrial Style. Bought this about a month ago--so I can't yet speak to it's durability--but it is a very attractive addition to our home. It was pretty easy to put together, even for me (with chronic pain), but watch out for those little holes where the webbing adds a decorative touch. It is easy to put together backwards and have to start again. (I know from experience.) The shelves are quite spacious, and there's not a lot of structure to hold books or such on the shelf without assistance. I am currently using mine combined with dark stained wooden crates. The crates hold notebooks: the wood slats coordinate with the wood look on the top and disguise the not-so-pretty notebooks for a cohesive look.;Attractive addition - Positive, pretty easy to put together - Positive, decorative webbing holes require caution - Neutral, spacious shelves - Positive, not much structure for books without assistance - Neutral, using with crates - Neutral.

Pretty competitive price too.;Fits board games well - Positive, right size - Positive, quick build - Neutral, sturdy - Positive, competitive price - Positive.
Bad design compared to older version. (note: this is a similar review I left on the drawers) If you ever purchased an older version of this you will hate this new version. You have to screw these into the shelving structure, so once they are there, they aren't moving unless you want to see all of the holes left behind. Being able to change how you used these in the old version was a great feature (especially if you move a lot). I am very disappointing in this new version. Quality is very low and it is not easy to install especially if you want the doors to be straight.;Disappointing new version - Negative, Bad design - Negative, screw in design - Negative, Low quality - Negative, not easy to install - Negative.

Solid cabinet.. This cabinet is real Solid! The instructions recommended not to put the cabinet together with 1 person only, but I figure I try, and if it does not work, get help.

Quality has declined sharply. I bought the Kallax storage unit probably 6-8 years ago and bought a few inserts for it. Back then, while they were still the particleboard that's been laminated (and I bought it knowing that an not expecting high end furniture) it was at least sturdy and you could move it around from one hole in the frame to another, or you could flip it around so that it was a left opening door instead of a right opening one, for instance. It made it really convenient to change the purpose of the unit. I decided to put the unit in another room and change around the inserts, get a couple of more inserts with doors and one with a drawer. Now the inserts are super cheaply made out of something just north of cardboard that's been laminated and now you have to screw it into the base unit, which means you're putting holes in that and now you have lost the flexibility of changing how you're using the base unit. The only part if the same material as before is the door. Very disappointed, and will be returning it for a refund.

We definitely recommend it!;Created cozy feeling - Positive, looks great - Positive, heavy box to carry - Neutral, hour to assemble - Neutral, recommend it - Positive.

LAST A LIFETIME!. We have had ours for over a decade, and it's still in great shape!

Great shelf....for something other than books.. I bought this shelf a bout a month ago. It was fairly easy to put together and seemed packaged REALLY well to avoid dings and breakage. Had it assembled in less than 30 minutes and it’s as sturdy as can be. The levels on the legs were a nice touch since it’s on carpet and things seem to tip if they aren’t set down just right. The only downside is that it’s too tall to sub as an entry console and since the shelves aren’t adjustable....won’t hold average sized books upright without heavy bookends. since the middle shelf is glass, that doesn’t seem like the best idea for us. Would probably make a great bar cart/shelf or storage for extra pillows/throws....even in a DIY closet revamp as part of a “system”. Just wasn’t the right piece for us, so we are going to return it.;Easy to put together - Positive, Packaged well - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, levels on legs - Positive, Glass middle shelf - Negative, not for books - Negative, DIY closet revamp - Neutral.
Easy assembly. Works great for storage in my sewing room.;Easy assembly - Positive, works great - Positive.
Useful but could be better. Pretty decent, but left a little to be desired. The main box and the drawer bottoms are flimsy cardboard, which doesn't matter as much since it's going in your shelves but is still a little disappointing. And the drawers are way shallower than I expected, about half the height of the front of the drawer you see when it's closed. And finally, when you're installing them, you have to screw them into your shelves, so it turns what I thought would be a modular design, one that I could move around or remove as I liked, into a semi-permanent addition, because if you take the drawers out, you're left with 4 big holes in the sides of the shelf where you installed it. So make sure you're happy with the slot you decide to put this in before you finish installing it.;Flimsy cardboard - Negative, Shallow drawers - Negative, modular design - Neutral, semi-permanent addition - Negative.

Good product for some, not for all.. We have been using the kallax system since it was known as the (superior) expedit system. We needed a few new inserts. We saw the design change and opted to try them out. After reviewing the instructions before actually installing and then seeing the other reviews, I'm going to return this. The beauty of the original models was the ability to change the drawers with your needs. This new model requires for it to be permanently installed (or leave holes when you move the drawer). If you like versatility, pass on this. If you are ok with a permanent install, this should work for you but review other reviews around the challenges. I imagine Ikea is adapting design to reduce wood consumption,which should be applauded but something has been lost here.;New design - Neutral,Requires permanent install - negative, Versatility lost - Negative, Review other challenges - Neutral.
Nice solid piece, multiple uses. I am currently working to convert a spare bedroom in my house into an office/craft/music room and I needed low profile storage for funky musical instruments. Once assembled, this product is solid. It is also light and easy to move around.  I feel as if I changed my mind about using the the shelf unit for storage, I could readily use it any place else for storage and it would not be out of place. The top is a nice high to stand and do a task on it and my only complaint is one of the doors is not fully aligned straight, but it is not so noticeable. (I think I notice it because I assembled it and tried switching the doors and parts to make it straighter.)   Depending on needs, I would recommend this for video games with additional shelving. It's a great height to sit or stand and play and the back of the cabinet is open for wires and what-not. It would also make a great sideboard for dishes or an aquarium, too.;Solid piece - Positive, multiple uses - Positive, easy to move - Positive, good height for tasks - Positive, one door misaligned - neutral.

If taking more than 10 min, you're doing it wrong. And, I say that out of experience. By the last one, I was able to get the frame put together in under 5 minutes. Like others have noted, the directions have to be followed exactly. 1) Connect the top (#1) with one of the sides, 2) construct the T and snap it in place, 3) add the other side, 4) slide in the backing, and 5) insert the bottom (which has connectors like #1). After it's put together, secure everything in place with fasteners. No chips, broken pieces, or agony. I, too, was guilty of user error. The first one took way too long and with too much effort. I felt pretty silly when I was able to put together the last one so quickly. It really is all outlined in the pictures.;Easy assembly - Positive, under 5 minutes - Positive, detailed instructions - Positive, secure with fasteners - Positive.

Looks good but can be frustrating to say the least. I bought two drawer and two door inserts. The drawers are a breeze and hard to mess up. The doors.. not so much. If your Kallax isnt perfectly straight it shows in the installation. I have an elevated 8 cube set up landscape with 6 legs and one door went on perfectly while the other was slanted. I usually love building IKEA furniture and don't mind decoding the instructions but the section on adjusting the doors after installation really needs more clarification. After fiddling with the screws for a while I finally got it looking straight but it's very unstable and not something that could be used frequently. Also keep in mind that you can't adjust screws in particleboard very much without stripping the hole. These inserts are better for people who aren't bothered by minor imperfections otherwise it's a toss up. Note: another reviewer said there is nothing to stop the door from going in but that's not true. The insert is designed to be its own door stop if you put it in right.;Frustrating assembly - negative, drawer inserts easy to install - neutral, door inserts problematic - negative, minor imperfections acceptable - neutral, stability an issue - negative.

Finally, a three column version of the Kallax!. We have used the two columns by four row Kallax shelf units for years and were excited when a three column by four row version became available. We added a few Kallax doors/drawer to the bottom row and a few baskets to the open cubbies. We like how the white shelves blend in with our white walls and are not a focal point to the space.;Three column Kallax - positive, add doors/drawers - positive, blend in with walls - positive.
Loved it!. I bought this table to setve as a hall table in my foyer. I love the mix of metal with wood! Its industrial yet a little rustic looking which totally fits my style. My only qualm is that one of the cabinet drawers doesn't line up just right, and it seems to be a manufacturing issue. That issue is not a big deal, though because the door still seems to latch on to the magnet and close.

Kallax rocks!. I had two of the old Expedit shelves and have regretted leaving them behind when we moved 6 years ago. I just replaced my old loves with two Kallax units and I couldn’t be happier!

Great quality at a very fair price.;Favorite IKEA pieces - Positive, great quality - Positive, fair price - Positive, replaced old shelves - Positive, neat look - Positive, took care of clutter - Positive.
good idea. Very strange concept to make this insert our of what looks like sturdy cardboard since it has to screw into the sides of the hole.

These used to be made of wood not cardboard. I bought this one because IKEA no longer makes the large drawer version (Why not?!). Also on the subject of things IKEA doesn't make, why isn't there a propper half shelf for the KALLAX system? I'd buy at least 4 of those badboys, instead we have this weird shelf that sticks out halfway. Anywhoo, the older versions of these were made of wood so they were sturdier without any storage space sacrificed. The new ones are made of cardboard and fall apart easily.;Used to be made of wood - Neutral, sturdier construction - Positive, cardboard version falls apart - Negative, large drawer version no longer available - Neutral, no half shelves in KALLAX system - Negative.

Another product is better. Surprised, but I would not recommend. We bought this one, for $5 less than the Better Homes and Garden identical looking product sold elsewhere. The other brand had already shipped to our house(for free), and we needed 1 more, so I went to Ikea and bought this one. My husband put them together at the same time and we were SHOCKED to see that the other brand was a better quality, sturdier installation method, etc. The $5 savings doesn't even come close to being worth it, and that's before factoring in the other one will deliver to your house.;Identical looking product - Neutral, not recommended - Negative, cheaper ($5 less) - Neutral, lower quality - Negative, poor installation method - Negative.

I had my eyes set on a tv stand already but the second time I came back to purchase it my husband hated it and saw this shelf and said this would be great as our tv stand instead, I didn't even realize it could have be used as one. I'm glad he came and seen this because not only does it work out as a stand, the storage is great for all the kids toys, with the purchase of the storage boxes that are sold separately. The price is great as well.;Great tv stand - Positive, Storage is great - Positive, Kids toys - Neutral, Good price - Positive.
Shelves degraded in quality. I bought 4 of these Kallax units and although they have a great design the shelving material has been substantially changed. I had to return 2 sets because I ordered glossy white instead of flat white. I was surprised the replacement box for the flat white shelves was so much lighter than the glossy white and also lighter than my prior purchase of same Kallax u it in flat white.  Turns out all the shelves are not made of heavy mdf material but are hollow with a honey comb strengthening system on the interior. Not great for doing Kallax hacks with the material.

I put together three pieces of ikea furniture this past week, and the other two were relatively simple, hour or two. This took like five hours.

Kallax and accessories. I did buy a 4 cube Kallax about 1 month ago after looking at it extensively as a storage solution in the kitchen.

Great for teen bedroom. We bought this unit for my 13yo son's room, and it's a perfect addition. It's a huge piece of furniture, so putting it together took some time and a rubber mallet to get everything tight. Then lifting it was quite a beast...definitely a two or even three person job. But it only took a couple of hours, and the result is well worth the effort.;Perfect addition - Positive, huge piece of furniture - Neutral, putting it together took time - Neutral, required rubber mallet - Neutral, lifting it required multiple people - Negative, worth the effort - Positive.

Where are the holes?!?. Love this piece for reasons stated elsewhere (aesthetic, functionality, etc.). However, why are there no pre-drilled pilot holes for the wood piece? I had to wait 2 months until I could find someone who could make the holes so I could finish inserting the wood screws.  Make sure you follow the directions carefully to make sure all the pieces are facing the right way.;Love this piece - Positive, aesthetic and functional - Positive, no pre-drilled holes - Negative, had to wait 2 months - Negative, followed directions - Neutral.
Inconsistent color. Bring back old design.. Nice gloss finish, but the white color is inconsistent between different lots/styles. I Purchased some doors and drawers at the same time and the doors are more off white than the drawers. I then went back within a years time to purchase two more drawers and those drawers are more of a pure white. Please do something to make the coloring more consistent. Please also bring back the old design where the door was a freestanding unit with thicker laminated wood sides instead of flimsy cardboard that must be screwed to the cabinet. Having to screw the doors to the cabinet takes away from the flexibility of the kallax unit as you can’t just move them around later.;Inconsistent white color - Negative, old design - Positive, gloss finish - Neutral, door flexibility - Negative.
Changes the appearance of our wall unit. Love it. Decided to finally fancy up the old Expedit we use in the office. Bought a set of these drawers and love them. The install wasn't hard, but you need to follow directions. They look great and completely changes the look of the wall unit. We also bought some of the doors for other spaces and love the way it all looks.;Upgraded wall unit - Positive, bought drawers - Neutral, not hard to install - Neutral, follow directions - Neutral, great look - Positive, also bought doors - Positive.
Organization essential. These are great to have. I like a neat and tidy work space and these are great for that.;Organization essential - Positive, neat and tidy - Positive.
"Beautiful and Sturdy, But those dang wooden pegs!. The Kallax is absolutely beautiful. The shelf space is very generous, and the whole construction seems sturdy. The white colorway is a pure white, not cream-tinted at all. It makes for a beautiful book shelf, display shelf, or even room divider, since it is backless. The Drona boxes, shelves, etc. allow for a lot of storage and customization options as well.  BUT, the entire thing is held together with those little wooden pegs. There are 8 screws in the whole thing, at each of the outside corners. Everything else is wooden pegs. They are impossible to get in properly by yourself, and even with help, they are incredibly difficult. If your hands start turning red and hurting and you decide to break out the hammer, or try to hold it together and end up wobbling a piece, you may just break some of the pegs and be left wondering ""how am I going to finish this now."" Luckily, I did receive 2 extra pegs. However, that doesn't really help when the broken one is already stuck inside the shelf. So I had to break out the command poster strips and hold it together that way. Which seems to be working great, actually! I used 3 strips on each shelf connection that went pegless.  I do admit that breaking the pegs was my fault (and thus why I'm still giving this a 5 star review) but seriously, you're going to need assistance holding it all together until the final screws, and someone else's hands to rub raw from the wooden pegs after yours have taken all they can.";Beautiful design - Positive, sturdy construction - Positive, generous shelf space - Positive, customizable storage - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative (due to the wooden pegs).
Worst bookcase every. I've gotten a lot of IKEA furniture and this the worst! I built it and as soon as I stood it up all the shelves fell and broke. The shelves are helped up by wood pieces that easily break. I want to return.;Fell and broke - Negative, shelves helped up by easily broken wood pieces - Negative, building experience - Negative, wanting to return - Negative.
Fantastic piece for an industrial look. The shelf is such a nice piece to look at in my new home, I’m so glad I was able to purchase it. It really goes well with my late grandpa’s steel worker figures. I also had some issues installing the doors, but what I did was screw the screws in little at a time and adjust the doors as needed before I screwed again. When I was putting this shelf together, I was working alone. As for not having a drill for the insertion of screws into the wooden planks, it’s incredibly easy to just press the screw into the wood where you want it to be and it’ll leave an imprint. It doesn’t require a lot of muscle, I don’t work out and have little lady arms. From there, hold the screw in place and press firmly with the screwdriver into the screw as you twist, just enough to keep it in place. I have a drill, didn’t use it. Start with the middle points, they have the best access points in terms of hand space.;Industrial look - Positive, nice piece - Positive, glad to purchase - Positive, looks great with figures - Positive, had issues installing doors - neutral, easy to press screws into wood - Positive, no need for drill - Positive, easy hand assembly - Positive, easy muscle requirement - Positive.

Great addition to my den. My den is furnished with a lot of high-end items so I was concerned this wouldn't fit in with the quality of my items. I was wrong!

HORRIBLE!! Unsturdy. We purchased the Kallax storage cubes in the 3x4 cube variation and loved it so much we thought we should get another one just a little bigger. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! We chose the unit with 4x4 cubes and it is a heaping pile of junk. The outer boards are bowed and the inside pieces won’t even go together all the way so you can see the pegs between the shelves. It’s so unsteady they give you a special bracket to mount on the wall to keep it from wobbling but IT WONT EVEN GO ON 2 STUDS!;Unstable - Negative, poorly made - Negative, won't go together properly - Negative, bowed outer boards - Negative, bracket needed to mount - Negative.

Where are the holes?!?. Love this piece for all the reasons stated in the other reviews (aesthetic, quality, strength, functionality, etc.). However, I had to wait 2 months to finish the piece until I could find a friend with the proper equipment to drill the holes to insert the wood screws. Why can't IKEA put pilot holes on this?

Great idea. The idea of modules you can put in your shelving system is pure genius. These drawers work well and look good.

Smaller than unit bought previously. Same great quality as our previously purchased Kallax unit of the same configuration but about 1/2-1 inch smaller on the outer perimeter boards. As we bought this unit to stack it with our older Kallax units it matters but across the room it wouldn’t be very noticeable.  I admit that our older units are perhaps 10 or more years older and completely understand that IKEA can and should refresh and make updates to their products.  In our case I was not pleased to have missed the window for exactly matching our older units.  Having said that, I’d definitely recommend this unit as it is easy to assembly (especially when using a 9 yo helper), sturdy enough to hold a large number of books or other items and attractive. For the money, it’s a great addition to our household.;Smaller outer perimeter - Negative, same great quality - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, sturdy - Positive, attractive - Positive.

Always versatile. I bought this along with the 2x2 and the 1x4 Kallax units. I have them stacked with 3x4 on the bottom (4 wide x 3 tall) the 2x2 next with the 1x4 on top as a bridge. This has left a 2x2 “hole” on the one side for my computer. I have dubbed it “The Monstrosity”. So far (three weeks of use) it has been great. I love the flexibility of being able to stack and configure the Kallax units to fit a variety of needs. The only reason I didn’t give them a 5 star rating is the lack of connecting hardware. Although hardware is included to mount the Kallax units to the wall to prevent them from falling over, no hardware is provided to connect stacked units together. This is really important in a configuration such as I have created to increase stability in the whole piece. Granted, it was a simple matter to purchase the appropriate brackets at the hardware store and drill the pilots holes myself, but still, it would be nice to have such hardware included with the units. I’m sure people besides myself also stack these units in unique and creative ways. Including the brackets would be the safe thing to do. Also, the door and drawer inserts are not the most sturdy of design nor the easiest to install.

Easy to put together. This is very similar to the old square storage shelf, but it's much easier to put together. This one is put together vertically, so you don't have to have a large empty room to assemble it. It seems about as sturdy as the old one. My one complaint is that the same colors aren't available - the other two square IKEA storage shelves I have are both a natural wood color, which is not available in this type.;Easier assembly - Positive, vertical design - Positive, similar sturdiness - Neutral, color availability - Negative.

Difficult to Put Together. I bought this to use in my classroom for storage behind my desk. The directions for assembly are very confusing- I ended up putting pegs in the wrong holes and then was not able to get them out because they were so tight- the pegs are made out of wood and one ended up breaking.

Missing piece. Bought this KALLAX shelving 3 weeks ago as I was moving and needs new nightstand. This was going to work perfectly. After the move I opened the box and began to assemble it. To my dismay, one of the boxes is missing a pretty important piece-the divider for the top shelf! I have tried calling for customer service but was never able to talk to a human and was hung up on by the automatic system. I attempted to do email as well but could never get through.

Bookcase perfection. I love these bookcases. They're elegant and yet simple. They offer seemingly infinite storage, and yet can be used as an airy room divider when placed behind the sofa.

Decent shelving unit but not great. I bought 2 of these kallax unit shelves and for most people whose handy, it may be easy to assemble. I on the other hand, had to manually use my own screwdriver with whatever physical power I had...which it wasn't easy. Paper instructions are sucky as they only show pictures and don't actually give you any additional details of what you're supposed to do. It's basically trail and error kind of thing. You either get it right or you don't. I've had to take it apart and start over because it wasn't the right side or end...and that's with following the directions. Also the wooden dowels can easily go into the holes too deep or break if you're not careful. Once you manage to put everything together, it's pretty sturdy. I don't know about everyone else but I am not kidding when I say that it took me about 4 1/2 hours for one and another hour for the other one. This review is not to scare anyone from buying the unit but it's my way of trying to inform purchasers so they can make a more informative decision. It's really a nice looking shelf once it's done but unfortunately I didn't have the luxury of paying IKEA to assemble it for me so I had to do it myself.;Decent shelving unit - neutral, Manual assembly - negative, Trail and error instructions - negative, Pretty sturdy - positive, Nice looking shelf - positive, Took 4.

uneasy feeling. It is beautiful, light, sturdy, but the corner hardware to attache it to the wall appears to be insufficient.

Great storage!. I bought the glossy white unit because I noticed it wears much better on the displays in the store. With a toddler and another on the way, I need my furniture to hold up to as much abuse as possible. The unit is pretty and easy to assemble. My only complaint is that one of the internal shelves was damaged during production. I thought I'd be able to hide it since it's an internal shelf so I put the whole thing together but it's still visible. I need to put a storage bin in that cubie so it doesn't show but really am unhappy every time I see. The unit is too big and heavy to bring back to the store to exchange.

Good but needs quality control. I bought 2 of these shelves for my kids playroom to replace an older expedit shelf that we moved to my son's room. The first shelf had 2 different pieces that had defects in the outer veneer, if I had seen them before I started building it then I would have returned it but I did not want to deal wuth the hassel of dragging it in (w/ my 2 small kids)to exchange it. Was able to readjust so the defects were on one side and just put that against the wall. Was very disappointed to see these shelves went on sale a week after I bought them... I couldnt get to the store for a price adjustment in time. Also, one of the shelves had double dowel assembly and the other only had single dowels... just strange that they weren't consistent. But overall, love the design and ease of assembly of these shelves!;Replaced older shelf - neutral, sturdy shelves - Positive, defects in outer veneer - Negative, readjusted shelves - neutral, disappointed with sale - Negative, inconsistent dowel assembly - Negative, love design, ease of assembly - Positive.

love the design but the back is not glossy white. I searched all over to see images or get info on whether the backs of the inserts are the same as the front, so when you use it as a room divider it has the same finish on both sides. I had to go to the store and find a cabinet with inserts and pull it away from the wall to see what it looked like. The birch finish is birch --- so I assumed the glossy white would be glossy white -- and it is NOT! It is plain white melamine. So now it will look tacky to have the inserts facing both ways. Otherwise, I'm glad these inserts are available to make the cabinet look more sophisticated, just wish they had not failed on this detail.;Love the design - Positive, back not glossy white - Negative, wished for consistent finish - Negative, checked in-store - Neutral, plain white melamine finish - Neutral.

Long Time. Don’t get me wrong I love the shelf. But it was very hard to put together. As I hammered the shelf was falling a part. Once I stared using a rubber pad in between the wood and the hammer it was much easier to put together. But at the very top I would change the directions. To stand it up then finish putting it together.;Love the shelf - Positive, hard to put together - Negative, used rubber pad - Positive, directions should be changed - Neutral.
Great for closets. We bought six of these units over the past couple of months to customize our closets.

Arguably the Best Shelving System for Vinyl. I bought two of these 2 x 4 Kallax shelving units, as well as an additional 2 x 2 Kallax unit and 10 matching Door Inserts for my record collection. I spent a LONG time researching these shelves: how many records they could hold without risking ring wear, if records would fit inside the Door Inserts (they do), etc., before pulling the trigger, but am so glad I did.  They look amazing in my study, and the shelves themselves show no signs of bowing under the weight of the vinyl. Finish is a rich, almost-black brown, and easy to wipe clean. Very sturdy, and relatively easy to assemble - it took longer to install the Door Inserts I purchased separately than it did to install the shelves. A very versatile, quality product that gives you peace of mind knowing your collection is well-housed. Definitely recommend.;Best shelving system for vinyl - Positive, Holds records safely - Positive, Fits door inserts - Positive, Sturdy construction - Positive, Easy to wipe clean - Positive, Versatile - Positive, Quality product - Positive.

Not as hard as others advise.

Looks great!. Kallax holds a lot of miscellaneous things in the living room and keeps them neat. I have two at my office at work and two at home.

would love deeper drawers. I love the drawer options for the KALLAX units and have 9 sets between 4 KALLAX units. They were easy to put together and install.

KALLAX for my crafts. This piece solved the problem for storing craft materials, especially yarn. Six Drona “bins” are in use, four with various yarns, sorted by weight/type. Two spaces were left open for decorative purposes. This is a great addition to my “office,” which had previously been a nursery/office.  Assembly instructions might have been better if they advised using a soft headed mallet, not a hammer, or perhaps suggest use of a board to protect the piece when pounding it together.;Stores craft materials - Positive, six bins in use - Positive, great addition to office - Positive, assembly instructions unclear - Neutral.

Nice design and finish, Poor construction. The large 4 x 4 kallax shelf unit is only held together with wood dowels and long screws that go into particle board... so it wobbles sideways a bit. It doesn't have the metal and screw attachments that many other Ikea furniture has. I want to use it as a room divider so the end must be anchored to a wall so it doesn't collapse under the weight of the contents. A lot of storage space for the price, and it has a nice clean design.

Perfect!. I have a slide in closet and I have so many clothes and not enough room to put it I could not find a way to keep my clothes organized properly so I change my doors to bifold so I can see my whole wardrobe. Then I’ll put the shelf inside. The measurements are EXACT. I was hoping it would be slightly smaller like one of the comments said but yes it was exact size so I had a little bit of trouble putting it into the closet but when I got it in omg. My stuff has been so organized since no more mess or digging through boxes to find my clothes. I love that I’m able to now stuck my clothes in the bins and have each individual been separate for clothes. It’s also worth the money because My friend suggested to just buy individual squares and put my bins in but they’re normally around $20 each and if I got 8 of them you would be paying over $180 easily that way. But this only $69 and with bins it was like $110.

Awesome storage unit!. Bought this unit for toy storage. I was a bit frustrated when I brought it home to find that we were missing a small piece ( a small wooden dowel). We couldn’t finish the unit without it and seeing as we live 30-40mins away I wasn’t about to drive back to our nearest IKEA. I’m also nesting so I didn’t want to wait for the piece to arrive in the mail, I just needed to finish it ASAP. Luckily we were able to find a replacement piece at our local ACE hardware store. I also noticed a small chip in one of the boards, it’s not very noticeable unless you know it’s there.

Easy to put together, multiple uses. I've purchased so many IKEA Kallax units I can put the 2x4 unit together in my sleep. They're multi-functional and come in so many different colors.

used to be good. This was our third Kallax unit to buy - we liked the first two and with a move to a new house, we thought one more would fit just fine. And it did. But. This time the quality was not as good as before. One of the edges wasn't glued properly and was afar from the body right out of the box. I don't know how to avoid this. I definitely won't take the unit apart and drive it back to the IKEA store another 50 miles just to replace the defective part. But it's not even an option to open the box and check all the parts in the store... So... The product is fine but just be prepared for lowering quality.

Looks Decent Practical, but NOT Easy as Expected. I bought it about a month ago. Had it delivered through a 3rd-party delivery service. I assembled it with the help of my wife. Assembly wasn't as easy as I expected, not because the instructions were complicated, but because this piece is quite heavy to handle. My recommendation is to secure 3 people to do it.

Customize the Kallas. I have an 8-square black-brown Kallax unit, and filled the top row with 4 of these to conceal our book collection. The bottom row has Branas baskets for toys. Overall, I like the effect, but I wish that there were different options of pull knobs, as these tiny metal ones don't go with my decor. Not a huge issue, though.

Broken out of the box. Today we drove 1.5 hrs to our local Ikea to purchase this unit.

So Many Options. I love the glossy white finish I chose, as well as the many options available to customize the unit. Right now I am using it with all open cubbies but I've started a list for additional parts to make it exactly what I need. The only down side was assembly. It wasn't bad, and I have assembled many many products over the years, but until I was about 1/4 of the way through, I did chip the finish off some of the shelves (caused by trying to squeeze dowels into some very tight holes). It was minor, but still annoying.

Then another few weeks later, I came back to get a particular sideboard but find they were out of stock and decided to use this shelf again with some added drawers and doors and it worked out perfectly!

KALLAX are the best bookcases ever. The book case is a complete success. I marvel at the packing and packaging, all those pieces in 2 flat but long boxes. My daughter and I got them home and into the garage. We are rather elderly so my husband opened the boxes and took the pieces downstairs where we wanted the book case placed. Once all the pieces were downstairs, putting the book case together was just a matter of screws and pegs. It all fit together marvelously and I asked 2 nice construction worker from the next door remodel to come set it upright and put it against the wall.

Requires drilling 6 screws into hard wood dividers. They look fine, but installing them in any position that isn't against one of the hollow-core sides is a huge pain.

"I made a bar out of it: it's sturdy, easy to clean. I would highly recommend this shelf! I like this one so much, for the unusual purpose I use it, I am getting several more Kallax. We are going to make more room in our humble abode by going more vertical with shelving. We are going to buy several larger, taller shelves, of varying sizes, for different spots in the house. I know they will hold up! Several years ago, I was shopping alone at an Ikea. I had driven, for a different reason, a few hours from home to a city that had a store; I decided to spend my evening at Ikea (the meatballs called me). We had been considering adding a small counter near the dining table, in our kitchen-dining area. Brainstorming about what we might need for the house, I recalled the counter idea. I looked at several items, but I thought this Kallax shelf (in white) could be the right fit as a modest bar counter with storage. It worked out just as I had hoped! I placed this along the wall of our kitchen-dining area, under a window, opposite all of the kitchen counters. It fit below the window sill perfectly. Since I don't keep much liquor around, there would be room to store other things. So, to store whatever we wanted, without having to look at it, I included a few seagrass baskets (the Knipsa). While it's a nontraditional use, as a simple bar, this shelf has worked out very well! We have had it for about three years now. It is very easy to clean, and at 13 inches and change, each shelf is large enough to hold every alcohol bottle we've had, except some artful, tall wine bottles. The shelves are very sturdy, and the top is fine for preparing a drink, keeping mixing sticks and shot glasses, drinking glasses, and a bit of decor. It's almost the height of most tables, so it works out really well as a counter, instead of a mere shelf.";Sturdy - Positive, Easy to clean - Positive, Recommended - Positive, Large shelves - Positive, Unusual use as a bar - Neutral, Fits below window sill - Positive, Holds alcohol bottles - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive.

Great Shelving For Organizing Just About Anything!. We love these Kallax unit shelves very much and have them in different areas in our house serving different functions. The main one we use the most is a set up of a 2x4 side by side with a 4x4 with a 1x4 across the top of those, and we use them to store our boardgames. The white looks really sharp and makes the board game covers pop. We also have a 2x4 in my daughter's play area and two additional 2x4's in a large storage closet to help keep everything orgainzed.

Looks great but.... Looks great when done, but found out when I was done building it and going to put in a door that one of the sides was on backwards. Can't tell otherwise. However that meant removing the felt pad stickers. The glue on them is so strong that when trying to remove them it peels off the black surface material so once on you can't decide later you want the unit horizontal instead of vertical because you can't take off the pads.;Looks great - Positive, backwards piece - Negative, strong glue - Negative, had to remove felt pads - Neutral.

Great shelf, but not built the way they used to be. Let me start off by saying that when we picked up this shelf at the store, it was well packaged, not damaged, easy to put together and is exactly as pictured with the white one we chose and the cube spaces fit 13x13 organizers perfect. We have always been happy with Ikea products, but found this experience to be a bit disheartening due to quality/durability. We have an identical Kallax shelf that is 7 years old in the black-brown color and the quality (very durable), weight (very solid) and size are DEFINITELY different from the new. At the time we paid $79.99.    With the new one,(we paid $68.99) we noticed the thick edges are almost an inch less on each side compared to the one we have and with that it also makes it about an inch shorter. We thought the cost difference was Ikea's lowering of their prices to a Member's type price like they do on certain products but everything about it remains the same. In this case, the quality changed, but appearance remained.   Had I never owned a Kallax shelf, I would not have noticed this, but we do in this situation. I think this is a great piece for a low traffic area, but with the current materials they used, I wouldn't highly recommend it with high traffic use. The material also doesn't seem as durable, but only time will tell. With the material they used and building it using less overall materials, it also comes with a lesser weight and it just doesn't seem as solid. Although the new one looks great, the overall quality has changed.     This experience hasn't at all deterred us from wanting to go back to Ikea again because we love the store. But, I know that had I known the quality and weight would be so different, I may have looked elsewhere. I hope this helps someone! :);Well packaged - Positive, easy to put together - Positive, exact as pictured - Positive, cube spaces fit organizers - Positive, durability- Negative, lower quality - Negative, less solid - Negative, high traffic area- Neutral, lesser weight - Negative.

Wood pegs don't fit holes. I was expecting these to be more sturdy looking at the pictures. It turns out almost the entire thing is held together with round wooden pegs! Worst of all, those pegs don't fit the holes they are made for properly. Trying to push the shelves onto the wooden pegs doesn't work and if you use a tool to try and get the shelf in further the cheap fake wood dents and the veneer cracks. I recommend you spend your money on a higher quality piece of furniture...;Round wooden pegs - Negative, don't fit holes - Negative, sturdy appearance - Negative, cheap fake wood - Negative, veneer cracks - Negative.

Good quality. These are great cubbies. I would recommend it.;Good quality - Positive.
Looks great. We bought this to use as our bar, and it looks great in our dining room. It gives us a lot more space and the cabinet at the bottom means our bottles don't need to be on display.

Piece of Cake. I went in thinking assembly was going to be a nightmare, a lot of folks seem to express that in the reviews! But it was hyper easy. I think maybe they fumble with the + section in the middle. But as long as you start with the panel marked 1, you can't go wrong. Sturdy. Looks like a built-in. I used a drop of wood glue for each of the dowels to make it extra solid.;Assembly easy - positive, sturdy - positive, looks built-in - positive, easy to assemble - positive, used wood glue - positive.

Fine but..... If you are hoping to use it in combination with an older Kallax style piece, don’t. The size and coloration are different. New one is slightly smaller and more white.

Great for clothes storage. By using this instead of drawers, I found and can easily access all of my clothes.....everything is visible at a glance.

Love the shelf unit, but those inserts?!. I bought the 4x4 Kallax shelf unit to use in my craft room. I absolutely love it. It was easy to assemble by myself, and it fits perfectly in the space I needed it for. I decided to get 2 door inserts and 2 2-drawer inserts, figuring I'd be able to place them wherever and change whenever...ummm, no. Beware, if you decide to go with inserts, you have to screw them in to the sides of the cube you want it in. This will leave you with some ugly holes if you decide to rearrange the placement down the road. I thought I was buying simple inserts that could slide in to the spot, not making a permanent decision that would affect the aesthetic of the shelf unit itself.;Shelf unit - positive, easy to assemble - positive, fits perfectly - positive, door inserts - negative, screw in required - negative, aesthetic impact - negative.

Instead, they work beautifully in my office and are holding office supplies, doubling the space of those shelves;Attractive baskets - Positive, functional - Positive, holds office supplies - Positive, doubled space - Positive.
Good & Not so Good. Love the unit. I have a few, but the 2 I just bought came with inadequate screws. They just wouldn't penetrate the sides of the Kallax unit - tried with 3 manual screw-drivers & my (strong) battery drill. Ended up using longer self-piercing screws which worked beautiful.

Great shelf... once it's all put together. This shelf is great... now that we have it up. Putting it up was so difficult. You really have to follow the directions closely, which is fine, but the last piece (the back piece) didn't fit at all. We had to saw off a 1/4 inch piece off the top in order to make it work (and before we did that, we broke it a bit trying to get it to fit). SO frustrating!;Great shelf - Positive, Difficult assembly - Negative, Instructions needed to be followed closely - Neutral, Broken piece during assembly - Negative, Back piece didn't fit - Negative.
Nice addition to my Kallax unit. This insert took my Kallax unit to the next level. I'm not one to read instructions, so it took me a little longer than I'm sure it was supposed to.

Now own 6 of these. Roomy cubes for books and toys. Be sure to get the back panel in the right way (bevels must fit all the way into the channel).

Not logical or aesthetically pleasing but the only way the fourth side of the box will go on.;Six units purchased - Neutral, Roomy cubes - Positive, bevels assembly requirement - Negative, back panel - Neutral.
Clean Lines. I like the look and simplicity of the Kallex shelf. I have one that I bought about 6 years ago. It looks more expensive and sturdier than this newer model.

Wonderful shelf but you will need a buddy to help. This is a pretty solid shelf unit. We are using ours as a room divider on carpet and it's not wobbly at all. I really love how deep the individual cubbies are too. One thing to note is that if you want to use the fabric cubes, you will need ones that are deep (or just leave a gap in the back). I made a happy mistake buying pretty ones that were exactly the height and depth I needed. Also, you will need a buddy to build this. I tried to build it by myself and there is no way. You will need someone to brace the shelf and someone to push the shelf. Trust me...this will make building it faster and easier.

Fjallbo Shelf Unit is great for potted plants.. I use this shelf for my plant collection. I like that the mesh shelves allow for air ventilation and light to travel through. Putting it together is not hard. You will need a Phillips screwdriver and a little bit of patience to line things up. The very top shelf is solid wood without any pre-drilled holes.

Best Improvement Ever. Whoever dreamt up these drawer inserts deserves a raise! LOVE THEM. They add a whole world of organizing possibilities and really make the KALLAX units multi-functional. *Tip: add a bit of wood glue when putting the side rails on the drawers. If you've owned IKEA items with drawers before, you know that the rails can sometimes come loose or break. Adding the wood glue provides extra stability and they handle weight much better.;Drawer inserts - Positive, multi-functional - Positive, add organizing possibilities - Positive, easy assembly - Neutral, tip for added stability - Neutral.
Easy to assemble, sturdy, and looks great!. My husband had no trouble assembling the bookcase (which cannot be said for several other IKEA items we've purchased that were more difficult). It is very sturdy and looks fantastic (soooo much nicer than particle-board bookcases we have bought in the past). We chose to use it horizontally as a toy cubbie for our son, and we bought the corresponding DRÖNA boxes/bins.;Easy to assemble - Positive, sturdy - Positive, looks great - Positive, good assembly experience - Positive, suitable for toy cubbie - Positive.
Perfect fit. I traded out my traditional dresser for this unit and I couldn't be happier. Fits wonderfully in the space and makes the room look larger!;Fits wonderfully - Positive, makes room look larger - Positive.
Hate the exposed screws. Like the shelf unit, it was easy to assemble. I don’t understand why the screws are exposed on the top. I’m using this more for decoration than hard core storage so maybe that’s why it bothered me enough to write a review.;Dislikes exposed screws - Negative, easy assembly - Positive.
Ok. Harder to put together than anticipated, the instructions aren't very clear. They also don't hold as much as I wanted, the shelves are either too big for one item or too small when you try to double up on items. Bit odd;Harder to put together than anticipated - Negative, instructions not clear - Negative, hold capacity not as expected - Negative, shelves size odd - Neutral.
Perfect. I bought this after thinking about it for a while. I'm so happy I took the leap. It's perfect, easy to put together and easy to clean.;Bought product - Neutral, Perfect - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, easy to clean - Positive.
Classy organizer. I was drawn to the gold color and the interesting structure of this organizational item. I didn’t realize it is designed for a specific shelf, which i do not have, so I am not sure how well it will be utilized in my home but I am trying to come up with a creative solution. I hope sometimes similar releases soon that can be for any shelf.;Gold color - Positive, interesting structure - Positive, designed for specific shelf - neutral, trying to find alternate usage - neutral.
Broke 2 trying to put them together. Like someone else on this thread, I registered just so that I could warn you about this unbelievably frustrating product. There are no normal screws or the usual IKEA dowels on this. Instead, you must line up some very poorly cut holes with these plastic widgets and then force them down into the narrower part of the hole. But if you use any force whatsoever to get them to line up, the plastic wedges snap -- and there is no other way to put them together. I bought three and broke two in a row. I'm not even going to try the third. I'm returning all three tomorrow. For context, I've assembled at least a dozen other IKEA pieces in the past, and I've got 2 Master's degrees. Not sure what sort of training you need to put these EKET cubes together, but I don't have it. I cannot recommend against this product strongly enough.;Broken 2 shelves - negative, unbelievably frustrating product - negative, plastic widgets - negative, forced assembly - negative, poorly cut holes - negative.

Last piece won't fit. Got the unit assembled exactly as per the instructions, but the last piece absolutely will not go in with the back board in place. Taking it apart again broke the fitting off one piece as well as splintered the holes around another. Looks good in the showroom, but not sturdy enough to be dismantled. Can't recommend it.;Last piece won't fit - negative, exactly as per instructions - neutral, splintered holes - negative, can't recommend it - negative.
Great closet organizer. This is my second, stacked on top of the first. Great for organizing my closet.;Great closet organizer - Positive, stacked on top - Neutral.
Poorly Designed. Good appearance, works well. Came with small damage on surface, but this is ok for me. The only thing I cannot accept is that the shelf is suuuuuuper difficult to assemble. It is extremely hard to insert small wood sticks into holes on board, which makes the wood sticks so easy to snaps. Thank to the stupid wood stick, my finger got hurt. I hate this design, indeed. Why don't you just give more screws?;Good appearance - Neutral, works well - Positive, came with small damage - Neutral, difficult to assemble - Negative, fingers hurt - Negative, poorly designed - Negative.

Great for small storage. Purchased this to add to a 2x4 Kallax in the walnut effect color. Didn't realize how glossy the high gloss white would be, but it looks nice (reminds me of a white board). Pretty easy to assemble (~20min), and the drawers glide nicely. Had to screw it into the Kallax, so if we ever want to change the location or flip the orientation of the shelf, we'll have to figure out how to cover up the holes. We did not pre-drill holes and it worked okay. Also, there are markings on the top edge of the drawer for the material type/recyclability that I assumed were a peel off adhesive, but they are not. Pretty ugly since that's what you see every time you open the drawer. Not sure why that wouldn't be in a less visible spot.;Small storage solution - Neutral, Glossy high-gloss white - Neutral (positive for some, negative for others), Easy assembly - Positive, Drawers glide nicely - Positive, Had to screw into Kallax - Neutral, Markings on top of drawer - Negative.

the high gloss white laminate can shatter and chip. I'm a fan of the old Expedit bookcases - I have two in birch and they've held up quite well. This is my first time trying Kallax and my experience has been a bit mixed. While the price is excellent, I'd rather pay a little more and get a higher quality unit like Expedit. While the basic look and feel is similar to Expedit, I'm disappointed there isn't a birch option. I went with the high-gloss white and it has some issues. First off, the edges all come wrapped in protective tape that's a real bear to remove. Second, the laminate shatters to pieces when your hammer strays even a tiny bit off the mark during assembly. I get it - it's my fault that I don't use a hammer most days so my aim is off, but the result is that my new shelf unit doesn't look so new. I just hope the damaged areas don't flake off any further.;High gloss white laminate - Neutral, priced well - Positive, finished product appearance - Negative, edges protected with tape - Neutral, laminate prone to shattering - Negative.
Great Addition to Help with Storage Issue. I just assembled this shelf. It took les than 2 hours for two people together. Nice and sturdy. I think it is good quality and attractive. I was concerned it would look cheap, but it looks real nice. I am happy with my purchase.;Assembled shelf - neutral, 2 hour assembly time - neutral, sturdy - Positive, good quality - Positive, attractive - positive, not cheap - positive.
good idea. but didn't really work. the screws require extra steps to actually get into the shelf sides. Read nail first, then a bigger screw, finally the screw that comes in the package. also, my door doesn't really close. kind of pops out beyond the shelving unit. positive - you can easily remove the back of the insert if you want to use that shelf for something with cords.;Screws require extra steps - Negative, door doesn't close properly - Negative, back of insert removable - Neutral.
Best modular furniture build yet. I've put together hundreds of modular furniture pieces and this one is by far the best planned and executed I've ever seen. Instead of using lots of weak screw connections this uses dowels (I love to add glue to them) that have better holding power and are cheaper to provide, easier to install and last longer. The instructions used no text to explain the process and were extremely easy to follow. The overall sturdiness and solidarity of this furniture is far and above the rest. It comes in 4 boxes which also make carting it around much easier to do.;Best modular furniture - Positive, well planned - Positive, executed well - Positive, uses dowels - Positive, clear instructions - Positive, sturdy and solid - Positive.

Great item.. I love the Kallax. It took me a couple minutes to realize there was a protective film on the sides of the shelves, top and bottom. Was relatively easy to put together but it is best to have 2 people do this. I didn't like that the dowels had to be hammered through the shelf and the hammer caused a little minor damage...nothing noticeable unless you know it's there. Best to try to use a rubber mallet maybe. But all in all, I really like it. I plan on buying some inserts but haven't gotten that far yet.;Protective film - neutral, Easy to put together - Positive, best to have 2 people - neutral, minor hammer damage - negative, plans to buy inserts - neutral.
Low quality and weird fit. These are easy to assemble. However, you need to screw them to the Kallax shelves. So, as others have mentioned, once they are in, they are in. My drawers did not slide in in such a way that they are level or that did not leave a gap at the top or the bottom. I had purchased two. One is going back, one is going in the trash.;Easy to assemble - Positive, low quality - Negative, weird fit - Negative, screws to Kallax shelves - Neutral, drawers did not slide in smoothly - Negative.
Don't worry, you can do it too.. In spite of the negative reviews by a couple of others, the Eket CAN be put together successfully. Just follow the pictorial instructions, and use your brain a little. What you end up with is a very structurally sound cabinet that is PERFECT for LP records! When the back is slid in, the top piece put on, and the clips inserted into the holes behind the back panel, the enclosure becomes very stiff and stable, unlike the somewhat wobbly Kallax, which has no back panel. I love the Eket!;Can be put together - Positive, structurally sound cabinet - Positive, perfect for LP records - Positive, follows pictorial instructions - Positive, stiffer than Kallax - Positive, love the Eket - Positive.

Easy on the eyes and functional. Bought this for pantry storage in my kitchen and I love the industrial look! Even though it's not super sturdy (not heavy steel), it's sturdy enough to do the job.  I suggest reading the instructions thoroughly before assembling. I was able to put it together in about an hour with a few mistakes (not reading the instructions) along the way.

Walk-In Closet & Laundry Room. A great solution for my new walk-in closet and for my laundry room! I bought a total of 10 Kallax shelving units - I used 3 of the 2 wide x 4 tall units (standing vertically) and topped them each with a 2 wide x 2 tall unit.  I used double hanging rods between them.  I used the last of the 2 wide x 2 tall horizontally and hung it to be level with the center 2 sections of the vertical unit. I added drawer inserts and purchased jewelry organizers for them -- then added a vanity mirror and a rack for hanging long necklaces and WOW -- a great closet for almost no money. (I did buy quality cabinet knobs for the drawers to replace the small/ugly modern ones).  The 1 wide x 4 tall units went into my laundry room (with door fronts), so I can neatly organize & store all the cleaning and ironing items. They look great and hold so much! (Again, bought quality knobs for the door fronts) Lastly, I'd like to say that I assembled all of these and attached them to the wall by myself -- I'm a small senior female, so if I can do it, anyone should be able to. I really like the way the directions are presented -- the drawings make everything very clear and simple to follow. In all, a great experience -- the worst part is schlepping to IKEA to get the units vs having them delivered (IKEA -- you need to talk to Amazon to make online shopping/delivery easy and affordable). I really love the look and the functionality of my closet and my laundry room, and my friends are just amazed!;Walk-in closet solution - Positive, great experience - Positive, clear directions - Positive, functional - Positive, holds much - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, affordable - Positive, amazed friends - Positive.

Changed size. We bought this shelving unit a few years ago and love it.  We decided to get another one to go next to the one we already have.  You would think it would be the same, but no. For some reason Ikea thought it would be a good idea to change the width of the outside edges and now they are not the same height.  So be sure to double check every little detail if you are trying to match something new to something you already have.  Even if it's the same thing, it might be different.;Bought shelving unit - positive, love it - positive, tried to buy another - neutral, sizes changed - negative.

Much harder to put together than I thought. I've put a lot of Ikea furniture together over the years. This Kallax 2 X 4 unit was probably the most difficult piece I've had to do. Granted, the instructions call for 2 people and I did it by myself, but the main problem was the wooden dowels were too big for the holes and it was incredibly hard to get the pieces to go together. Also, the MDF in this piece seems more fragile than usual, and pieces of it crumbled off while I was working on it. And the directions for attaching the caster wheels are incomprehensible and contain incorrect information. I had to watch a YouTube video to figure out what to do. Now that the piece is together I love it. But I would not buy another one because of how unpleasant the assembly was. On a positive note, I also bought the Kallax 1 X 4 and that was a breeze to assemble. I'll buy more of those!;Difficult assembly - Negative, instructions unclear - Negative, wooden dowels too big - Negative, MDF pieces fragile - Negative, caster wheel attachment unclear - Negative, unpleasant assembly experience - Negative, easy assembly (Kallax 1 X 4) - Positive, love finished product - Neutral.

Very sturdy shelf - repurchasing!. A year ago, I helped pick out this shelf for my roommate to purchase for our living room. It functions very well as a TV stand. We purchased the dröna boxes to go in the bottom 4 spaces. We use the top 4 spaces for our electronics like the wifi router and Apple TV. The shelf is of surprisingly good quality and much sturdier than I expected. Assembling took two people and about 15 minutes. Now that I'm moving, I'm buying the same unit to use at my new apartment. I offered to buy the existing unit from my roommate but they also really loved it and are taking it to their new place.

Worst IKEA project ever!. I’ve purchased too many IKEA projects to count, some of them much more complicated than the EKET cabinet. This should have been a straight forward assembly, but it wasn’t because the hardware was out of true, the panels would never line up correctly and, in the end, it wasn’t stable enough to use for anything.;Worst IKEA project - Negative, out of true hardware - Negative, unaligned panels - Negative, unstable - Negative.
So in love with these!. I have 3 of these in my home now. They are so sturdy and I love the insert options for them. I use them to store craft stuff in my sewing room and in my bedroom I have one for bathroom storage and one for general storage. My bathroom is so small and has no storage so I set this up just out side the door and it holds all my towels, makeup, hair stuff, and all manner of girly products. This only takes about 30-40 min. to put together but you really should have 2 people. If you push to hard without someone pushing back you could break it.;Three units - neutral, love the inserts - positive, multiple uses - positive, sturdy - positive, easy assembly - neutral, 30-40 min.

So long to put together!!. I really think this piece is beautiful but in good old Ikea fashion it was missing pieces and it was defective but the piece that was defective was on the 2 to last step so I would have never noticed it. It too filing and some hammer to get off the extra weld that was on said part and it took me several hours to put together. Mind you I am only one person so a second pair of hands would have been helpful. Also if i had all the parts (not needing to do surgery or go to the hardware store) it may have taken and hour or 2 to put together. I gave it four stars because of the price and the look. But beware my fellow Ikea shoppers give yourself some time; Beautiful piece - Positive, Missing pieces - Negative, Defective part - Negative, Long assembly process - Negative, Took several hours - Negative, Required additional tools - Negative.

It holds things.. If you want to have your things off the ground, then that Kallax certainly does the job.;Holds things - Positive, off the ground storage - Positive.
Great drawer...but small. This accessory for the KALLAX is okay. It’s more difficult to assemble than I thought and you have to drill it into the main unit. So make sure you’re sure on where you want it.  The drawers work well and very smooth to open and close, but very small.  I like the wire basket and shorter under basket for more storage.  It is a nice accessory if it works for you.;Difficult assembly - Negative, draws work well - Positive, small drawers - Negative, required drilling - Negative, like wire basket - Positive.
Great product, but..... Product is great as long as you don’t hang it floating on the wall.

Sturdy storage. This shelf happens to be one of my favorite IKEA pieces. I was originally going to buy the 16 slot shelf, however it was out of stock so I went with the nine slot shelf.

Love these!. I use my Kallax to store metal stamping supplies. These drawers are fantastic. They open and close much more smoothly than pretty much any other piece of furniture I have. I have a couple of drawers full of stamp sets, which are basically blocks of solid metal. The drawers glide open and closed just like they were empty and don't have trouble with the weight at all. I'd recommend these to anyone!;Love these - Positive, metal stamping supplies - neutral, fantastic drawers - Positive, smooth opening - Positive, recommend these - Positive.
Not nearly as nice as they used to be.. We had bought Kallax series shelves in the early days of Ikea's arrival in the U.S. and up in to the early 2000s. Back then the products were well made and very reasonably priced. Now, all they are is cheap. We were very disappointed in the drop in quality of these shelving units. I would much rather pay a little more and get the same quality they used to have than buy something just plain cheap in price and quality. We still have several of our old units that we've moved from home to home and room to room. They've withstood the wear and tear. These new ones definitely won't. The hollow core sides, the thinner shelves and cheaper chip board are not hearty enough to withstand assembly, let alone use! I had to be extra careful after tapping a wood peg into one of the holes and it push out the wood on the other side of the exterior wall. The chip board was already flaking from the ends of the shelf boards and easily flaked as the pegs were tapped in. The color was rubbed off or not painted to the edges of several of the shelves. Very, very disappointed in this product and Ikea's obvious reduction in quality.;Well-made (early units) - Positive, reasonable price (early units) - Positive, not nice (current units) - Negative, cheap (current units) - Negative, hollow core sides - Negative, thinner shelves - Negative, cheaper chip board - Negative, easy assembly damage - Negative, color not to edges - Negative, not hearty enough - Negative, flaking chip board ends - Negative, disappointed (product and brand
Good for the price. Looks better than it should. It was difficult to put the dowels in place with a hammer. A little bit too much hammering to get the dowels in place caused some of the wood to chip off. Still looks good though.;Good value - Positive, looks better than expected - Positive, difficult to place dowels - Negative, wood chipped during assembly - Neutral.
perfect for library storage. I use two of these as storage for my home library and they are perfect! They are incredibly easy to put together (although you put them together on their side and then have to lift them upright and they are HEAVY. Definitely don't skip the step with the looped strap). I've had my original one for three years and it still looks brand new.;Library storage - Positive, incredibly easy to assemble - Positive, looks brand new - Positive, sturdy - Positive, skip step with looped strap - Neutral.

Perfect shelf for small plants. This shelf is great in my sunroom to keep my plants more organized. The height between shelves is enough for plants in 4-6 inch containers, and the clear glass let’s more light through to the lower layers.

Great storage for vintage record albums. This is the second shelf we’ve purchased. First time it was the larger one we purchased.

Look good, work well. I’m organizing my studio and these storage units are just great for that. They look so clean and neat and are so useful. The 15” cubical openings fit almost any size book and adding bin inserts and drawer inserts makes spaces perfect for storage of awkward odds ends. Is the quality great? No, but good enough.

Just what I needed. Actually purchased two of these units in white and one in dark brown. One now has the wheels on it and the other is stationary. The one with the wheels has a painted back on it -- an iKea hack -- and coordinates with cabinets I built. The other is part of an office set up and is sleep, offers storage (with iKea drawers) and iKea boxes to fit in the spaces.

Nice design. Hit or miss with quality.. The first Kalisz I bought was wonderful.

Should have paid more attention. I bought this to hang from the top of my 2x2 Kallax with doors on the bottom. I didn't pay attention to the fact that it will only hang from the narrow middle ledge.

Great for random storage in a small space. I bought this unit to tuck into a small wall in my sewing room. It's perfect to hold my notions and equipment without taking up too much room. My only wish is that it was taller -- maybe a 5x3 squares version. I know I can add a 2x3 piece on top, but I'm not loving the idea of the double-thick edge that would give me.;small space storage - positive, holds notions and equipment - positive, taller unit preferred - neutral, 5x3 squares version - neutral, can add 2x3 piece - neutral.
Solid construction but white is easily scuffed. I bought six of these several months ago for use in my home office. They are solidly built and were easy to assemble (though a power drill/driver is helpful, as is a second person to help manipulate some of the larger pieces). It was relatively straightforward to get multiple units aligned so that they are all the same height, and look coordinated.  Yet, after a few months of use, the white surface has become scuffed from use. In general, the matte wood surfaces are difficult to clean, as it is not perfectly smooth and absorbs cleaning spray (so dusting with a damp cloth doesn't work well). I've been unable to get the scuffs off (they come from books being used, staplers and other office stuff being shifted around - so produced from just mild usage). So, I'm expecting to paint these within a year of purchase to freshen them up (and seal the surface for easier cleaning!).;Solidly built - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive, Difficult to clean white surface - Negative, Scuffed easily - Negative, Will paint - Neutural.

It matched perfectly with our wall unit.. I bought this to go with our wall unit we also bought from IKEA.;Matched perfectly - Positive, bought to match wall unit - Positive.
A Cool Design. I love the design, colors, and size of the piece. Assembly wasn't hard. I used an electric drill to very carefully pre-drill the holes for the many screws attaching the two wood shelves to the frame. I was surprised that screw holes weren't already pre-drilled. It would have been a challenge for me to get the screws in straight without pre-drilling. I was disappointed that the lower metal shelf bowed when I put a box filled with scrapbooking paper and supplies on it. I'd thought the metal shelf would be stronger. I took several things out of the box and stored them elsewhere, so I wouldn't permanently bow the shelf.;Design - Positive, colors - Positive, size - Positive, Assembly - Neutral, Used electric drill - Neutral, Disappointed - Negative, metal shelf - Neutrical, Bowed - Negative.

Great. These shelves are perfect for everything. They are sturdy and look great. I bought another shelf to put right next to a shelf I bought exactly a year ago.

Great shelf unit, but wall anchor system is poor!. Assembly of the shelf unit was easy. The unit is quality. However, we use it in vertical mode. This requires wall anchoring. The provided anchor system does not reach the wall. The designers have not accounted for floor molding. The anchors need to have adjustable positions so the anchor can be attached to the wall. As is you probably will have to design your own adapter blocks to attach to the wall. Looks like IKEA has not learned from their tip over problems.;Easy assembly - Positive, Quality unit - Positive, poor wall anchor system - negative.

Great Flexible Storage. I bought this for storage in my guest room used mainly by my young grandchildren. The room is tiny. The scale is perfect and it is sturdy and attractive.

it has been out of stock for more than 9 weeks!!!!. I like the color and quality for the price the reason why I give only 2 stars is: I bought this kallax shelf unit in walnut gray effect color I could purchase 1 because they did not have more at that time in Sunrise FL, so I was like no problem I will buy the rest and I will finish my bedroom set in 1-2-3 weeks when they will have it in stock again. well I am still waiting it has been like that for more than 9 weeks now. I am actually really considering to return my self unit and buy my bedroom set from another store. it is ridiculous. I check the store availability in every 4 days. I was planning to order the rest 2 units online but they charged 110 dollars for delivery and they do not have a local pick up option if I order it. I called them and of course they do not know when they will have it again in stock. such a shame! please fix the problem.;Out of stock for 9 weeks - Negative, bought one unit - Neutral, waiting for availability - Negative, colored walnut gray - Neutral, delivery charge - Negative, local pick up option - Negative.

Solid Piece. We set this up and threw some small slanted legs we found online to the bottom and it looks fantastic! Perfect organization for our kids toys. I would give 5 stars, but when it's set up horizontally you can see the bolts on the sides.

Good if you need drawers, but flimsy sides. We purchased the previous version of these drawers which had full board sides.

Awful. So disappointed with the quality. Have same unit from 10 years ago, strong, heavy and sturdy. Took this out of the box and was thin, peeling apart and cheap. Not the IKEA I used to know.

Not consistent with what is used to be in the past.;Disappointed with quality - Negative, thin - Negative, peeling apart - Negative, not consistent with past - Negative, size smaller - Negative.
Terrible delivery service. This isn’t a dig against the product, which overall is great. But rather an expression of my extreme disappointment in IKEA’s delivery methods and customer service. It took well over a month to have a shelf unit delivered to my house after serval terminal delays and the fact the delivery company forgot to load my order onto a truck several times. Both IKEA and the delivery company were indifferent and unwilling to help. I guess all I can say is buy this item in store if you’re serious about owning it in a reasonable timeframe.;Product is great - Positive, delivery service is terrible - Negative.

Looks good but materials lacking. I bought this a month ago for my daughter's dorm room. The laminate peeled on several corners of the shelves when we were assembling. One of the corner holes was not drilled out properly so when the screw went in it pushed material up and created a bubble under the laminate. It would have broken through and created a hole had I not caught it. I was able to turn the shelf so the bubble and peeling laminate are not visible from the front but we know it's there.

Easy to assemble and love the versatility. I had two 4x2 Expedit before and love them.

Looks good, but you get what you pay for. Looks good, seems sturdy, but you get what you pay for. Doors do not align. Issue is that the hinges included for the doors do not allow for alignment (round hole, not slot, as shown in the instruction booklet). Yes, shelf is leveled/squared, but one door attaches and hangs a full 1/4 lower on the frame than the other door, leaving a little space between the middle shelf and the top of the door. The other door is perfect. This problem is not evident until the whole thing is put together (doors go on last). Not worth the trip to return/exchange -- and possibly have the same situation on the next one -- but will not be buying the taller bookshelf to go with it.;Appears sturdy - Positive, Doors misalign - Negative, Hinges round hole - Negative, Leveled shelves - Neutral, Not worth returning - Negative.

One of my favorites!. This is one of my favorite pieces of furniture, probably because it’s so different. The raw industrial look is catchy, and it’s rare to find it for such an affordable price. It’s taking extraordinary willpower not to buy the rest of the set and completely redo my living room in all Fjallbo. The design’s not without flaws though. There are no predrilled holes in the wood shelves for screws. While this isn’t too big of a deal for reasonably handy people, it does mean an extra level of care is needed in assembling if you want everything straight. Also, my doors are not exactly flush with one another. I feel if I were to mess around with the leveling feet a bit, as well as the corner braces, I could get them better situated... but it’s a slight annoyance I’d rather not have to deal with in flat-pack furniture.;Favorite piece - Positive, raw industrial look - Positive, affordable price - Positive, extraordinary willpower required - Neutral, design flaws - Negative, no predrilled holes - Negative, slightly misaligned doors - Neutral, flat-pack furniture - Neutral.

Works great. This isn't the first Kallax shelf I've bought but it's the biggest in this line. The finished product is great, as usual, but this was the hardest one to build so far. We broke two pegs putting it together and had to drill them out. I was extremely lucky that I've saved every extra Ikea peg I've ever gotten and had enough to finish building the shelf - otherwise I'd have been in trouble. My apt isn't big enough to have this thing just sitting around while I wait for spare parts. What I learned is that Ikea needs to have those little wooden pegs more easily available, or possibly include a few extras with every product, not just a few here and there. But like I said, the finished shelf is fine, it works just as well as the others I have.;Biggest Kallax shelf - Neutral, hardest to build - negative, broke pegs - negative, lucky to have spare parts - neutral, finished product is great - positive, includes few wooden pegs - negative.

Love, love, love!. This shelving unit is perfect in my kitchen. I bought 2. I'm using them for my bar/pantry. My house is tight and everything needs a place. This unit corrals all of my stuff. If it doesn't fit on these two shelving units, I don't need it. The color is the exact shade as the paint of my stairs. I couldn't ask for a closer match. I purchased a Hemnes shoe cabinet to go neItxt to it. I'm going to use the paint on the shoe cabinet for a better match. The Havsta shelves have a rail across the back so things don't fall down behind. I'm thinking of cutting out the baseboards behind for a more flush fit. It is super easy to assemble. I did it on my own in less than an hour. The bigger bottom is great for the booze bottles and the food stuffs are up top.

Have two ebony ones horizontally in the living room for TV and media storage, one horizontally in nursery for all baby-stuff. Have used baskets so far, but looking into the additional drawer and door inserts. Even saw blonde wood one being used in an office setting on an Australian TV show.

Great addition to a Studio apartment. I bought this in mind to separate from the living area to my bed area since my Studio is an open floor plan. It is the perfect size for storage without being an eye sore in my apartment, the 4x4 was HUGE. I can mix and match what I store in each of the shelves with IKEA's varying options of shelving inserts.

Looks nice. I got about 3 sets of these drawers to go in 3 shelf units. They are nice and look good.

We use it horizontally, and it fits perfectly in the space. It feels sturdy, and looks more expensive than it was. Assembly took maybe an hour. My only complaint would be the way the dowels connecting the shelves fit. It took a little elbow grease to make them fit.;Exercise equipment storage - neutral, fits perfectly - positive, sturdy - positive, looks expensive - positive, assembly took an hour - neutral, dowels fitting took effort - negative.

Nice Sturdy Unit. A nice sturdy unit that the user can add extra features to like drawers, doors or even tubs. The unit has nice easy instructions to build the unit where almost anybody should easily be able to build them. There are exceptions to this though as a co-teacher was confused immediately upon opening the packaging that she had to hire a contractor to build the units that she had bought. I've bought 3 of this particular style plus I purchased two 4x4 units and a 5x5 unit and all were so easy to build. When you build the 5x5 unit make sure that you have somebody there to lift the unit as it is heavy.;Nice sturdy unit - Positive, add extra features - Positive, easy instructions - Positive, co-teacher hired contractor - Negative, built multiple units - Positive, heavy 5x5 unit - Neutral.

flimsy and wrong screws. I wanted doors, and because we had to get this set up for a client visit we made do. Unfortunate that they sell a good set of shelves then send this cheap stuff out. Short screws (we had to run out and get some that worked) and flimsy cardbord insert means the doors don't work right. After the client meeting we may return but unfortunately there are now holes in the shelving unit.;Sent faulty parts - Negative, short screws - Negative, flimsy cardboard insert - Negative, doors don't work right - Negative.

Just what I wanted. Product works great - was not difficult to assemble. When putting some of the sides together it did require quite a bit of force but nothing too crazy. The product dimensions were not completely accurate. I measured the height of the space I wanted it to go in 3 times and checked against dimensions of this before purchasing and I should have had an extra 1/4 inch of space but instead the cabinet was a little taller than the height of the space I wanted it in. I was still able to use it, but that was a little frustrating.;Product works great - Positive, not difficult to assemble - Positive, required some force - Neutral, dimensions inaccurate - Negative.

Origami construction. I love the Kallax system but despise the origami structure of this. The old ones were sturdy, this however you have to drill into the cabinet, making it impossible to change the location of the doors. The walls are flimsy and the back looks not that good.;Ikea Kallax system - Neutral, Origami structure - Negative, cannot reposition doors - Negative, flimsy walls - negative, back looks not good - Negative.
Quick to assemble, smooth operation. The drawers were nice and quick to assemble (I bought a bunch and did them assembly-line style and they were done in no time!) The bottom of the drawer slides around a bit while you're trying to hammer the plastic bolts into place - a clamp fixed that and actually helped the hammering go faster, too. Screwing it into the Kallax by hand takes a fair bit of oomph - we were doing five of them and by the end both of us were having a lot of trouble turning the screwdriver anymore. An electric driver might be a good idea, if you can get it in there. I liked that guides were included to make sure you got everything to just the right depth and all - I feel like it would have been easy to overlook the detail and make the user deal with it themselves, but they went that extra mile and it looks great. The drawers themselves move perfectly smoothly, and I feel like they also lent a little extra structural stability to the Kallax unit.;Quick assembly - Positive, smooth operation - Positive, easy to assemble drawers - Positive,bottom slides - Neutral, clamped to fix issue- Positive, strong screwing required - Neutral, included depth guides - Positive.
Tricky to put together but easy if you do it right. I bought 5 of them, I took each piece out of the box and assembled them as they came out, the first one went together with no problem. I put the next 2 together in the same order as the first but could not get either one to fit together.  I discovered the problem that a lot of people have had. The pieces are placed in some but not all of the boxes in assembly order. You must start with piece #1 and put the proper 2nd and 3rd piece on each side of it.  When you are doing the 3rd side it is very easy to put the wrong piece on, If you do the final side won't fit.  The problem is that piece # 1 has a deeper slot for the back to fit into. If you assemble # 3 wrong #1 will be on the side, not the back. This will cause the back piece to block the final side from sliding into the holes. After discovering this the next 4 went together in less than 2 minutes each.;Tricky assembly - Neutral, assembly requires order - Neutral, 5 shelves bought - Neutral, proper assembly order - Neutral, easier with experience - Positive.

We love it!. Great storage solution and with the combination of the cubes is awesome!;Great storage solution - Positive, combination with cubes - Positive, we love it - Positive.
Great-looking, versatile shelf system. We originally bought a 2x2 and 4x4 of the Kallax shelf units a few years ago, for our board game collection. In the intervening years, the collection grew and we decided to grab the 5x5. I've also been looking for a place to store all our art and craft supplies, and it dawned on me that one of these would be perfect for that too, so we got a second unit. The old one is now in an office closet, storing the various cords and other electronics and office things we had. The size of each cube is perfect - just large enough to fit everything in a category together, but providing both stability and separateness to bring everything together and make it feel organized. It really works well for all of the uses we put them to! As far as assembly, it came together pretty quickly but is definitely easier as a two-person job. The instructions want you to build it while it's upright, but we had a lot of difficulty getting the long shelves in sideways, so we built on its side to use our weight to help push the shelves down and in and then turned it onto its bottom when it was done. The first one did come out not quite plumb, perhaps, as a result, so do exercise caution if you go this route. We installed drawers across an entire row and that seemed to actually help straighten it out, so it didn't really make much difference. If you need to organize and store some stuff, you pretty much can't go wrong with these units!;Great-looking - Positive, Versatile - Positive, 2x2 and 4x4 - Neutral, 5x5 - Positive, Perfect size - Positive, Stability - Positive, Organization - Positive, Easier with help - Neutral, Improved plumbness - Neutral.
Very nice!. Just what I expected! Only reason I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is because a screw wouldn't go in right no matter what so it ended up being a little slanted. Other than that I love it!; as expected - Positive, love it - Positive, slight issue with screw - Negative.
Very flexible!. I have used these for years in both of my son's rooms and for the living room for almost everything. They work great with and without the baskets and doors. these are one of the best items from IKEA;Used for years - Positive, flexible - Positive, work great without baskets or doors - Positive, best items from IKEA - Positive.

Great style.. I bought this and was kinda nervous about the assembly. But it went together so well. I put it together by myself and only need help to put it into place in the room.

And I can see all my stuff.;Great style - Positive, went together well - Positive, flexible - Positive, holds a lot - Positive, love having everything in one place - Positive.
No top shelf?!. I bought this not realizing that the top section is open - no shelf! Why? It doesn't make sense. I would have happily paid a little more to have a top shelf at that opening.

"NEW SHELVES DON'T MATCH THE OLD SHELVES. FIRST/BIGGEST FRUSTRATION....the 3 Ikeas closest to me College Park, MD; Baltimore, MD and Woodbridge, VA have NOT had the 2 by 2 Kallax birch effect (402.758.13) for at least a month even though it is expected on the next truck.....a bit like Waiting for Godot. SECOND FRUSTRATION I managed to buy one because someone just happen to return one the day I checked. When I put it together THE NEW KALLAX IS SMALLER THAN THE KALLAX I BOUGHT 5 YEARS AGO, so I cannot use the units together. Good news the drawer inserts will still work. I need just one more Kalla (402.758.13). I thought about using a 4x2 Kallax birch effect (502.784.82), however that would leave me with this odd shelf unite that does not match my old shelves and is not useful in my new small space.

"A couple of tips for easier assembly. The holes in the top and bottom are sized so that the screws bite into the wood; so when you screw the top and bottom to the sides, the screws push the two pieces away, no matter how hard you push. The fix is easy: before you put the top and bottom on, drill out the holes a little bit so the screw slides through easily. A 7mm or 9/32 drill bit would be perfect; I didn't have either one of those, so I used a 1/4 and then pounded the screws through with a hammer one time before attaching the top and bottom.  On the subject of pounding, while the wooden dowels can be inserted with a hammer, but a rubber mallet makes it easier to push the pieces into the holes once the wooden dowels are in place.";Easier assembly - neutral, top and bottom pieces - neutral, holes sized for wood - neutral, need to drill holes - neutral, rubber mallet recommended - neutral.

As some one who tried to, I only got 100 feet. I struggled the entire way, I then found a shopping cart, managed to get it in there, then had to push the cart into my car on the loading dock to get the box in there. It was a horrendous experience that was WELL worth it. Also the people who work at Ikea are so friendly but if you go on a Sunday in the late evening, don’t expect any carts because customers don’t return them, so get it before you start through ikea.; LOVE IT - Positive, perfect - Positive, sturdy - Positive, heavy box - Negative, some complaint - Neutorial.

Tedious to put together, but nice overall. I bought and put together two of these. This shelf might be tricky if it's your first time assembling furniture. Because it's metal, the screw holes are inflexible and make it difficult to turn the screws (and using a drill is not recommended). There were over 50 screws to put in for each one, so it took me about an hour for each unit. However, the end result was pretty nice and solid. Oh, also, the top wood part didn't have holes pre-drilled, so you have to make your own--just be careful not to drill all the way through so the hold doesn't show on top.;Tedious assembly - negative, metal shelf - neutral, inflexible screw holes - negative, several screws to put in - negative, solid end result - positive, top wood part lacks pre-drilled holes - negative.

Add style to any modular unit. Decided to try this on a LAPPLAND television unit since the modular sections are 15x15. I bought one for my unit and when installed, is not perfectly flushed with the edge it is off by about 3-4mm, but it is no big issue - I replaced the flimsy knobs with glass handles from home depot and it looks amazing when completed! Like other people have mentioned, and as the instructions direct, you will need a small power tool to easily and properly install the drawer - this is important to take into consideration since not everyone has a tool handy or feels comfortable using one. Also, like others have stated, it is meant for light objects as the base of the drawers is cheap pressed board, but if you are handy with tools, you could easily cut one of the preferred thickness. For me, the whole process took about 40 minutes.;Adds style - Positive, off alignment - Neutral, replaced flimsy knobs - neutral, instructions require small power tool - neutral, meant for light objects - neutral, easy modification - Positive.

Great for Making a Wall Unit. We created a unit that fit our wall perfectly with the narrower open bookshelves and the tall glass door display cabinets. Havsta collection is sturdy and well made and easy to assemble. We love the clean look and the variety in the collection to create the look we wanted to achieve.   The display cabinet has spacer pieces on the back to account for positioning against a wall with baseboards! That was a welcome surprise and really shows the consideration that went into the design.   The spacers were not included for the narrow open shelf though. The anchoring kit for the open shelf does accommodate being set a little away from the wall for baseboards and what not but we still felt more comfortable adding some of our own makeshift spacers to keep the shelf in the right position and not pitching backward.;Wall unit - Positive, narrow shelves - Positive, tall glass door displays - Positive, sturdy and well-made - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, clean look - Positive, spacer pieces for wall unit - Positive, narrow open shelf - Neutral, makeshift spacers for shelf - Neutral.

Great room divider. I was a little daunted by the number of boxes this came in, but myself and my roomate, both all of 5ft tall managed it ok. It was a little harder to assemble than some of the other ikea furniture we have, but not excessively so.

Very sturdy!. IKEA has come so far with their furniture design. Yes, they still have soft pine furniture and if modestly used it holds up great. The KALLAX shelf unit on the other hand is very sturdy. Our household uses things in more of a heavy fashion and my husband shys away from a lot of IKEAS furniture for that reason. I brought this home on my own and the plan is for books and toys. My husband kinda gave me the look, like this may not hold up like you want. I bought two of them because I loved the stores display of one upright and one horizontal. My husband put them together in record time and was very impressed with the quality. Each cube opening is both large and deep. The baskets I was able to put in the openings were almost empty looking compared to the toys overflowing out of my previous storage.

That’s led to a storage problem - bookshelves are too shallow, and other shelves we looked at didn’t have large enough spaces for all the strangely shaped boxes. We picked this up, put it together in an afternoon (heads up - we needed a rubber mallet to help get some of the wooden pegs in place) and it’s been perfect.;Board games shelf - positive, large enough spaces - positive, solid - positive, shallow bookshelves - negative.
love the size. When I brought this home and carried it upstairs one piece at a time (the boxes were to heavy for me to carry by myself) the last piece was crushed on one side. I was devastated. I thought I was going to have to carry everything back down again but after a search on the Ikea website I found out I only had to return the damaged piece. They replaced it with no problem.

Decent for the price. The Kallax is lighter than I expected, and the instructions are not super helpful. If they showed in which direction the raw edges should face, that would have made it easier.

So Disappointed, not like they use to be at all!!. I bought a Kallax about 8 years ago and the door inserts then were all wood and didn't require you to screw into the shelf. I decided I wanted to add 2 more and now they are cardboard and must screw into the shelf permanently damaging it so you can't change it later. They are also much harder to align. VERY disappointed.

Versatile Bookcase with lots of accessories.. This is my second one of these. The first had 25 cubes. This was a lot easier to assemble. As always it fit together precisely and works vertically or horizontally. The accessories (I added lots of drawers) would get tedious unless you use a drill/driver set on low torque. But it was worth it for the finished product. IKEA's bookshelves, cabinets, and anything else you need to assemble looks as good or better than traditional furniture that costs a lot more.

Frustrating assembly. The puzzle from Heck. I've never before had trouble assembling IKEA furniture, but this one threw me for a loop. It's hard to tell which parts are the ones shown in the instructions, and I never did manage to get everything to fit together.

This became a teen hangout, for all her things, her loft bed, couch and game systems. The Kallax puts together so simply.

Very practical. I have almost a dozen of these doors throughout my good, and they are super practical. Yes, I have a *few* Kallax units.

You need to buy these. I love my Kallax shelves. I actually bought five of them in various sizes. So many things I love about these shelves (in no particular order). 1. They look great.

If you get stuck trying to assemble it, you can always find help. 4. The units don't have that annoying particle board backing. I love this because my freshly painted walls aren't covered up by the unattractive backing and it makes it so convenient to plug stuff in. 5. They are so versatile. You can buy fabric totes or drawers or cabinet doors to put in the squares for added flexibility and storage options. This is actually what sold me on these shelves. IKEA sells a cat bed that you can put in the squares (who knew?) and I have one in my Kallax. 6. They are super affordable compared to other cabinets and storage units.

So roomy!. I love it! This unit is very stylish but so practical! I was running out of things to put in there, really added needed storage to our small space without being so bulky.

"Great shelf but lacking extras pieces in case. The shelf looks great. I am not experienced in putting things together and am of small frame. I was able to do the all on my own except I need my child to help me to lift it off the floor. That’s a good sign to me; not cheap materials. My only problems with the first shelf (I purchased and put together two) was that it is held together by wooden dowels between the shelves and I broke one. They had zero extras. There were extras for everything else but no extra dowels. The chances of a dowel breaking is pretty high. Why would they not include any extras. I used an extra dowel that was half the size from the drawer inserts I bought. Now here’s the kicker.... when I put the second one I purchased together there was ONE extra dowel! Wow. If I had only opened that particular shelf to assemble first it would have worked perfectly. They are really nice shelves. They look great";Great shelf - Positive, looks good - Positive, sturdy - Positive, ease of assembly - Positive, lacking in extra dowels - Negative, broke dowel - Neuterm in one occasion, unexpected extra dowel - Neutral.
Looks great! Liked the drawers better than cubby. The drawer inserts were easier to put together and looked completely professional when finished. The cubby with pull out door inserts were a little trickier because you had to get the screws just right so the door would open easily and stay closed when shut. I feel like the design could have been better. I thought I would just be installing a door on hinges. It is a box insert. I guess so your stuff doesn’t fall behind the shelf. Just wasn’t as easy as the drawers.;Drawers - Positive, looked professional - Positive, easier assembly - Positive, cubby with door inserts - Neutral, design could have been better - Neutral.

EKET Cabinet. I have purchased two of these cabinets and am looking to purchase another one. They are both stylish and functional. Putting it together was a bit of a challenge due to the fact that the instructions were not done in the clearest way possible but once you put it together, it is a great piece of furniture. Since it is such a uniquely shaped piece, be aware that most storage boxes sold for other units won't work well here. I suggest purchasing the EKET box which is made to fit perfectly in this unit and look very nice.;Stylish - Positive, functional - Positive, clear instructions - Negative, great piece of furniture - Positive, uniquely shaped - Neutral, purchase EKET box - Positive.

Great shelf unit. I bought the grey and wood effect unit since the other colors look rather generic. I added six captiva legs to the bottom to raise it off the floor, horizontally, and it looks better and more high end, plus I can dust under it. Other big box stores carry units that are similiar, but I have found the Kallax unit to be better quality, thicker materials. However, the inserts that go into the unit are now very low quality, so stick with using baskets and don't waste your money on the door unit inserts or drawers inserts. Too bad ikea lowered the quality on those, what a shame. Also this shelf unit is great for records!;Grey and wood effect - Positive, raised off floor - Positive, high end look - Positive, better quality materials - Positive, disappointed with inserts - Negative, good for records - Positive.

Impossible to put together. This was an impulse buy, largely because of the spectacular light orange color on the showroom floor. However, it is impossible to get the backing board on before you add the top. We spent an unbelievable 90 minutes working on this and ended up just leaving the backing off. Too bad because it's such a cute piece and now it has these weird track marks where the backing should insert. It does brighten the kitchen up beautifully.;Impossible to put together - Negative, spectacular light orange color - Positive, spent 90 minutes assembling - Negative, nice piece for kitchen decor - Positive, has weird track marks - Neutral.

Great kitchen storage. Our kitchen does not boast a lot of storage space so we bought this to house our “countertop” appliances, like the Instapot, crockpot, and toaster.

Breaks easily, extremely difficult to assemble. I watched a video showing how to assemble this..I started with the piece labeled as 1as shown in the instructions. I did everything right..but the keyholes drilled into the wood have been drilled completely wrong and nothing fits right. The plastic pieces break right off.

Easy peezy and sturdy. Been putting off this purchase and it couldn’t have gone any better between ordering and delivery! I am 64 female and was too excited to wait for help and put it together by myself in an hour. Hubby helped me lift it when he got home and I secured it easily to the wall.

Kallax is a great system if you can find it in stock. The Kallax shelving system is perfect. Easy to assemble, well made, sturdy, and looks great.

Superb turntable stand. It's easy to miss in the photos but this is an ideal turntable stand. It's at an optimum height and the lower compartment is perfectly sized for LPs including those in slipcovers. With the other matching pieces it makes an excellent media system.  Note that you should use a right angle to insure proper alignment during assembly. There is enough play in all the holes that the unit can be assembled crooked and the doors will be out of alignment. Just wait until you have a second person and a builder's square to align it and do a final tightening of all the bolts (and there are quite a few!). Personally I like that the wood panels don't come pre-drilled for the wood screws. That allows you to pick whichever you think is the best side to face upward. These are real pine so knots are common. If you want more character put them on top. If you want a cleaner tech look then you can hide them.  This unit can be assembled without the doors if desired although you will probably want to use the screws to fill the holes. Since they're black you really don't notice them. We started with the doors off then added them to change up the look.;Optimum height - Positive, ideally sized lower compartment - Positive, real pine - Positive, easy to assemble with second person - Positive, customizable with wood screws - Positive.

Perfect. My husband bought two to house his stereo equipment. They are simple and functional.;Simple and functional - Positive, used for stereo equipment storage - neutral.
Great for audio. I purchased 2 of these and the matching cabinet with doors for a vintage audio rack. It works extremely well for that and all the shelves have enough separation for LPs.  Note that this unit does not align with the other two designs because it lacks a wood top for the lower shelves making them about 1/2in low.  These are made in China with the usual quality control problems. One of my units came with mud inside the plastic bag and a corner than hadn't been painted and was already rusting. Living more than an hour from Ikea... Also note that you should use a right angle to insure proper alignment during assembly. There is enough play in all the holes that the unit can be assembled crooked.

Exactly what I needed. Needed sturdy affordable shelving to store board games. Kallax shelf was a perfect storage solution. It actually fit perfectly in a wide closet. The black-brown is more black than brown, but it still looks good. Assembly took a little while but that's to be expected with all the pieces. The finished shelf is a little wobbly, so you will probably want to use the included wall anchor to keep it sturdy.;Perfect storage solution - Positive, affordable - Positive, sturdy - Positive, easy assembly - Neutral, wobbly - Negative, wall anchor - Neutral.

Getting the doors centered is a little tricky. I absolutely love these but it did take us a little bit of effort to get the doors centered so there was an equal distance between all edges of the door and the frame of the unit. This centering is NOT covered in the instructions but can be done by messing with the hinge adjustments. These also really need a drill to create pilot holes in the kallax unit so you can screw the whole cabinet assembly in, but this is not specified in the directions.

"Wish I could rate it higher, but. I have purchased several Kallax 2x2 over the years. Each one similar in quality and ease of assembly. However, I felt the shelf space did not function for me as it always seem to have at least half of dead space. I saw the drawer product and I thought, I could make better use of the shelf space within my 2x2. I purchased 2 units (4 drawers total) after much online review. After installing the first shelf insert, i noticed the spacing was off by 1/4"" inch - not enough to affect the functionality, but enough to bother me seeing a slanted gap. I thought maybe I installed wrong (how could I, it's IKEA instructions). I installed the second insert and same thing. I thought maybe my original shelf build was off, but I checked it with a speed square - it was was ""square"" meaning good. I checked the insert and it turned out that the shelf railings were off by a few mm enough to cause a gap after install. Would I buy again? Maybe? Would I recommend? No for now.

"Nice add-on for Kallax. This is a great little add-on for the Kallax unit. Goes together real easy with 4 shelf pins.

Eket System. For my Eket purchases, I’ve stuck to buying white, combining it with pieces from either white Kallax or Besta. It has worked out well in two rooms in my home.   In the smaller room there are tight spaces, a large, low window, some lower ceilings, and unexpected corners. The smaller scale of the taller Eket one- and two-door cabinets, some stacked, some not stacked, on two walls, has been combined with a run of low, white Kallax units on the other two walls.   Putting together that room, I found Eket offers many more options and combinations for storage and stylistics in small spaces, compared to larger or old-style furniture systems.   Related to sense of space, the scale and simplicity of Eket, especially when using the taller, doored cabinets, maxs out, rather than minimizes, how the large the small room feels.   For some of the Eket pieces I purchased for the small room, I choose to buy the shallower cabinets as it is easier to squeak them into tight spaces.  In a larger, long, narrow room, with a lower ceiling on one side, the combination of the smaller, randomly stacked Eket “boxes” at the tag end of a run of simple, shorter Besta “frames” (with and without feet), on a low wall, on the floor, is bringing out the best of that space. I’m thinking that’s due to the parallel repetition of long linear lines in both furniture and exposed wood posts, beams, and floor boards. The white cabinets and the simplicity of their lines again maxes out the sense of space within the narrow room.  So, 5 stars for Eket, I think, in bedroom and living room. Maybe 6 stars when scrambled in with other Ikea cabinet systems.; Small rooms - neutral, combines with Kallax or Besta - neutral, simple design - positive, maximizes sense of space - positive, offers many options - positive.

Poorly designed. This looks great, but is held together by wooden dowels. I’ve put together a ton of IKEA furniture and this is the most poorly constructed piece.

Just what I was looking for. I was looking for a way to store the various bits and pieces for different projects I am working on in my studio. My usual method was to have a pile somewhere, and add to that pile. Of course, the piles would spill into each other, and eventually became more knitting projects pile and sewing projects pile instead of Knitting Project for Customer A, Knitting Project for Customer B, Sewing Project for Customer C, Sewing project for Customer D. I also wanted a low credenza-like shelf to add work surfaces to the studio, as well. Other, similar products from other companies looked the same online, but were considerably smaller in dimensions. When turned on its side, the KALLAX is a nice height at 30 inches. The whole unit is very heavy, strong, and sturdy. I am very pleased with it.  As far as how well it works for my original needs: I can now see, at a glance, each project and its materials. When new pieces (fabric orders, button orders, new patterns) come in, I can just toss each item into its appropriate cubby, and it is not in danger of intermingling with other projects or getting lost somewhere special where I put it so I wouldn't misplace it. (You know how that goes.) Additionally, the top of the unit turned out to work very nicely as a place to mount my yarn swift, yardage gauge, baller, and scale, resulting in a very effective yarn winding station that remains out of my way, even while set up. The flat-packed package did require two people to move (as, I assume, will the final piece of furniture), but I was able to assemble it easily by myself. Everything turned out nicely square and solid.  I bought the black-brown finish. My studio has a black and white motif, and though this is not a true black, it is close enough to blend nicely with the rest of the room. It really looks more like a wood with a black stain (there is a wood-grain pattern to the finish). The unit is not solid wood, but a composite wood product, but the finish looks very wood-like.;Storage solution - Positive, various bits and pieces - Positive, low credenza-like shelf - Positive, strong and sturdy - Positive, heavy - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, good height - Positive, blend nicely - Positive, composite wood product - Neutral.

Hard to align well. It is easy to install but hard to align well if you drilled the hole on the shelf a little off, you are unable to make the door look perfect unless re-drill the hole.

Not as straightforward to assemble as in the photos.. I have been used to intuitive and error-free procedures for IKEA furniture and this at first look seems easy and straightforward. Only it is not because if you kind of mix the order of putting the sides together which is easy to do as they all seem the same then the pieces don't fit and you have to force them apart and start over. Not a particularly fun thing to do with connections relying on a rather flimsy piece of particleboard.;Not straightforward to assemble - Negative, appears easy - Neutral, mixture of sides - Negative, flimsy connection - Negative.

Pleasantly surprised. I was skeptical about purchasing these drawers. I could not find the inside dimensions of the drawer to ensure that my items would fit. I was pleasantly surprised at how much you can store in one of these drawers. The inside dimension of the drawer is 10 ¾” wide and 12” in length. The side of the drawer is only 2 ¾” high, but the overall height of the drawer is 5 3/8”. One drawer holds all my Crystal Nuvo drops (60 plus bottles) and some sprays. I can also get 14 plastic 4x6 cases in one drawer (arranged in a specific order). I have not attached sides of the drawers to the Kallax, so they do move a little when you open the drawer.;Pleasantly surprised - Positive, Inside dimensions - neutral, holds Crystal Nuvo drops - Positive, holds 14 plastic cases - Positive, height of drawer - neutral, movable - Neutral.
Not recommended for records. I assumed from the pictures and dimensions that this would be a good fit for vinyl records, but it's such a tight fit that it's impractical. Vinyl sleeves ostensibly do fit, but any records that are slightly too tall have to be squeezed in, and the records are hard to get out. The cubes are also tedious to assemble because you have to slide the dowels into place. Fortunately, returning them in person was a painless process. Despite all that, I'd still recommend this product, so long as you use them for books or something other than records. And as always with IKEA, it's a good value.;Not recommended for records - negative, snug fit - negative, tedious assembly - negative, good value - positive.
Love it. Really keeps my stuff organized. I bought one 10 years ago and I just bought my second one 3 weeks ago.

"Don't Expect this to be like the original Expedit Doors. I loved the Expedit doors that you could slide in and out and re-position (you decide that your shelves should be in another room? You want to flip it on its' side? Easy! Just pull the doors out and flip them 90*!)  Now, the doors look nice from the outside but are so poorly made that the only way for them to have any structural integrity is to drill them into the sides of the shelf as outlined in the new instructions. No longer removable/repositionable without destroying your Kallax shelf from drilling multiple holes and if you ever decide you want to remove the doors to just have an open bookshelf, you'll be stuck with a ton of unsightly drill holes on the inside.   I bought four expecting them to be like the original ""slide in, slide out"" doors and after I opened the first one I realized how different they are now.

"Look ok / Quality lacking. I bought 4 of these to install in a bright green Kallax. The first three installed fairly easy. The fourth one gave me a lot of difficulty; one of the hinge side screws somehow broke a large hole in the side of the Kallax resulting in it being useless.  Overall I am happy with the look of this product. However, I wish that it was offered in right/left options. My unit is in a very tight corner and I’d prefer the doors to open out from the center rather than up against the wall. I also wish that the interior of the insert was black to match the door rather than bright white. If you’re using it in a white Kallax it would work. But in any other color Kallax, the white really stands out. If it were black like the door itself it would just look like part of the door.";Easy installation (for three out of four units) - Neutral, Quality issue (broken screw) - Negative, Look ok - Neutral, Right/left options - Positive, Interior color - Negative, White interior - Negative.

Impossible to put together. DO NOT BUY. Wish I actually read the reviews before driving 2.5 hours to an Ikea and purchasing 4. These are impossible to put together.

I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. Online it said they were in stock. Even at the store it said they were in stock, but they weren't. Since I do not live close to the store, I did not want to waste my trip and so I settled for buying the Kallax bookcases instead. I bought 4 of them, all different sizes. I was very disappointed.   Regardless of size they are held together with 8 screws and wooden dowls. The wooden dowls do not fit well into the holes. Since they are a few inches long but thin, a few of them broke. Luckily I have tools and my own dowl jig so I drilled them out, widened the holes and used bigger dowls.  I also had to use a rubber mallet to tap the dowls fully into the holes. I then had to also use the mallet to tap everything together because I could not push everything together snuggly and I'm pretty big.   I eventually got everything together but it was a lot more work than it needed to be. They can either use thicker dowls and/or drill their holes ever so slightly bigger so everything will fit together easily.

Good but…. There’s a lot of space wasted at the back of the drawers, as they don’t reach all the way to the back of the cube when closed. It’s weird considering how well IKEA uses every available inch. I wish the drawer sides were higher too, they are quite short.

Difficult assembly.. I've put IKEA furniture together for years. This piece, as others have commented, is a pain to put together. I followed instructions exactly.

Perfect size for storing vinyls. I bought this specifically for the purpose of storing our records since our collection had outgrown the little shelf we were using. The shelfs are perfectly sized for this. I'd had my eye on another, similar shelf from a different home goods store, but it was much more expensive so I was excited to get a better deal.  That being said, I've bought plenty of IKEA pieces in the past and know that sturdiness is not a strong suit and instructions are somewhat lacking in specificity. With that in mind, I tried to be as gentle as possible when putting the shelf together. However, after some confusion with the instructions where I had to separate pieces I'd put together, I ended up with a couple of small cracks and bumps. Luckily it was tucked in the back and I was able to remedy with duct tape and white paint so you can't really tell. Overall, I'm happy with it but know I'll probably end up replacing it with a sturdier piece sometime down the road.;Perfect size for vinyls - Positive, stored records collection - Positive, instructions lacking - Neutral, sturdiness an issue - Negative, remedied with duct tape and paint - Neutral, likely to replace - Neutral.

I spent years eyeing the. I spent years eyeing the Kallax and now finally have it. I am more than pleased to finally have it. Assembly was easy and can be done alone until it needs to be stood up. I would buy this product again and plan on adding more Kallax pieces of different sizes in the future.   I docked one star because the product arrived with damage that obviously occurred before or during packaging. The damage is on visible pieces and IKEA expects you to personally return the item to the store or accept a discount and settle for a damaged shelf (because return services are not currently available). Based on other reviews, damaged parts seems to be common.

Use a Rubber Mallet!. The directions of the large Kallax are very simple, but be sure you use a rubber mallet to hammer the shelves to the pegs when attaching the sides.

Looks great, not hard to assemble. I almost didn't buy the EKET cabinet since so many people complained about the assembly, but I figured I'm usually pretty good at assembly, and this time proved no different. The first one took about a half hour, including the underframe, the rest about 20 minutes each. A few tips - 1. Look closely at each piece illustrated in the directions to make sure it's facing the right direction before you try to interlock the pegs and holes. Sounds obvious, but it can be deceptive. 2. A rubber mallet (or hammer with a piece of leather or thick blanket over your strike area) makes locking the pegs into the holes much easier. I can see how people expecting a truly tool-less process would find this part difficult. 3. Use common sense with the black pegs that secure the backing, push the pin in only as far as it will go, they don't all have to be equally tight. 4. If attaching the underframe, an electric drill does make it easier. Once it's done, it looks great, sleek and slim but not flimsy.;Looks great - Positive, not hard to assemble - Positive, first one took 30 minutes - neutral, a few tips for assembly - neutral, looks sleek and slim - Positive.

Stylish, Versatile, Affordable. The Kallax (and previously the Expedit) series is possibly the best product that Ikea has ever produced. I can't think of a more versatile piece of furniture.   Need some book cases? 4x5 Kallax. Liquor cabinet? 4x1 Kallax with a few hacks. Custom desk setup? 2x4 Kallax with some modifications.  I say this with first-hand experience, because I personally own a dozen (seriously, literally 12) individual Kallax units of varying sizes and am using them as a linen drawer, art supply case, book case, extra dining-room storage, a modified desk, and a room divider, and more. My apartment is probably 50% Kallax by volume. These things are awesome!  Their modern yet simplistic style, and the sheer efficiency of perfectly square cubby holes, make this the swiss army knife of affordable furniture.;Versatile furniture - Positive, modern style - Positive, simplistic design - Positive, affordable - Positive, perfectly square cubbyholes - Positive.

Great shelf unit!. I love these shelves! I bought 2 to cover a wall in our toy room, and the cubbies are perfect for storing lots of different things - a bin of small toys in one, stuffed animals in another, books in another, etc. I took off one star because the wood pegs provided for assembly are just a bit too long, making it impossible to get a tight fit. I thought it was just a fluke or they weren't going in all the way, but every peg was the same size and no amount of banging or applying pressure (i.e. my husband leaning almost his entire 200 lbs of weight on it) made them fit better. So there is a little gap between the main sides and the inner shelves, but luckily it is not really noticeable when there is stuff on the shelves.;Perfect for toy storage - Positive, love these shelves - Positive, bought 2 - Neutral, cubbies for different things - Positive, assembly wood pegs too long - Negative, slightly loose fit - Neutral.

Simple, effective. It’s amazing what $100 and some vision can do to change a room.

I love the whole Kallax system.. I have being buying Kallax for years. I keep adding doors and drawers over time to keep clutter out of sight but leave some spaces open for things that I want to display.

Terrible construction. Love the idea of EKET, but the pegs and holes are so poorly made nothing actually fits together very well.

Earthy and Elegant. I bought three of these for my new wellness/fitness studio. They line up next to each other perfectly (because of the adjustable feet).

Never too many bookshelves!. We bought this nearly a month ago for use in my eldest daughter’s bedroom. She had shorter desks she had outgrown, and with the need for her to have time to intensely focus for a couple of her school subjects, hooking a desktop to these shelves and have all of her books and binders available to slide right out onto her desk has been perfect! (We homeschool, so we have a LOT of books!)  We have two of this same shelving units in black/brown and two larger, and 4x4 and 5x5 in the black/brown.

I know some comments on the upper piece with the doors said that they couldn't get them to align properly. Mine align perfectly. I had to play with it a little bit, but they are perfectly aligned and fully functional. This set looks so clean and sleek and it's so easy to use for the kiddos. Perfect addition to my home.

"Great unit!. We bought two of these for a closet/small den area. We put one horizontal like a low dresser, and another vertically, like a bookcase. It's pretty great because they match so well. I like the grey with wood color; it looks sleek and modern but still warm. We put the seaweed baskets in them which fit well (though be careful because sometimes the baskets can be pokey, and make clothes smell like straw), and one the horizontal one, added the kallax grey doors. I wish the doors came with golden knobs because the silver knobs on them don't match the warm tone of the wood as well. Overall, seem sturdy, fantastic price, not too hard to assemble, and really add a ton of store (equivalent to a full sized dresser) to a space. We're excited that if we move again someday we could repurpose them easily as a tv stand, or bookshelf in virtually any room of the house. We might even get another for our bedroom!

Looks great. Gonna start of by saying use a power screwdriver! Since this is an add on there are no pre-drilled holes. It takes a good amount of arm strength to use a regular screwdriver.

Great Look .. POOR Quality. I purchased the EKET because of the smaller footprint/sleeker design compared to the KALLAX. Unfortunately, the unit we purchased did not align properly and cracked during assembly. We exchanged the unit assuming this was just a lemon but had another issue when assembling our second EKET.

Adds a nice look. Gonna start of by saying use a power screwdriver! Since this is an add on there are no pre-drilled holes. It takes a good amount of arm strength to use a regular screwdriver.
