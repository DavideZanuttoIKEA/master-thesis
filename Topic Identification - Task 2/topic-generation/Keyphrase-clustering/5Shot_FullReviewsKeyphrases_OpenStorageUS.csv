White Kallax Shelves. These shelves are perfect! I bought the 9 cubbie and the 4 cubbie and put them side by side in my closet. They look so nice and professional. They provide so much extra storage. I will probably buy more for the upstairs closet as well. I hired the Task Rabbit to put them together and that was a great experience. Thank you IKEA for such a nice product.;Perfect shelves - Positive, nice and professional look - Positive, provide extra storage - Positive, great experience - Positive.

Finally no MDF!. Finally no MDF!;No MDF - Positive.
Patience with the assembly pays off.. I ordered two of these for my living space. The units are solid and seem durable. However, patience is key in getting these assembled in a way that the vertical supports don't torque themselves into alignments that aren't squared up in the corners. Get all four vertical pieces barely attached, and then go around tightening each corner a few turns at a time under all are fully tightened. It'll take longer this way but you'll be happier with the end result. If you tighten them one by one you'll find that the vertical supports won't square up well, and you'll end up having to undo them all to correct the problem. Slow and steady wins this race.;Solid units - Positive, durable - Positive, requires patience - Neutral, square corners - Positive.

Minimal & pleasing storage solution. Love this shelf! It allows a lot more light into a dark room, has ample storage, & is very sturdy. It has a clean, classic look that is very minimalist.   It does require two people to build, but with lockdown I had to build it alone. So I used thick books as risers to stabilize the pieces as I was building and it was a huge success — with no bowing or any issues.  Could not be happier with this shelf. If only the smaller version was not discontinued! Wish I had more space so more space so I could get another one.;Minimal look - Positive, Ample storage - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, allws more light - Positive, satisfied customer - Positive, wish for more space - Neutral.
Cost Cutting Garbage, ignore Older Reviews. I bought one of these guys in 2015 and it went together like a breeze - its still standing after being moved across the state several times. This one I got in 2024 - EVERY shelf piece is hollow with their cardboard honeycomb stuff inside (formerly plywood) and MUCH thinner wall structure on each piece. The shelves flexed so badly it doesn't slot together and leaves huge gaps, plus we knocked a hole into the side panel of it with a soft rubber mallet trying to get it lined up. And yet, Ikea has the gall to charge more for it? Spare me, please.;Hollow pieces - Negative, cardboard honeycomb stuff - Negative, thinner wall structure - Negative, flexed shelves - Negative, huge gaps - Negative, expensive - Negative.

"It fits perfectly under my windows when placed horizontally. I needed a low bookcase to place under my living room windows to organize books, handwork, and various ""stuff"" in our small apartment to eliminate clutter.  Placed horizontally with no additional frame or legs it fits perfectly.  I have room to display houseplants on the top.   I have four Knipsa storage baskets placed on the bottom four cubby holes which work great and look very nice.    Our furniture is  mostly in traditional wood tones but the white looks clean and bright under the windows which have white plantation shutters and woodwork.  All in all I find this purchase a good value for our purposes, and it was easy to assemble.

"some amateur design, but cheaper than most. Not IKEA's finest assembly procedure or fit+finish, but well priced for the appearance of the final product.  * Super-annoying adhesive on stickers on the frame has to be scrubbed off. No clean peel... * Mis-drilled side piece meant either skipping one set of screws or skipping the stiffening plates (I did the former) * No wall attach kit despite recommendation to attach to wall. Note you'll need less common 2"" screws if you're using anchors. * Poor fit: gaps between shelves and frame. * Wooden shelves don't have pre-drilled holes and the laminate is too tough for the tiny wood screws. You're going to ALSO need a drill to pre-drill (not in instructions).  Looks nice enough when done but twice as annoying as expected. Feels like some designer's first project and he doesn't have his own place so never assembles furniture.  I wouldn't buy another. ";Amateur design - Neutral, cheaper than most - Positive, annoying adhesive -Negative, mis-drilled side piece -Negative, no wall attach kit - Negative, poor fit - Negative, wooden shelves with tough laminate - Negative.
Worst Ikea product ever. I understand that it is chip so I anticipated some issues with qualities. But assembling the product is a nightmare because it requires some tricks to attach the last wall to complete the shelf. I gave up and carefully used a resin-head hummer to finish the ugly gaps. At the end I smashed it leaving some cracks on the outside. Goes to garbage.;Nightmare to assemble - Negative, required tricks - Negative, cracks on outside - Negative, low quality - Negative, went to garbage - Negative.

Instructions clearly not written to go together- look at BOTH!!. Love the unit, but I’m extremely irritated that the instructions for the shelving unit say nothing about the underframe requiring four of the larger bolts from the unit to come out so the brackets can be installed. That information is in the instructions for the underframe. I have problems with dexterity and am none too happy about doing the work of getting those bolts in securely just to turn around and have to do it again. Also would have appreciated one of the screwdrivers with 90 degree bends for getting the underframe screws in. Otherwise, lovely storage unit. Tip over hardware is a lot better than the old plastic kits and the wide variety of inserts add more functionality.;Instructions incorrect - Negative, Love the unit - Positive, tip over hardware better - Positive, wide variety of inserts - Positive.
Cute & Functional. I love my shelf so much. My uncle painted the frame part pink to match my kitchen decor. I use it to free up space on my countertops. I put my little white retro style microwave on it, my pink toaster and pink bubblegum machine filled with chocolates. I also put 2 pans (pink of course) on the bottom shelf.

Easy to put together but flimsy. I ended up returning because I purchased the tall version and needed the short.

Love it!. I made this desk in 45 min. It was extremely easy to build with the instructions. Just make sure you don’t miss a step! And I was able to do it all by myself.

So we didn’t have boxes for days!;Extremely easy to build - Positive, quick assembly - Positive, clear instructions - Positive, able to assemble alone - Positive, efficient packaging - Positive.
Poorly-aligned holes in uprights made for a miserable assembly experience.. You'd think that drilling holes down the center of a strip of wood would be relatively easy for a manufacturer to do well -- but this shelving unit shows that IKEA is not up to the task. The holes in the uprights were sometimes centered and sometimes not, and in one case this required a bit of home woodworking (using far more in the way of tools than came in the boxes) to correct. If the price were half of what it is, I might not gripe too much -- but for this price, it's completely inexcusable for IKEA's factory to be so incredibly sloppy. It's also important to note that these shelves look to be solid slabs in the product photos, but are actually made of thin sheets of metal wrapped into square tubes at the front and back -- this means that they sag when weight is put anywhere other than the ends, front, or back of the shelves.;Miserable assembly experience - Negative, poorly-aligned holes - Negative, home woodworking required - Neutrical, sloppy factory - Negative, thin sheets of metal - Neutral.
Easy assembly and looks great!. Easy assembly and looks great!;Easy assembly - Positive, Looks great - Positive.
Love it - sturdy. I love the Kallax because it is so simple and incredibly sturdy.;Sturdy Kallax - Positive.
Love this!. I love the quality of this. It was relatively easy to assemble and it’s solid. Great value and definitely recommend. The only thing that I might like to see would be an option for a back to enclose the compartments to use as a cubby system instead of shelves. I like these better than other bookshelves because they don’t wobble when put together.;Love the quality - Positive, relatively easy to assemble - Positive, solid - Positive, great value - Positive.
Kallax. I've had all sizes of the Kallax storage units.  I've combined them, in all sizes, like a puzzle to fill a whole wall.  Be sure to tether if you do that.  They fit most decorative styles.  ;Fits most decorative styles - Positive, Combined like a puzzle - Neutral, Available in all sizes - Positive.
Beautiful. This might be my favorite piece in my office. I’ve used the bottom cubes for storage bins, the top cubes for display cases, and the top shelf for books and plants.

Baggebo. Looks amazing in my bedroom .;Looks amazing - Positive
A Staple!. I got 2 of these shelves and adore them. They're stable, sturdy, and easy to put together by yourself. I would also imagine they're easy to paint over for a different look. I would buy another!  One tip for assembly is to just lightly hand screw everything in before tightening them all the way in the final step! Otherwise, sometimes the holes don't align properly :);Stable - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive, Easy to paint - Neutral, Sturdy shelves - Positive.
Cute but not easy!. These cubes are very cute and practical but the fact that Ikea sells them as easy to assemble baffles the mind. I have done several of these at this point and there hasn't been a single one that hasn't required some light hammering (which risks ruining the board) or basically me just accepting that one of the sides will be slightly off-kilter. Every single product I have bought from Ikea that required actual tools to assemble (including a kitchen cabinet!) has been easier to assemble in comparison/proportionately speaking. Like I said, they are cute though, and a practical solution for some awkward storage needs around the house, so it's a good bang for the buck as long as you take the video on the website with a grain of salt.;Cute design - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative.
Record storage. Works great for what we bought it for;Record storage - Neutral, works great - Positive.
Nifty accessory. This works beautifully in the Kallax. It is a lot more sturdy and natural looking when it’s installed in the unit.

an organizational workhorse. the Kallax holds books, papers, artifacts...the list is too long to mention.

Baggebo shelf. My teen loves this shelf! We have had Kallax for storage in his room a long time, but he has been asking for shelving to display smaller items.

This was a perfect solution at a price we could afford.;Teen loves shelf - Positive, affordable - Positive, displayed smaller items - Neutral.

Perfect for vinyl record storage. Must mount it though. This is perfect for my album collection. I used metal wall anchors from the hardware store to mount all four corners to the wall. I have about 900 vinyl albums and this holds them perfectly. As always follow the directions. Assembling on a carpet using a level are important. I also added wood glue to all the dowels so they stay solid. ;Vinyl record storage - Positive, Must mount - Neutral, holds albums perfectly - Positive, followed directions - Neutral, used metal wall anchors - Neutral, added wood glue - Positive.

Doesn’t fit the kallax shelf. I purchased it thinking it would fit in the shelf like the reviews and description said but it don’t. It too big for the shelf space and annoying trying to fit. Easy to put together but useless because I can’t fit it in the shelf just sitting in my home collecting dust;Doesn't fit in Kallax shelf - Negative, easy to assemble - Neutral, collecting dust - Negative.
Huge Disappointment!!! Doesn't fit- too large!!. Very disappointed with these - they don't fit.  I picked these up with some other items in Renton yesterday - a 110 mile drive from me. Got home with them and they don't fit - they are too large to insert into the cubicle.  I have 2 different Kallax units - one is a 20 cubicle unit, the other an 8 cubicle unit - these will not fit into any cubicle in either of the units!!!  According to the sticker on these inserts they were manufactured (?) in Poland 2021-11-08. I saw another reviewer say that theirs were too big too. What happened to quality control??? I don't make a drive that far on a regular basis so, I'm stuck with the useless things since I won't pay shipping to return them.  Shouldn't have happened - very disappointed.;Huge disappointment - Negative, not fitting - Negative, too large - Negative, poor quality control - Neutative, from Poland - Neutral.
Great Product, But Disappointed. This shelving unit is absolutely beautiful and did not seem difficult to assemble - I hired a worker from Task Rabbit so I don't know for sure. However, I was so disappointed to find out that this particular item is just two units, one double width and a single width, put very close together. It is not one big unit. With so many combinations you can make from these units, I have no idea why this is the only one that is sold together, it's very misleading. I also had mine delivered so didn't realize until I had them in my home. I decided to return the single width unit and buy another double width one.;Beautiful design - Positive, misleading description - Negative.
elegant and sturdy storage solution. I already had three of the single shelves, and when I bought my house I added these additional pieces to make a full wall for books. It almost looks built in, and it's a gorgeous focal point for my books and records.;Elegant - Positive, sturdy - Positive, storage solution - Positive, gorgeous focal point - Positive.
Love the low profile. I wouldn't have thought from the description that these metal shelves would have such a low profile, but after seeing them at a friends house I was sold.  They are solid and the glass definitely makes them easy on the eye. Would buy again!;Low profile - Positive, solid - Positive, glass shelves - Positive, easy on the eye - Positive, would buy again - Positive.

Wonderful storage. This is a wonderful piece of furniture for any sewing studio or craft room.   I use my Kallax units for storing fabrics wrapped around comic book boards.

Perfection. I waited MONTHS for Vittsjo to come back in stock, and I am so glad I didn't give up and purchase something elsewhere. To get a similar look elsewhere will cost ~$300. This shelf unit is GORGEOUS – modern, clean lines, simple, well-constructed, sturdy. I do wish the holes in the top and bottom wood slabs were pre-drilled, but it wasn't too difficult to do it ourselves. We also didn't receive enough padding stickers for the glass, so we improvised. I can't say enough good things about this unit otherwise.;Gorgeous design - Positive, modern and clean lines - Positive, well-constructed - Positive, sturdy - Positive, waited months for availability - Neutral, simple - Positive.
Awesome shelves. We use these for plants, books, games and display items. They’re so versatile and surprisingly sturdy. Love how the light can flow down through the shelves;Versatile - Positive, sturdy - Positive, for plants, books, games - Neutral, display items - Neutral, surprisingly sturdy - Positive, allow light flow - Positive.
Great but.... The shelf is great. Bought it to use for bathroom storage and it fits perfectly. I took off one star because it was way to hard to assemble. Would have been great if Ikea had made the screws for adult sized hands!;Great shelf - Positive, fits perfectly - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative, adult-sized screws - Neutral.
great shelving units. I saw these in a photo and they looked like what I wanted. I ordered and could not be happier with them. They are sturdy, well built, look great and most of all very easy to assemble.;Sturdy - Positive, well-built - Positive, look great - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive.
Glossy and great. The glossy white Kallax is one of those IKEA pieces that is such a great price point for how modern it feels. The 4 square version was easy to put together solo. And I paired it next to a larger one I bought years ago. This is a great extension that was in budget and looks seamless. Highly rec. and go glossy — it’s the best of all the colors;Glossy white - Positive, modern - Positive, great price point - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, seamless extension - Positive.
Easy to assemble. And hold. Easy to assemble. And hold more than I expected. Turned an 11 year old shelf into something new with the drawers.  Please note - you do have to screw in the insert, so they are permanent.;Easy to assemble - Positive, hold well - Positive, more than expected - Positive, permanent drawers - Neutral.
Love it!. Clean lines, great configuration for my purposes;Love it - Positive, clean lines - Positive, great configuration - Positive.
The Best for my Craft Room. I put this off for years but finally with an update of flooring was forced to organize my craft room.  I chose the Kallex to be the main form of storage and love the pieces I bought!  the 16 unit wall shelving piece plus the pieces to divide several of the areas for paper, and other supplies are perfect.  It was much quicker to install than I expected and now only after a couple of days, I realize how silly my procrastination actually was.  I should have done this years ago!!!  ;Main form of storage - Positive, love the pieces - Positive, quick installation - Positive, perfect for craft room - Positive.
Worked perfectly for the storage. Worked perfectly for the storage closet;Worked perfectly - Positive, storage closet - Neutral.
The best options. I was looking for something nice and elegant for my spa 🧖🏼‍♀️ and it really is how I wanted it;Nice - Positive, elegant - Positive, for spa - Neutral.
NOT difficult to assemble!. Lots of reviews saying these are difficult to assemble. They are not. You just have to follow the instruction of leaving the panel labelled “1” on the bottom throughout the entire assembly. The groove in panel one is significantly deeper than the grooves in the other panels. This allows the piece that slides in the back to sit lower so that you’re able to pop in the last panel without any resistance. Again, just leave the panel labeled “1” on the floor (or table if you’re assembling on a table surface) and you should be fine.  **I did struggle until I realized my mistake. Once I figured out that I wasn’t following the instructions properly, these cubes assembled in about a minute and a half. ;Easy to assemble - Positive, clear instructions - Positive.
Mr bub . My husband loves this little cart;Little cart - Neutral, husband loves - Positive.
Don’t give up like I almost did!!!. Writing this review to help people who had trouble like me. I spent over an hour trying to align the pieces to fit, I even searched for tutorials on YouTube, and couldn’t find one for this specific model. Was very frustrated and was about to send all 4 of my Eket back to where they come from.   I took them apart and I realized the fault is not the product, it’s in the instructions. All the side boards should be numbered from 1-4, not just the first board. Essentially you would connect number one first with the sides and the pieces inside, and at the VERY END, the last piece should be the board opposite from number 1. If your last piece is the ones on the side of number 1, you will never get it to align. It took me less than 5 minutes to finish each one doing it this way, which is to follow the pictures to a tee. But Ikea should modify the instructions to be more specific and fool proof and number each side boards.   It looks beautiful and perfectly aligned when done!;Alignment difficult - Negative, faulty instructions - Negative, beautifully aligned - Positive.
"Good size for my needs. Easy to assemble!!!. I bought two white Ekets 2 x 2 as the size was good for my needs. When I was reading the reviews, I was in a doubt if I can assemble it myself properly. Luckily, I found on Youtube a video instruction, how to do it ""ikea eket instruction part 2"". I even didn't use the paper instruction. Both pieces were assembled perfectly!!! Thank you Ikea and the person who did these video instructions.";Good size - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive, video instruction - Neutral.

The additional stand was a great addition to give it a nice touch.;Perfect fit - Positive, tv stand - Positive, additional storage - Positive, nice touch - Neutral.
Great product. These drawers are much nicer than expected.  They went together relatively easy and having the metal bearing slides make them very smooth in operation.  I even bought another set.;Great product - Positive, smooth in operation - Positive, went together easy - Positive, metal bearing slides - Positive.
Missing the frame….. I bought this shelf 2 weeks ago. I tried to set it up today and figured out the frame part was missing. Is this shelf including 2 parts? So upset about it. ☹️;Missing frame - Negative, shelf - Neutral.
"Putting together was a pain. Its so difficult to put together for something that's just supposed to ""snap together"". the plastic attachment grooves on the sides don't work nor fit together perfectly so a part of the sides don't lay flat with each other. Had to literally use a rubber mallet to force things to fit better. And even then they didn't line up correctly. Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is bc the assembly was the only problem I've had with it everything else was fine I guess..

My new favorite IKEA furniture. This thing is great!  It's super easy to put together, and thanks to the various inserts it's also a very versatile piece of shelving.  I added the pedestal on the bottom so that I could place it over an air conditioning vent.;Favorite IKEA furniture - Positive, super easy assembly - Positive, versatile shelving - Positive, added pedestal - Neutral.
It serves a purpose. It serves a purpose for storage, but i think the materials are too cheap. When we were putting together our KALLAX cubes, it didn’t line up perfectly despite our careful attention to building instructions. Now the shelves don’t shut correctly and it bothers me for the price and time spent trying to build it. There’s just something not right about the way the material looks and feels. It looked better online than in person. Not satisfied sadly ;Serves a purpose - Positive, cheap materials - Negative, doesn't line up perfectly - Negative, not satisfied - Negative.
Perfect size. Purchased to clean up a corner that I wa using for storage. Looks and works great;Perfect size - Positive, looks great - Positive, works great - Positive.

Installed in closet. These are really nice and durable in closet;Nice - Positive, Durable - Positive, in closet - Neutral.
"Terrible quality. I have an older Kallax shelf with several drawer units. The drawer enclosures are made from actual wood. These pieces of garbage barely qualify as cardboard. They are flimsy and arrived RIPPED. And i now realize I am writing a review using the word ""ripped"" when describing a drawer enclosure.";Terrible quality - Negative, flimsy drawer units - Negative, arrived ripped - Negative.
Hacked the Use. Instead of purchasing a closet system, I used two of the Kallax units to rework a walk in closet. Standing, this particular configuration fits under the existing hanging clothes rack. I place a second Kallax on the other wall in a horizontal position. I can now hang cloths, neatly arrange folded sweaters and jeans, and have more room than ever before.;Fits under clothing rack - Positive, second Kallax in horizontal position - Positive, neatly arranged folders - Positive, more room than ever before - Positive.
Cheaply made, Flimsy. These used to be made much better. They are terrible now. I wrote another review under the inserts with the doors that goes into more detail, but essentially, these used to be decent, but now they are little more than cardboard, with a laminated particleboard front. Very disappointing.;Flimsy - Negative, cheaply made - Negative.
So disappointing!. We bought this newer version of the Kallax, after having owned the older version (c. 90s-2000s.) This was very, very disappointing. Extremely cheaply made. Would never hold up to continued regular use. We were expecting the same quality we used to get from Ikea products. This is not anywhere near the quality of the Ikea products we used to purchase!;Disappointing - Negative, cheaply made - Negative, not durable - Negative, lower quality - Negative.
Units are great but all arrived damaged. Units are great but all arrived damaged and I do not have a local Ikea store to return them to. ;Units are great - Positive, arrived damaged - Negative.
Space saving, beautiful. Used this to replace a dresser in a small house, wish we saw it sooner! Able to organize and save space! Still have ample room on it for more.

Easy to put together , Even for this old person!;Space saving - Positive, beautiful - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, ample room - Positive, doors and drawers - Positive.
Impossible to assemble. These are really nice looking, but were impossible to put together. The peg holes weren't machined enough to fit the pegs properly. We returned them.;Nice looking - Neutral, impossible to assemble - Negative.

Excellent . Big space ; I cannot extract keyphrases and sentiment from such a short and ambiguous sentence.
I had the old ones that were made of solid materia.. This new design is awful unfortunately. It’s flimsy, and requires you to make holes and damage the bookcase. Wish I could return it. Disappointing;Old design - Positive, solid material - Positive, new design - Negative, flimsy - Negative, requires damage - Negative.
Frame needs to be attached to unit. So disappointed in this--you just set the shelving unit on top of the underframe, which means it just wobbles around.  There needs to be a way to attach the frame to the shelving. ;Needs frame attachment - Negative.
Unbelievably Cheap. I know IKEA is the place to buy affordable furniture. We purchased one of these for our young daughter years ago (maybe 2015 or 2016), and it has held up to her, her friends, and one across the country. We just bought another one for a closet, but this time, the quality is significantly lesser. I don't know if the shelves are made of foam, or what, but they are so light that they float/glide across each other when stacking. I'd estimate that each shelf weighs less than a ream of paper. We're desperate and we live far away from an IKEA so we'll keep it, but honestly, it is just so cheap I don't know if I'll go back for the 4 shelf Kallax that is delayed due to quality issues (according to the salesperson). This can't possibly be good for the environment.;Unbelievably cheap - Neutral (Mixed: positive for price, negative for quality), Durable (previous purchase) - Positive, Lightweight - Negative, Significantly lesser quality - Negative.
Impossible to assemble. This would have been a nifty little shelf if only one could assemble it. Holes of uneven size and not deep enough for screws or dowels to fit or be tightened properly. The pieces that I put together kept falling apart so it was impossible to build because one couldn't get the frame to stay put long enough to attach the shelves.;Impossible to assemble - Negative, nifty little shelf - Neutral, uneven holes - Negative, shallow holes - Negative.
Tight fit, but great for shoes. I knocked off a star due to how difficult it was to get them inserted into an already built Kallax unit. I would recommend inserting at time of Kallax build, before final tightening of all the bolts. That said, they are great for dividing the squares on the Kallax. I have a 4x4 square unit in my closet and installed four of these along the bottom row. It allows me to neatly store 4 pairs of shoes in each Kallax square.;Tight fit - Neutral, great for shoes - Positive, difficult to insert - Negative, dividing squares - Positive.
Hobby Supplies Storage. It’s not easy finding storage that is deep enough for my 12x 12 scrapbook paper. Kallax fits it perfectly! And the various inserts make each cube customizable for other items I need to store for my hobbies.;Deep enough - Positive, fits scrapbook paper - Positive, customizable - Positive.
Just what I was looking for!. I love my Kallax layered shelves. They fit perfectly in my shelving unit. They were so easy to put together without any tools. I use them to stack cardstock in my craft room. I couldn’t be happier.

Kallax accessories . Helped me organize my craft papers ;Organized craft papers - Positive, Kallax accessories - Neutral.
Great slots. This worked really well for the purpose I had. Plenty sturdy enough for folders, little piles of papers and such.;Great slots - Positive, sturdy enough - Positive.
Kallax. So sad not to have my Expedit as an option. These are ok but the others were far superior (I had them over a decade and 3 major moves). My recommendation is based sadly on the fact that there is no longer the previous version. The base is a good option to have however it is waaay too tall.;Previous version - Neutral (with a tinge of sadness), Good base - Positive, too tall - Negative.
Love it. I use it to hold things think they are tiny drawers. I craft so it holds my paper cutters, stamp positioner, and anything large that needs to be stored flats;Love it - Positive, used for small items - Positive, holds paper cutters - Positive.
"Paper storage. I like stacking my papers vertically, it's perfect. The unit does  take up some space on 2 sides of the cube, I use job tickets/dry erase folders for my paper projects, they are 13"" tall so don't fit in these, but 12X12 papers fit perfectly.";Stacking papers vertically - Positive, unit takes up space - Neutral, fits 12X12 papers - Positive.
Well designed, easy to install. Very versatile piece of furniture.  These drawer inserts are easy to put together and install.

Easy Assembly / Great for Vinyl or Other Shelving. Didn't take me long to put these together (I ordered two for giving myself room to expand my ever-growing vinyl collection). Very little tools needed for assembling, and it's great for why I need it. A little tricky getting everything to line up, but once you do, it just pretty much slides into place and is very sturdy.;Easy assembly - Positive, great for vinyl - Positive, sturdy - Positive, little tools required - Positive.

Elegant steel shelves. I bought a set of these 10 years ago and just bought another. You can't tell them apart, they have held up so well. For steel shelves, they are very elegant and suitable for a living room or anywhere. The wide drawers work well, but due to the width you don't want to put anything too heavy in them.;Elegant steel shelves - Positive, held up well - Positive, suitable for living room - Positive, wide drawers - Neutral.
Turns small spaces into dense storage. This is perfect for small areas between other things, what might otherwise be wasted space becomes 4 spacious cubes for clothes, toys, whatever. Also helps with de-cluttering because a cube can contain the sort of things like alarm clocks or a jewelry box that you would normally think has to take up valuable space on top of a bedside table or dresser.;Dense storage - Positive, small spaces - Positive, spacious cubes - Positive, de-clutters - Positive.
Kallax forever. Of course Kallax is the best deal on the planet for storing vinyl LPs, but it can do so much more. Having 4x4 or 5x5 cubes to work with is liberating, and enables you to put things that go together in the same cube, instead of having to find wherever something will fit (where you'll never find it).;Best deal on the planet - Positive, stores vinyl LPs - Positive, liberating - Positive.
These are great!. They are different from the ones we got several years ago….more cheaply made, but they work the same.;Great - Positive, Different - Neutral, More cheaply made - Neutral.
Great storage unit!. Great storage unit!;Great storage unit - Positive.
Love the new color. We got this for the playroom to hold the grandkid's toys and it works great. We purchased some of the Drona fabric cartons to hold more items. Very pleased with the look and the size of this product.;New color - Positive, holds grandkid's toys - Positive, works great - Positive, purchased fabric cartons - Neutral, please with look - Positive, satisfied with size - Positive.
We love these. Just what we needed for a greenhouse project! Also easily assembled- always a plus;Love these - Positive, for greenhouse - Positive, easily assembled - Positive.
Almost 5 ⭐️. Solid build. I like the unit but received one of the frame rusty. Tried some elbow grease and some solution with no luck, so I had that portion facing to the wall. I read almost all the reviews before buying, didn’t expect that I would come across with the same issue with other reviewers. Still a good unit.;Solid build - Positive, rusty frame - Negative.
Ruined my life. I’ve never experienced such frustration in my life. We had four people trying to put this together in turns for over 4 hours and still could not do it. It is the bane of my existence. The amount of agony and trauma I have gone through is unparalleled. I’ve bought previous IKEA furniture and I’ve never had this issue before. Please, for everyone’s sanity, don’t buy this. Even when finished there’s no sense of accomplishment, just more pain. We spent so long, agonized every step of the way, and for what? This piece of junk? It doesn’t even look that good. For the amount of effort it takes, it is not worth it.;Frustrating assembly - Negative, bane of existence - Negative, agony and trauma - Negative, long assembly time - Negative, not worth the effort - Negative, unattractive appearance - Negative.

Kallax Shelves. These worked out really well in our bathroom.;Kallax Shelves - Neutral, worked out well - Positive.
Love our Kallax. Great and versatile storage in my grandchildrens room. It fits perfectly on our IKEA tv console, making for the ideal solution to overflowing toy boxes. We will eventually add some drawer and door inserts.;Versatile storage - Positive, fits perfectly - Positive.
Use it as a bench for the mudroom. It fits perfectly with the DIY mudroom project. ;Perfect fit - Positive, DIY mudroom project - Neutral.
Base does not actually attach to Kallax unit. Looks great with the raised base, but Ikea should really note in the product information that the base does not attach to the Kallax unit, so you have to anchor to the wall.  It would still be nice to attach the base to the storage unit somehow.;Raised base - Positive, does not attach to unit - Negative.
Good quality, fair price. It's a good quality shelf- second time buying one.;Good quality - Positive, fair price - Positive.
Easy assembly and fit perfectly. Purchased this shelf unit to fit within a small space and after the easy assembly it fit into that space like it was made for it.    Only criticism on assembly is for alignment of the pieces.  They did okay on the overall design, but it would work even better if you simply used screws that had a bit of an alignment collar.  Similar to a lug bolt on a car is used to help align the wheel to the hub.  These completely flat based screws makes you have to leave them all a little loose until all pieces are in place and then you can tighten and align as you go.  Not too difficult but still not as simple as it could be.;Easy assembly - Positive, fits perfectly - Positive, small space - Neutral, alignment of pieces - Neutral.
Look nice but they sag under load. I have several of these under some 4x2 and 4x4 Kallax shelves. They add a nice look by raising the shelves up off the floor. However, for being made of steel, they do sag a bit causing the entire shelf to sag a bit. It’s disappointing. There should be a set of legs at the midpoint to help support things. I’m going to have to find a way to add support.;Look nice - Positive, Sag under load - Negative.
Best shelf for house plants!!. Great shelf for house plants ;Best shelf - Positive, house plants - Positive.
Great piece, a bit wobbly. I’ve waited to be close enough to make an IKEA trip for this piece. I love how modern it looks and it was relatively easy to put together. Once assembled, it seems like it could use another set of the triangle braces that are provided for the first glass shelf on the bottom. I know it would mess with the aesthetic a bit, but I’m thinking about how I could brace it on my own.  It did NOT come with any wall hardware or pieces to attach to the wall. Since it sits out a bit with a baseboard, it would take a very long screw to get to the wall. I was expecting the plastic “zip tie” type anchors to be included.;Modern look - Positive, Relatively easy to put together - Positive, wobbly - neutral, lack of wall hardware - negative.
Fine small shelf unit. Well built, easy to assemble, attractive.  The large shelf spaces are functional for books of assorted sizes.;Well built - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, attractive - Positive, functional large shelf spaces - Positive.
Love the modularity. I love the look of the shelf unit, assembly was very easy, and the idea of modules which are drawers, cabinets, or baskets is pure genius. Unfortunately it is not very stable and I suspect that it will need bracing before too long for it not to collapse.;Modularity - Positive, love look of shelf unit - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, stable - Negative.
Super wobbly??. I just bought 2 of the 5x5 units and had them assembled by TaskRabbit... and they are VERY wobbly. This is a huge surprise as we had several of the older model and they were sturdy as rocks. Not sure if they were poorly assembled this time or if this is due to the newer model? Anyone else have this issue?;Very wobbly - Negative, poorly assembled - Neutral.
No screws to bolt to wall. For a shelving unit that depends on being bolted to the wall per IKEA’s instructions, they didn’t actually provide the screws needed to do it, nor do the instructions tell you at the beginning that you need said screw before you begin. We have a two-year-old, and so we panic-searched our house for something to bolt the shelf with before we had to pick him up from daycare. All the instructions had was a dotted outline of the screw with an absent product number (which all the included parts had throughout the pictures) to show you it wasn’t included in the materials provided, and that info only showed up at the back of the instruction book in the steps for bolting it to the wall. There was no notice at the beginning saying to be sure to buy the screws so you could ensure you had all materials before building the shelf. Frustrating as a parent, to say the least!;No screws provided - negative, depend on wall bolting - negative, unclear instructions - negative.
Some disadvantages compared to Expedit. So, it should go without saying that this is an iconic shelving unit and I'm glad to have it. That said, you asked for a review and the honest answer is: I'm quite disappointed. I had a 5 x 5 Expedit shelf unit and I expected Kallax to be very similar. First, after renting a truck to move the boxes, I discovered (in store) that the 5x5 Kallax unit has been sold out for months and that it was unlikely to be back in stock soon, in any color. I ended up opting to buy a 4x4 plus a 2x4 to make the room divider I needed. This is somewhat less than optimal because the Kallax has a wider edge than internal part. Another disadvantage of the Kallax units is that they have exposed hardware on the top of the unit, and drilled holes inside the sides of the shelves that are visible if you don't use the wall mounting hardware (which I don't, because I'm using the shelves as a room divider). Both of these features make the Kallax look less polished than the Expedit. Finally, I'm very disappointed that the door units must be drilled into the Kallax. I loved the Expedit door inserts in part because I could easily take them out and transfer them to a different block to change up the look. Now the units can't be moved, and they are much trickier to assemble. All in all, after having an Expedit, Kallax seems like more of a hassle, less polished, and less flexible.;Iconic shelving unit - Positive, wider edges - Negative, exposed hardware - Negative, drilled door units - Negative, less polished - Negative, less flexible - Negative, less optimal assembly - Negative.

Wrong size!. I realize it must be difficult to actually write on a website that a product is incompatible with another product, but Ikea has accomplished this. Neither the short or long leg sets I bought work with either of my Kallax units. Terrible. Buyer beware.;Wrong size - Negative, incompatible - Negative.
Basic shelf. Some wobbliness, and the metal oddly enough is not as thick as my older versions!;Basic shelf - Neutral, wobbliness - Negative, metal thickness decreased - Negative.
Lovely Shelves to Display Plants. Shelves in front of 8' windows to display orchids and violets. Glass shelves allow light to lower levels.

Great except…. Got for my sewing room to store fabric and it works great except it doesn’t line up evenly with the studs in an American home, nor does it line up with the height of our electric sockets, so it is hard to plug in stuff.

Nice style. We've had this one for nearly a month, and it's definitely a good style. I wouldn't mind seeing an option for rectangular tall shelves for a larger display area. A couple inches wider on each shelf would've been perfect. However, it's sturdy and stylish and works well all together.;Good style - Positive, sturdy - Positive, larger display area - Neutral.
Great storage for vinyl. I was looking for something to display my vinyls and some statues/figures at the same time and these were a Great Wall mountable option.;Great storage - Positive, wall mountable - Positive.
Awful!. I bought two of this thing, bc i had an od version of the same thing that I liked a lot, a kallax i think it was. Thought this was the same thing, but its completely different and MUCH worse. Harder to put together, doesnt actually connect with thing that looks like a longer bookshelf. Just a massive downgrade.;Awful - Negative, harder to put together - Negative, doesn't connect - Negative.
Complete frustration . We bought 2 of  the eket cubbies to make a longer bookshelf. I loved the sleek look online and thought it would be a great addition to our home. We opened up the first box and started putting it together. It was much more difficult to figure out how to get it today because the directions absolutely suck. But, we finally figured it out. But to our dismay, one of the shelving holes were drilled too close together. We took the whole thing apart thinking that we messed something up, but we ended up right with the same problem. So we opened the next box and started putting it together only to have the exact same problem. Two with the exact same problem? I questioned my husband again if we screwed something up. He is convinced it’s a factory issue so back to ikea they go.  ;Sleek look (expected) - Neutral, confusing directions - Negative, drilled holes issue - Negative.

Great window seat/book shelf. The product was very easy to assemble. Holds a generous amount of books.;Window seat/book shelf - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, holds generous amount of books - Positive.
I couldn't imagine a poor quality shelf. I bought these shelves based on the many postitive reviews. I couldn't have been more dissappointed. The entire structural integrety is on small wooden dowels. The shelves do not support themselves, let alone put anything on them.  Based on this product alone, Sweeden should not be allowed into NATO.;Poor quality shelves - Negative, many positive reviews - Neutral, small wooden dowels - Neutral, does not support itself - Negative.
Cardboard inside the walls! Not solid particle board.. Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it. Ours got weaker and started to wobble, so I wanted to lay it down on its face to add metal braces to the back corners, and the thing just ripped apart under its own weight. I am glad it did because I can see now that the outer edge pieces are thin strips of MDF with cardboard filler! I can't believe they can sell this as a safe product.;Cardboard filler - Negative, thin strips of MDF - Negative, wobbled under weight - Negative, ripped apart - Negative.
Misaligned. Edge dowels won't go in all the way so the whole alignment is nearly a half inch off. If I hammer them in any harder the wood will bust.;Misaligned - Negative.
Dowels do not fit into shelves. I've put together several of the smaller Kallax shelves over the year with no problem. Unfortunately, with this unit the dowels are too large and do not fit in the shelves. I called to complain after ruining a couple of the shelves and dowels, was sent a new one and had the same problem. I had to redrill all the holes so the dowels would fit - very time consuming for what should be an easy assembly. Noticed this complaint in other reviews and should have paid attention.;Dowels do not fit - Negative, easy assembly - Neutral, ruining shelves - Negative.
A huge bummer. Nearly finished building it when one of the screws simply would not screw in so tried to turn it to try a different angle, and a bunch of the connecting wood pieces snapped and lodged inside the shelves, impossible to get out. So can't finish putting it together and wasted the $270. Just terrible.;Snapped connecting pieces - Negative, impossible to finish assembly - Negative, wasted money - Negative.
Solved storage problem in the. Solved storage problem in the kitchen.;Solved storage problem - Positive.
Nice product!. My daughter’s preferred clothing organization method is “put everything in laundry baskets.“ She needed a unit to stack her laundry baskets, this works perfectly for that!;Stacks laundry baskets - Positive.
The quality of wood is horrible.. The price wasn't worth it. The wood quality was not good. I had to sand and varnish because the surface of the wood was too sharp and had a lot of splinters. After assembly, the balance was not right.;Horrible wood quality - Negative, price not worth it - Negative, required sanding and varnishing - Negative.
Good, but ... Solid sturdy shelf, but why not include some hardware covers like most other brands?  It decreases the quality appearance to have silver hardware showing. Not that hard to assemble but it would go much faster if Ikea used a little extra ink on the instructions to mark the boards. ;Solid sturdy shelf - Positive, lack of hardware covers - Negative, not difficult to assemble - Neutral, unclear instructions - Neutral.
Defective batch. After finishing the assembly, the doors were not aligned at the same level. I returned the product and ordered a replacement, but unfortunately, encountered the same issue once again;Defective batch - Negative, doors not aligned - Negative.

Not too hard to put together.;Compliments office furniture -Positive, versatile - Positive, added inserts - Positive, not too hard to put together - Neutral.
Built an entire wall of shelving!. We used 6 units and three bases and constructed an entire wall of shelving. We used heavy duty threaded c-clamps to securely connect each pair of units together and to connect the resulting “stacks” together.   To save assembly time we used TaskRabbit to do the assembly. Well worth the $188 dollars. The Tasker did in two hours what would have taken us 6 hours.;Built an entire wall - Positive, heavy-duty c-clamps - Positive, saved assembly time - Positive.
Looks good. Looks good;Looks good - Positive.
Not worth it. I have been buying Kallax shelf since they first opened their store’s in Germany. So, many years. I used them in the garage, kids room and living room. The little cubbies are very useful and versatile. Over the years I noticed the shelf getting smaller and smaller. But now it’s enough. I will not buy them again. I will return these after coming back from my vacation. They are so not worth the money. Instructions are easy to follow and Putting them together was easy except that some of the dowels would just break off so easily, they feel like big toothpicks. I was not able to pull the broken ones out. They would just crumple as soon as my pliers touched them.  The entire shelf is so very light, it feels like I am using thick cardboard to assemble it. If you have children or pets you will definitely have to mount it to the wall.  As a consumer, at some point I have to say this is just cheap s… once put together forget about taking it apart….;Useful and versatile - neutral,instructions are easy to follow - neutral, durable - negative, getting smaller over the years - negative, lightweight - negative, easy to assemble - neutral, broken dowels - negative, not worth the money - negative.
Impossible to assemble. I’ve assembled many IKEA pieces of furniture in my life and this is by far the worst. The holes drilled were not deep enough for parts to fit together and we literally had to deepen them with a drill in order to assemble the bookcase. Usually a little banging with a hammer here and there solves the issue but the holes on the sides were about 3/8” short so no amount of hammering helped (and trust me we were so pissed we used quite a bit of force). I would have returned if it wasn’t such a hassle to bring everything back when I had to borrow a car from a friend and drive 30 miles to get this in the first place.;"Impossible to assemble - Negative, not deep enough holes - Negative

(Note that ""bookcase"" is a key characteristic, but it's already included in the context of the sentence, hence no need to list it again.)"
Quality & Aesthetic, Tricky Assembly. The unit itself now that it’s built is great, but there are so many components that look identical yet are actually every so slightly different that are easily mistaken for the correct piece, which leads to a lot of building, disassembling, and rebuilding;Quality unit - Positive, Aesthetic - Positive, Tricky assembly - Negative.
Very modern . This is such a clean and efficient storage module.  I only wish the cardboard boxes they make fit the cubes better.  (I also liked the metal trim and lable holders on the old cardboard boxes.  Fabric is good, but the sleek coated cardboard in various colors was nice as well.  Not find if the matt paper ones) Still, this is a great piece for so many things. I seem to remember it wasn’t as heavy many years ago.  The heaviness of the furniture isn’t good. ;Modern design - Positive, clean and efficient - Positive, wish boxes fit better - Neutative.
Cute unit. I purchased to set up as a coffee area station in my pantry to save working counter space. Works well. Typical Ikea set up but once we figured out the layout, switching the middle vertical post to the correct side, it was fine. Level was good. Just missing the magnet to hold a door shut and they are out of stock on the missing parts page of true website, so not sure how I will fix that.;Cute unit - Positive, saves counter space - Positive, typical Ikea setup - Neutral, missing magnet - Negative.
Great Piece!. This works so well in my space. I bought with the intention of using it in my office, but it is versatile so might move it around to change things up in other rooms.

Looks great but starting to sag . I love how this base elevates the Kallax, but unfortunately, after about a year I can see the top shelf is starting to detach caused by sagging in the middle. I thought this would be strong given it’s constructed of metal. It really needs a center leg to properly distribute the weight.  ;Elevates Kallax - Positive, Starting to sag - Negative.
Love it. This gold shelf-within-a-shelf is perfect for board books to fit more on the shelf, or anything else that isn’t tall enough to use the whole cubby, but you want to use some of that open space above.

the parts are different. I have 4 Kallax of various sizes in my house. I've never had a hard time building one before. I'm not sure what is different, maybe the wooden dowels are longer than they used to be or the holes are not as well made. This was the smallest one I've put together and it was such a pain. The dowels simply wouldn't go into the holes smoothly, even with all my weight (not inconsiderable) pushing in. I ended up using a rubber mallet that almost worked but dented the sides. I'm very disappointed.;Different parts - Neutral, building experience - positive, smooth assembly - Negative, dowels and holes - Negative.
Super handy!. We keep this under the table as a place to organize notebooks, laptops, and cables that have shown up now that we work from home. The casters are not very effective at keeping it in place.;Handy - Positive, organize notebooks, laptops, and cables - Positive, casters not effective - Negative.
The wood is soft so. The wood is soft so it does dent really easily. There are no caps to cover the screws so it’s a bit of an eyesore. Very sturdy.;Soft wood - Neutral, no covers for screws - Negative, sturdy - Positive.
Perfect display shelving. I bought this to display my LEGO CONSTRACTION Star Wars figures. I needed something that was the right spacing and would also allow light to get through.

So very nice. I wanted bookcase that were a bit more “upscale” than the very affordable Billy bookcases. I was so happy with the Havasta! Very sturdy- high quality.

Great. Great;This sentence is not descriptive enough to extract specific keyphrases and their sentiments.
Good Looks, BUT Tough Assembly. I have now assembled 8 shelf units and have found that in every unit there are at least 3 mis-alligned screw holes.

Got so many compliments! But this shelf wobbles!. I loved this so much I went back for another one! Great price and size. 50 mins to assemble for me.

Used this as a horizontal book shelf.. Bought a stand for this to be mounted on and it turned out perfect.;Used as horizontal book shelf - Neutral, turned out perfect - Positive.
Surprisingly Poor Construction. This is the first IKEA product series I have been sorely disappointed with. We have bought quite a few products from IKEA: desks, outdoor furniture, a bed, chairs, a dining room table, and quite a few others.  In most cases, the tolerances are quite good, and things fit tightly, so long as you follow the directions.   For both KALLAX shelves I bought, the problem is the dowels: following the directions, using a hammer, I inexplicably damaged both shelves because the dowels didn’t quite fit.  I do not recommend this at all. I am not returning it, due to the distance to the store. If it wasn’t so far, both would be going back.;Poor construction - Negative, damaged shelves - Negative, disappointed with product - Negative.

Kallax 4 cubby. I prefer to get the smaller 2-4 cube shelf units a they’re much easier to move around or if you’re having a manic moment in the middle of the night and want to rearrange the entire room. It’s far better to move smaller shelves than the larger 8+ units. … was it worth the price? Mmm I’m pretty sure these used to be around 30ish bucks but now they’re back up to 40 to 60 rounded up. I’d appreciate if they were 34 dollars  and wouldn’t spike up in cost more than 5 bucks. Idk that’s just me ;Smaller cubby units - Positive, easier to move - Positive, worth the price - Neutral, preferred price point - Neutral
Great for LP storage. I bought a few of these in the 8-cube configuration a long time ago to store vinyl records and loved them. I heard that IKEA discontinued them years ago and recently found out that they started making them again. The new edition is not quite as sturdy as the originals but are still very good. The outside frame is a little more narrow and the whole unit is slightly lighter, but the old ones were probably heavier than they needed to be so this shouldn't be a big deal. Happy with both the quality and the value. ;Great for LP storage - Positive, 8-cube configuration - Neutral, sturdy - Positive, high quality - Positive, good value - Positive.

Wrong color in box!. I purchased a second Kallax unit in the black color to match the one I already own. The sticker on the box indicated that the color was black. The pieces inside were white.

Glossy finish off-putting. I love the shape, design. But the mounting is not functional. The security brackets are not spaced for both to hit studs, so the expectation is that one would be in a stud and one in an anchor. I decided to wall-mount mine, so I placed brackets on the bottom. It looks great on the wall. And finally, the finish is glossy, almost glassy, which clashes a little with my eggshell walls. Not a deal-breaker, but not what I was hoping for.;Love shape and design - Positive, mountains not functional - Negative, glossy finish - Neutral.
So cute . These shelves made my kitchen cute;Cute shelves - Positive.
High gloss white is not white it’s UGLY yellow white. The high gloss white is yellowish not a true white and it looks disgusting with the blue pansartax boxes, not to mention it was originally delivered without the base, I ended up having to order another base and pay delivery twice because customer service would have had me wait a week, one of the boards arrived damaged to top it all off but the worst part is honestly the color and the fact that it’s so complicated to construct that you can’t return;High gloss white - Negative, yellowish tone - Negative, complicated assembly - Negative, no base included - Negative.

Great storage addition to my sewing room!. I bought this little shelf for my sewing room to provide more storage as well as provide an ironing surface. With this shelf being at counter height, I can easily add a do-it-yourself ironing board to the top! (plywood+batting+pretty fabric) This will make this piece even more versatile, which is great! My husband put it together for me and was surprised it just snapped together. He did come across one broken piece that he had to go exchange at our local IKEA, but out of all the items we have purchased, this has been the only instance of that happening.

like the drawers better. Aligning and securing the Kallax door was little hard . You have to make a new hole on the shelf and then screw the door unit on.;Prefer drawers - Positive, difficult door alignment - Negative.
Brackets not spaced for wall studs. I think this shelf is perfect. I only wish the brackets were spaced for wall studs. They the way they are, only one mounting screw hits a stud. The other side must rely on a dry wall anchor.;Perfect shelf - Positive, brackets not spaced for studs - Negative.
Very happy! . Priced right. Looks good! Works great. Added wood glue for insurance, but could be fine without ;Priced right - Positive, looks good - Positive, works great - Positive.
NOT HAPPY - NEED TO RUIN BOOKCASE TO USE. I am not happy with these as you need to screw them into your bookshelf which will put holes into your unit. Returning as I had not open these yet but opened the drawer ones which is the same. I think IKEA should put this in the description. Will never understand why they changed them.;Need to screw in - Negative.
Super easy to build. I am a 13 year old and this was very simple to build! I only needed my dad’s help twice!! The end result is super nice it is great! im on my dads account btw;Easy to build - Positive, great end result - Positive.
Drawers. Good;Drawers - Neutral.
"Not for Older Models. I bought my Kallax 2010and just brought this base, but found that the screw hole does not align. I compared it to the newer Kallax model and found the older model has thicker sideboards. I wish Ikea had a sign that says ""for models from 20xx-20××""."; Older models - Negative, screw hole alignment issue - Negative, comparable to newer model - Neutral.
Simple and sturdy. Purchased as a storage shelf. It's solid and the lip on the back of the shelves help keep items secured;Simple design - Neutral, sturdy construction - Positive, secures items - Positive.
damaged parts. I did a click and collect on this item. After driving 5 hours round trip, I got home to put it together and one of the sides was really damaged. I ended up putting it together but needed zip ties and had to hammer out the flat pieces.;Damaged parts - Negative.
Perfect addition to my Kallax shelves. I have several Kallax shelves holding vinyl LP albums. I just added another to my media room for board games. I am glad they make a consistent product from year to year. Even the color matches. The drawers are great accessories. I'm using them for decks and games pieces. Perfect.;Consistent product - Positive, perfect addition - Positive, great accessories - Positive, decks and games pieces - Neutral, color matches - Positive.
they fit perfectly in the space needed. They are light and bright and sturdy;Fit perfectly - Positive, light - Neutral, bright - Neutral, sturdy - Positive.
Easy to assemble, looks great. Purchased this to hold plants in front of a long window. Very easy to assemble, looks neat and clean while letting the plants shine. Able to store plant food, watering can, etc on lower shelf. Very convenient.;Easy to assemble - Positive, Looks great - Positive, lets plants shine - Positive, convenient - Positive.
Great for closet. It fits in my closet. Waiting for the taller 4 unit on stock. It really helps organize your closet. Waiting for the inserts to place my shoes next.;Fits in closet - Positive, helps organize closet - Positive.
Who owns a glass punch?. The instructions were… fine, but it did not come with a glass punch (?) that you’re supposed to use on step 18 to screw into the glass. I have thousands of dollars of tools and no glass punch. Also, the end product is wobbly.; No glass punch included - Negative, end product is wobbly - Neutral.
Great product. Easy to assemble;Great product - Positive, easy assembly - Positive.

Great storage for crafting supplies . My wife used this for all of her craft and sewing projects ;Great storage - Positive, crafting supplies - Neutral.
So much quality. I made a whole wall of the cubbies.  They are versatile,  sturdy and beautiful.   I have the desk attached it is wonderful.   I have used a sewing machine and the ceramic items and statues didn't even jiggle.   Recommend for everyone. ;Quality - Positive, versatile - Positive, sturdy - Positive, beautiful - Positive.
NOT fit old Kallax shelf unit!!. I have two Kallax shelf units of the same size, measuring 30 3/8 by 57 7/8 inches, which I bought at different times. One is high gloss white, and the other one is regular white. The base legs can only be installed with the white unit, which I purchased about two years after the gloss white one. The part number 10081882/10081773, which is designed to connect the Kallax unit to the legs, is shorter and cannot reach the holes on the old high gloss Kallax unit. but the product detail information here mentioned it fit all KALLAX unit. which is not true!;Not fit old Kallax shelf - Negative, base legs - Neutral, product detail information - Negative.
Great Office Addition. I use Kallax on its side to create an L-shaped desk in my new office. It has worked great. Was very easy and quick to assemble.;Great office addition - Positive, L-shaped desk - Positive, easy assembly - Positive.
Perfect for NEWER Kallax Shelving. I love the way this elevates the look of these shelves (and literally lifts them off the floor, so they’re less dusty).   Be careful! If you have Kallax shelves that were purchased several years back. IKEA changed the design several years ago, and the outer dimensions are about an inch off. Mine are slightly bigger than the current Kallax shelves, so these legs don’t actually mount properly. I was able to screw them into my slightly larger version and use them.;Elevates look - Positive, saves from dust - Positive, compatible with newer Kallax shelves - Positive, caution required - Neutral.
Kallax. Very sturdy using it as a dresser in a small room ;Sturdy - Positive, using as dresser - Neutral.
Doors. Great quality. Good looks. Easy to assemble.;Great quality - Positive, Good looks - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive.
Very nice wall unit at a great price. Easy to assemble, thoughtful design, sturdy and attractive;Great price - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive, Thoughtful design - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, Attractive - Positive.
A little wobbly. This is the second vittsjo I’ve purchased in the last few years and this one seems to wobble and sway a bit. I recommend anchoring to the wall. I’ve assembled a lot of ikea furniture and the like over the years, so pretty confident I assembled this correctly.;Wobbly - Negative, needs wall anchoring - Neutary.
Perfect Fit. Easy to put together. Fits my needs exactly. Simple and clean.;Easy put-together - Positive, perfect fit - Positive, simple and clean - Positive.
Old style was better. While the doors are functional and look good I gave 2 stars because the quality has certainly declined. Walls are now made of cardboard rather than the sturdy construction of previous models. Difficult to install due to screws tearing cardboard walls before ever making it flush onto the kallax cube wall.;Functional doors - Neutral, look good - Neutral, quality has declined - Negative, made of cardboard - Negative, difficult installation - Negative.
Was not what I thought it would be. Once assembled it get rather flimsy for books. Better off getting a billy bookcase or similar for heavy objects. It would be great for decor and Knick knacks.;Not as expected - Negative, rather flimsy - Negative.
Nice for the price. I decided to organize and create a smaller footprint for the toys the grandkids play with when they come over. This works great. The 13 by 13 cubes are very spacious. I do recommend fastening it to the wall if in the upright position because the little ones definitely try to climb it.;Affordable - Positive, spacious cubes - Positive, recommend wall mounting - Positive.
Wish this was available in all colors!. This would be a perfect option for my use but it doesn’t come in the black brown color so I’ll be looking for other options outside of IKEA;Availble in all colors - Neutral, perfect option - Positive, black brown color - Negative.
Fabulous. I made a wall to wall bookcase in my old home. Then there was no  extra  frame with legs. This is a relief since it makes it easy to clean below the bookcase.  Love it!;Wall-to-wall bookcase - Positive, no extra frame - Positive.
Great shelf for smaller spaces. This shelf had the exact dimensions I needed to fit a small space. It was perfect to keep all my flour bins in the kitchen. Keep in mind that the metal shelves are extremely thin and can dent easily. So take care when assembling the unit!!;Small space - Positive, exact dimensions - Positive, thin metal shelves - Neutive, can dent easily - Caution.
"Kallax Shelf Unit. I already purchased one of these for another room; so, I knew what I was getting. Really STURDY and very handsome. I didn't have any problems putting this piece together. I have all my sewing books in there.";Really sturdy - Positive, handsome design - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, stores sewing books - Neutral.
Excellent value for this product family!. I like this size for kids toys and end tables.  I can put one of these together in about 20 minutes taking my time.  I am a Kallax fan.  We have purchased many sizes with various inserts over the years, and we have never been disappointed.  I think my favorite is the black brown with doors and drawers.  My kids prefer the lighter color units with colored inserts (especially the green metal doors offered several years ago.)  The lighter colors don't require as many touchups over the years, but touching up scratches isn't difficult if you're crafty. We have used permanent marker and paint to good effect.  If your product is damaged or missing parts when you get home, IKEA will make it right.  They have even mailed parts to my house.  Reach out to customer service and see what your options are.;Excellent value - Positive, likes size - Neutral, assembly time - Positive, Kallax fan - Positive, favorite color - Neutimental, scratch coverage - Positive, customer service - Positive.
Kallax cube storage. These are the best! I wish I had more of them.;Best Kallax cube storage - Positive.

Good for small space . I like it; Small space - Positive, I like it - Positive.
Havsta open shelves. Beautiful, open shelves for displaying framed photos and books. Shelves are very thick and sturdy. I love this piece of furniture. I plan on adding 1 more piece of Havsta furniture to the living area for closed storage to have a beautiful, coordinated look.;Open shelves - Positive, beautiful - Positive, thick and sturdy - Positive, for displaying photos and books - Neutral, closed storage - Negative (as it was mentioned as a separate piece), coordinated look - Positive.
Really Tough to Assemble . Shelf looks great and functions well after it's put together but it was really difficult to assemble by myself. The wood shelf's are not predrilled so you have to apply a ton of pressure to get the screws in. I ended up using Bungie cords to hold the shelf in place while I added the screws. This would've been easier if I had clamps or a second person applying pressure.;Difficult assembly - Negative, looks great - Positive, functions well - Positive, wood shelves - Neutral.
Perfect fit. I needed something for storage that would fit under my large window. I was rearranging my craft room and didn't have enough storage. Kallax + bins and done! I'll put a cushion on top and the cat will be able to look out at squirrels all day!;Perfect fit - Positive, large window storage - Positive, fits under window - Positive, Kallax shelves - Positive.
Love this shelf. This pice creates a functional shelf and adds to the look and storage of the Kallie cube unit. Awesome price and unbelievably easy to put together. ;Functional shelf - Positive, adds to look - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, affordable - Positive.
"Perfect find. I was looking for a shelf of some sort for my printer/extra office supplies. The Billy bookcases were much too narrow and the Kallax were too chunky for the space I needed it in. This cart is the perfect compromise! The Pudda baskets fit perfectly in the square compartments, and I’ve got spare paper, notebooks, etc on the shelves. The quality was also surprising; I’m used to most Ikea furniture coming with a super thin board you nail in to the back, but the back of this is sturdy and could certainly be exposed in the room. Thanks for this piece, Ikea! Hopefully there will be a broader color range in the future.";Perfect compromise - Positive, suitable size - Positive, sturdy back - Positive.
Perfect fit. We love the quality. I used it as a room seperator. ;Perfect fit - Positive, love the quality - Positive.
Office Space (sans Bill Lumbergh). Versatile. Functional. 8 years and counting. KALLAX is a killer line.;Versatile - Positive, Functional - Positive, killer line - Neutral, Long lasting - Positive.
Also good as a TV Stand if you don't want to put your TV at a too low position. I bought this as my TV Stand, because I don't want to put the TV at a too low position. It works well. The depth of the frame can hold a 55 inch Samsung S95B and a Bose S700 soundbar (it is not too slim to place a big TV with wide/deep stand). The heights between the 3 boards are good enough to put Playstation 5 / Xbox game consoles vertically as well. It is easy for us to have wires through (of course, not so good to hide those wires because there is no such a whole board at the back). The structure is solid enough.  Assembling is OK. Although the structure is simple and clear, there are too many screws to put in. I finally forfeit one of them since I am sure it doesn't hurt at all without that screw. Designers should simplify that more if possible. On Pricing perspective, a little expensive for $179.;Functional as TV stand - Positive, can hold large TV and soundbar - Positive, easy wire access - Neutral, solid structure - Positive, simple assembling with excessive screws - Negative, expensive - Neutral.
Perfect organizer. So, my daughter and two grands are visiting and need somewhere to place personals and clothing items. This unit works perfect and adds to the decor of the room. We currently have a wicker day bed and TV with a few accent items. The organizer is the right fit.;Perfect organizer - Positive, fits decor - Positive.
Love these drawers. I originally bought these drawers when I bought Kallax cube unit. Installing the drawers and building the 8 cube unit was easy. I loved the drawers so much I actually ordered another set. They give the unit a different look and are functional as additional storage! ;Love these drawers - Positive, additional storage - Positive, easy installation - Positive.
KALLAX is one of the. KALLAX is one of the best storage systems on the market.;Best storage systems - Positive, KALLAX is one of the - Positive.
"Love! Perfect shelf for my little plant collection. . It’s exactly what I was looking for. It’s aesthetically pleasing and I love the natural look with the white. It has a good weight to it and I feel it will hold up well, as long as I don’t put too much stuff on it. The metal shelving is extremely convenient since plants tend to be messy and drop water all of the time, making for easy cleaning. I also love the spacing between the shelves because they’re the perfect width apart where I can add smaller plants on the lower levels. Absolutely in love. It was also extremely easy to install; I used a drill to ensure it was sturdy.

Beautiful color. Easy to assemble, stacks nicely, perfect;Beautiful color - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, stacks nicely - Positive.
Always a Versatile Favorite. We wanted two eight cube units and the store was sold out so we bought four of the four cube units and what was a disappointment at first worked out to be a plus. We place two together but now have the ability to split them up in different places in the room, move one to another room, etc. They are solid and not difficult to assemble.;Four cube units - Previously a disappointment but turned out to be a plus - Neutral, solid - Positive, not difficult to assemble - Positive.
Got another one.. Great little shelf - I already had one and got another for the upstairs hallway. ;Great little shelf - Positive.
Love love love eket!. When we redid our daughters’ room we needed to replace their Kallax bookshelf with something only slightly narrower. I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the eket is smaller, it holds way more books! This would be because the inner and outer walls are thinner. The eket takes some more muscle to put together than kallax but you can get more functionality from the eket. Plus we liked that they have backs so our kids don’t lose things in the abyss behind the unit. Also included are the stand-off posts so it can be flush against your floor trim and the wall! My new favorite go-to piece!;Eket - Positive, holds more books - Positive, functional - Positive, includes stand-off posts - Positive.
Handy little shelf. One nice extra touch that you might not notice on the picture is that it has leveling feet.  I’m using mine as a plant shelf - the metal shelves are nice because they do get a little wet when I mist my plants.;Handy little shelf - Positive, leveling feet - Positive, plant shelf - Neutral, metal shelves - Neutral.
Wine storage. Excellent fit. Wish there were other colors but worked perfect.;Excellent fit - Positive, wish other colors - Neutral.
Solid pine construction. Expected another particle board furniture. This is solid pine. The stain and finish are amazing. The furniture is very strong (why the box is so heavy).;Solid pine construction - Positive, amazing stain and finish - Positive.
Kallax white gloss bookcases . I love these to store all my books. They are very sturdy once attached to the wall. I must say that they are not as nice as the Expedit units they replaced. They’re a bit thinner overall but still have the same interior dimensions to fit larger books. Easy to assemble except the sticky plastic  protective strips were an absolute pain to peel off. It took longer to peel all that off than to actually put the units together. Very annoying! Other than that, I would definitely recommend them. I have hundreds of books and I love how organized and beautiful everything looks. I will be trimming them out with base, trim and crown molding for a built in look.;Sturdy once attached to wall - Positive, love to store books - Positive, interior dimensions - Neutral, easy to assemble - Neutive, annoying protective strips - Negative, will trim for built in look - Positive.
Perfect sewing table!. I am using it as a sewing table. Instead of having the shelf upright, I laid it on its side and I have an L-shaped sewing table. The table is study enough for sewing and I have canvas storage bins underneath to hide materials.;Sewing table - Positive, study - Positive.
Just what we needed!!. We needed a large bookcase to fit under our windows. when turned on the side, it fit perfectly. And because the cubbies are square, it did not affect the space. If you follow the directions, the bookcase will go together easily. It is quite sturdy. Perfect!!;Large bookcase - Positive, fits under windows - Positive, cubbies are square - Positive, makes assembly easy - Positive, sturdy - Positive.
Exceeded my expectation. I hesitated buying it because of the price and there was no sample on the floor. I took a chance and came back because the shelving unit looks bland. I was surprise how well the construction, sleekness and it has a soft close mechanism. A definite add-on and the pricing in my opinion makes sense.;Exceeded expectation - Positive, constructed well - Positive, sleek design - Positive, soft close mechanism - Positive.
Cute and functional. Terrible to put together.. Holes for screws do not line up MOST of the time. Very difficult to put together involving much swearing and a need for power tools.;Cute - Positive, functional - Positive, difficult to assemble - Negative.

it's fine... but definitely a re-engineered version of previous purchase. I have purchased 8 cube storage shelving several times in the past and have always enjoyed the option of adding casters to the bottom to make them easily moveable. I didnt realize this was no longer an option. I was disappointed to find the boards are now hollow and in order to attach casters I was forced to improvise.;Previously had casters - Negative, hollow boards - Neutral.
Hmmmm, on the fence here.. I have the old expedit shelving that wasn’t put together exactly like they were supposed to. Close enough to work as shelving but not great for thr insets. I also bought the drawers for them although they’re not ‘fixed’ and I can take them out as needed. I have to say I was expecting a better quality door insert. This looks and feels more like cardboard! The drawer inserts are much more substantial and I had expected that for the doors! Lets mot EVEN talk about the directions and of how little help they are! Did’t realize the door assembly would be so difficult! Ah well, I’ll put them together another day!;Old expedit shelving - Neutral, not great for inserts - Neutative, bought drawers - Positive, door inserts - Negative, expected better quality - Negative, assembly instructions - Negative.

Ample shelf space. Great value for your money.. I was looking for another item i saw online but decided on purchasing this one instead when I saw it in person at the showroom.

Our favorite furnishing. Kallex cubes are all over our house. We love them that much. Most recent purchase included two double cube and a single cube we are using as sturdy plant stands to keep away from new rescue pug that wants to eat everything. Only negative is that I think single cube is overpriced compared to others (which are a great value for the money). Versatility with drawers, doors, bottle inserts and bins is a a big plus. (I wish there were glass doors, though.);Favorite furnishing - Positive, Kallex cubes - Positive, sturdy plant stands - Positive, versatility with drawers, doors, bottle inserts and bins - Positive, overpriced single cube - Negative.
Great addition to the living room. This is a great shelf, very sturdy and creates a nice divide between the living room and our dinner table. I can confidently place my small speakers and plants without worrying if I bump into it.;Great addition - Positive, sturdy - Positive, creates divide - Positive, confidently place items - Positive.
Utilitarian with simple style. I got this in the As Is section of the store (my favorite!)  I didn't realize it was meant to be a TV stand until I looked it up later. I'm using it as an end piece for my IKEA Vallentuna sleeper sofa because it fits perfectly, and the glass middle shelf lets light get to the bottom shelf, where I have some ceramic decorations.  The only thing is that because it was As Is, there's permanent marker on it with some identification info, which I wish the employee hadn't done because it won't come off, though that's not an issue with this product specifically.;Utilitarian - Positive, simple style - Positive, glass middle shelf - Positive, used as TV stand - Neutral, identification info - Neutral.

Misleading and disappointing.. I didn't realize this piece was just three different pieces put together, and that's on me, but that being said, I had issues with every piece. All the pieces are made to go together without tools, and that relies on the pieces fitting just right, and they do not. Even when I got them to slide into place they weren't flush at the corners. The instructions were beyond confusing because Ikea now refuses to put any words in their instructions and only one piece in every box was labeled at all. On the other hand, the feet required a power drill to install, and I can't see that reflected anywhere in the description. I decided not to use them, which would have been fine except I paid like $15 more for them to be included in the bundle. There was also no way that I could see to pysically attach the cubes to each other. This is my third failed Ikea build-turned-return in a row, and I'm confident in my assembly abilities. I've loved ikea for years, but they have lost my business.;Three pieces - Neutral, misleading - Negative, pieces don't fit well - Negative, instructions confusing - Negative, required power tool - Negative, failed build - Negative.
Chips easily. This is interesting to put together where it doesn’t hold by itself and kind of have to shimmy in the unit. In putting it together it chipped and I was being careful and didn’t drop it. For the price I wouldn’t recommend.;Easily chipped - Negative.
Just right. For something so light and easily assembled, and moderately priced, this shelf is really quite sturdy. I'm using it for plants, so the open design is perfect. The spacing between shelves is generous. I may buy another (but that would lead to buying more plants...);Light and easily assembled - Positive, moderately priced - Neutral, sturdy - Positive, open design - Positive, generous spacing - Positive.

Great shelf, poor delivery. The Kallax shelf is a great and versatile bookshelf. I'm using it to display heavy books and collectibles. The different configuration options allow me to customize the unit(s) to fit my exact needs. The IKEA delivery service however was not so great. IKEA used a 3rd party delivery company that left much to be desired. The delivery was rescheduled twice and communication was inconsistent and confusing. I received text messages from the company informing me that the delivery was 30 minutes away put the gps link showed the truck at least 90 minutes away. Later the delivery was cancelled and rescheduled. When the order finally did come I received another text informing me it was 30 minutes away and immediately after a text saying delivery complete.;Great shelf - Positive, versatile - Positive, poor delivery - Negative.

great upgrade. I wish the drawers were a little deeper, seems like the walls could be a few inches taller for even more capacity but they are a great upgrade to the single deep bin I had before. They were very easy to install and I want to complement the designers on how it's almost impossible to assemble them incorrectly because each hole and screw is different. Everything came together nicely. I struggled a bit with attaching the insert to the Kallax frame because I don't have strong enough hands to screw into the particle board but will borrow an electric screwdriver and I'm sure that'l take care of it. ;Great upgrade - Positive, Wish for deeper drawers - Neutral, Wish for taller walls - Neutral, Easy installation - Positive, Impossible to assemble incorrectly - Positive.
easy to install and functional. These inserts allowed me to sort some fabric rolls for easer access. I found the bin too deep and it quickly got so cluttered. This way my rolls are organized for easy access and less wrinkles. ;Easy to install - Positive, functional - Positive, fabric roll organization - Positive.
Great addition to make Kallax even more effective. I've enjoyed the upgrade of Kallax. I added drawers, this shelf and the crisscross. My sewing supplies are not much more accessible. I found the large bins too deep and stuff just tended to gather on the bottom, things got wrinkled. Now everything has it's own place and is much more accessible. ;Great addition - Positive, more effective - Positive, added drawers - Neutral, sewing supplies accessible - Positive.

"Kallax for record albums. I like the kallax, especially with the riser.

I did it myself! XD. This is the first time I have built an IKEA furniture. Normally my son does it for me. He is a Navy sailor and has been away from home. I wanted to remodel his room and bought this shelf to display his model cars etc. I wanted the white shelf but mistakenly took the natural wood. I was going to return it but the color was a better fit for the bedroom theme. Not to mention how easy it was to put together. I'm making a list of other pieces I wanted but found intimidating. ;First time assembling IKEA furniture - Neutral, bought for displaying model cars - Positive, mistakenly bought natural wood - Neutitive, easier to put together than expected - Positive.
"Hard to assemble if you don't follow the directions.. Follow the directions! Pay attention to the ""1"" printed on one of the pieces and get a rubber mallet and these can be assembled in 2 mins.  I first tried these without reading the directions as it was only 5 pieces. It was a nightmare. You can do the first 3 sides and then slide the particle board in and then you will spend 1hr plus losing your mind, patience, temper, etc swearing the product is defective. I even broke one trying to jam it in as it just wouldn't line up... However, my wife then asked if I followed the directions and I didn't even look at them. She then took it and followed the directions and assembled multiple of them in 2 minutes :) lol you just have to pay attention to the directions and the ""1"" and they are so easy to do but use a rubber mallet with a cloth to make it easier - thanks wife.  Hope this helps.";Difficult assembly - Negative, Follow directions - Positive, easy assembly with directions - Positive, rubber mallet required - Neutional.
Dimensionally Wrong Construction. This is the worst ikea product I’ve ever had so far. It doesn’t fit last part and ridiculously doesn’t make sense. Please listen to the reviews that are similar to mine.;Dimensionally wrong - Negative, worst product - Negative.
Frustrated!. Just bought this unit today and was excited to put it together. Talk about frustrating! Bad instructions and I couldn't get it assembled with the back panel in place. Once you align the plastic screws on 3 sides and slide in the back panel it is impossible to get the screws on the 4th side lined up AND in line with the back panel! Dinged it up a bit with my effort. Hardest piece from Ikea that I've ever tried to assemble. So disappointed!;Bad instructions - Negative, impossible assembly - Negative, disappointed - Negative.
Difficult to assemble. I read the reviews and the difficult the cabinet is to assemble but I bought it anyway, which I don't completely regret because I live the design, but I'll definitely have to get a real rabbit person to assist. The directions for mounting the shelf are especially vague.;Difficult to assemble - Negative, vague directions - Negative, desire for assistance - Neutral, liked design - Positive.
If You Can Put It Together...Pieces Do Not Align Well. This piece would have been a beautiful storage option , if you can put it together that is. After trying for a few weeks, I just was not able to put these cubes together. The video provided on product's page isn't near close to reality, and customer service just recommends using Task Rabbit. There's something about these units that are not correctly lining up so that they can slide and lock into place. Ultimately, and unfortunately have to make the trek to return.;Could not assemble - Negative, beautiful storage option - Neutive, pieces do not align - Negative.
Almost impossible to build. The assembly process almost took me down. Down to a sad, dark, dark place. In lieu of regular screws, it is necessary to wedge into place plastic screws that required maximum force to set into place — including sitting on it, jumping on it with the full force of a grown adult, and ultimately banging it at full intensity and speed with a hammer, which admittedly provided an outlet for the pent up frustration. Do not buy this unless you are ready to face the ultimate challenge;Impossible assembly - Negative, plastic screws - Neutral, required maximum force - Negative.

Low value for price. A bit upset as it’s chipped in two places while careful my putting it together. It has weight to it but it’s now ugly from the chips. It took some time to get it in the init. I also would like if it had a back without having to purchase a door. The unit being opened in the back means things can fall behind it.

So many uses!. I have many of the Kallax of different sizes in our house. It is great that with the addition of doors or drawers and new hardware you can make it fit into so many different styles and uses!!

Nice Craft Table Option. Well-built and thought out. We set ours up vertically. The hardware kit comes with two shelf braces, so the table doesn't rely too heavily on the wood shelf it's mounted on. The bookshelf also comes with wall anchors which I highly recommend if you have children using this. It was easy to install. Took a little bit of effort to level the legs. TIP: to start, lay the table face down with legs up and adjust the height of the legs to the shelf that you want to mount to. From there, when you flip it, you can adjust and level. All holes are pre-drilled for you except where the table bracket mounts to the shelf and where the braces will mount under each shelf, but the little screws are pretty well-self tapping. I piloted the first few and then found out I can just put pressure and turn them in manually. This is WAY WAY sturdier and well built than then the lame Walmart Better Homes and Garden version that I previously purchased and promptly returned.;Well-built table - Positive, easy installation - Positive, sturdy construction - Positive, comes with hardware kit - Positive, wall anchors - Positive, adjustable legs - Positive.
Versatile cubbies. We installed 3 above my daughter's desk for books and mini stereo system, and another 3 on a wall to display items. They look great!

"Perfect. We've recently moved into an incredibly small apartment. The kitchen hardly has any cupboard space at all and we were seriously lacking space for our food. The little ""pantry"" they gave us now holds our plastics and appliances. We didn't have any counter space for our microwave, toaster, or toaster oven. Not to mention the lack of space for our dry goods. We bought this and two of the 2x6 kallax shelves to put on either side of it. Now we have all the room we need, plus the top of this for our three appliances we use often. It has plenty of space for stacking cans and keeping cereal boxes.

Just OK. I'm not sure who gave the 5-star ratings. But, while simple enough to construct, peeling the thin plastic off the shelve edges takes longer than construction.  If they had a tab to grab it would have been OK, But with nothing to get you started, you struggle for a long time on each section to peel them. I had bought this in the past and didn't have to deal with the protective coverings.

I couldn't find mine anywhere but after putting one together without one and getting frustated, I realized that Ikea made these to fit so tightly together it's just not worth doing it without. I ran to my local hardware store. 2: START WITH SIDE LABELED 1! The easiest way for me to see it was keeping the four sides together and looking for 1. But 1 is ALWAYS a piece with plastic pegs. ALWAYS. The pieces without pegs are what I think of as sides 2 & 3. 3: When putting on sides 2, put the round peg all the way into the round hole, if you only get it halfway in and slide; take it out; do it again. After the round peg is in the round hole, I grabbed the eket booklet, put it on top of the joint I was joining & pounded it until it was flat. This worked without fail. Repeat for side 3. 4: Slide the backing in sticker on the outside. Put side 4 in";Not hard - Positive, assembly tips - Neutral, need a mallet - Positive, plastic pegs - Neutral, slippery round pegs - Neutral.

Lesser quality than previous years. For anyone who has bought these over the years, you can immediately tell that the quality has gone down significantly from years past. Most of the wood is now semi-hollow and made of particle board basically. If you tighten a screw too much, it can easily break loose - the wood fails long before there is any chance of hurting the screw.  These obviously still work, and provide what I need, but I do not expect my recent purchase of these to last as long as my older purchases of the same item.;Lesser quality - Negative, particle board - Neutral, semi-hollow wood - Neutral, screws break easily - Negative.

Works fine but not perfect. 1. I really want to see other color options, matching all colors available for Kallax cubes. 2. I'd also love to see more configurations, because 1 shelf is too generous, and 3 shelves are too tight for my needs (sheet music). May be, pre-drilled inserts with additional shelves sold separately to allow configurations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 shelves at customer discretion. 3.

A little disappointed.. The Kallax cube divider works horizontally or vertically. There were a couple cubes the divider was an extremely difficult to get in and other cubes it slid right in.

Nice, but don't deviate. It's hard to compete with Ikea. Great looks, great price. I purchased thinking this line - Eket and Kallax, were compatible with each other. No, that's not the case at all.

Kallax Drawers. Already had the shelving unit, the drawers fit really well. It's nice that you can change up the unit and reconfigure it.;Fit well - Positive, change up unit - Positive.
Just the right size. Very sturdy. . The Kallax hold LPs. It is just the right size. Great way to display your albums!;Just the right size - Positive, Very sturdy - Positive.
Wobbly. This shelf looks nice and offers the storage that I needed, but it is super wobbly - like moves at least an inch side to side wobbly. I’m debating if I want to go through the hassle of exchanging it or just deal with the wobbly-ness…;Nice look - Neutral, wobbly - Negative, offers storage - Positive.
Wobbly. Extremely wobbly. Screws are tighted as best they can. Difficult to assemble, will need a drill bit to create holes for screws.;Wobbly - Negative, Difficult to assemble - Negative, requires drill bit - Neutral.
The Perfect Desk!. This desk came in different sizes and was perfect for the space I needed. It has a lot of storage shelves without looking bulky. SO glad I bought!!!;Perfect desk - Positive, different sizes - Positive, lot of storage - Positive, glad I bought - Positive.

Good Quality for Price!. I own multiple of these shelves, and they have been pretty sturdy and help up so far. The quality seems pretty good and it is easy to clean and maintain.  Pros: + Easy to assemble. + Bars and glass shelves feel sturdy. + Looks good / simple to fit into most places.  Cons: - Wooden top and bottom shelf panels can scratch easily (but like typical Ikea furniture). - You cannot buy replacement parts individually if something breaks.;Good quality for price - Positive, sturdy - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, easy to clean - Positive, wooden top and bottom shelf panels can scratch - Neutral, cannot buy replacement parts individually if something breaks - Negative.

Update is good, not great. I'd purchased Kallax door inserts some years ago, and at the time they were difficult to position and added a lot of weight to the shelves. The new version is much lighter and easier to position and attach, but the material beyond the door is a bit too flimsy. One of the new doors doesn't quite match up with the frame, and on none of the doors does the silicon bumper make a difference in noise emitted by closing it. But I like them anyway!;Easier to attach door inserts - Positive, lighter material - Neutral, poor door fit - Negative, flexible material beyond door - Neutral, no difference in noise reduction - Neutral, like the product despite its flaws - Positive.
An Interesting and Useful Piece. I didn't believe the IKEA guy when he said that it could easily hold 33 lbs. It is so lightweight, smooth and pretty, and I had no idea what it was when I saw it on my way to check out, but maybe it could solve the problem of my microwave oven cord being too short to fit any of my electric outlets while placed on any counter or current furniture. Actually, it is built to hold up to 50 lbs. It fit under the end of my breakfast bar near the electric outlet, and my microwave fits neatly on top. The cubbies below can hold items too big for my cupboards. It wipes off nicely.; Lightweight - Neutral, smooth and pretty - Neutral, holds 33 lbs - Positive, holds up to 50 lbs - Positive, microwave holder - Positive, wipes off easily - Positive.
. I bought this a couple of days ago and when I opened the boxes, I only found the wooden parts. There were no assembly instructions. Also the hardware parts like the screws and stuff was missing. How am I supposed to assemble it now??;Wooden parts - Neutral, missing assembly instructions - Negative, missing hardware - Negative.
Best shelf ever ... I have 3 of this shelf and I loved the quality;Best shelf - Positive, loved quality - Positive.
Kallax. Good for storing my vinyl albums. ;Good for storing vinyl albums - Positive.
Bad engineered design. . These are nice from the way they look, however, the engineering appears to be done by someone who had a brief lapse in the basics of physics.  Specifically, three sides connect together by aligning preset connectors into pre-drilled holes then sliding about 1/2 in. to lock into place.  You then slide the back piece into a pre-cut groove in each of the three sides.  Easy-peasy.  The problem arises when attaching the final side.  As the starting position to align the connectors to the pre-drilled holes is about 1/2 higher than the final placement once the connecters are slid into the locking position, the back does not therefore line up with the pre-cut groove in the final piece  This prevents the connectors from being able to fully go into the pre-drilled holes, and not allowing then to slide down into locked position.    Extremely, extremely frustrating.  Simple pre-drilled holes and screws would make a tighter fit and take minutes to assemble. ;Bad engineered design - Negative, nice looking - Neutral.
I love it. Love it but I’m not super handy and we didn’t realize we needed to make holes in the 2 boards but I did it.;Love it - Positive.
Didn’t  work out . Not quite what I expected ;Didn't work out - Negative.
Assembly Disaster. Many wooden dowels snapped while trying to put together, IKEA should provide extras. The instructions are poor, the direction of the boards is facing is important but there’s little to guide you until it’s too late. I basically made every misstep possible, ruined my evening and damaged some of the shelf. Wish they’d try a little harder with the instructions and provide extra dowels.;Many wooden dowels snapped - Negative, instructions are poor - Negative.
Ultimate utility. I've been using various Kallax combinations for years, including turning five-shelf giant into a kitchen pantry. I currently have five separate shelving units in my apartment to provide storage for all sorts of things. They're sturdy and spacious and easy to assemble. I can't imagine my home without them.;Sturdy - Positive, Spacious - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive, ultimate utility - Positive.
Love the self. I love the shelf but the accuracy of what is on the selves vs what is showing online has not been correct the last two times I drove all the way to the store so pick up the item I was looking for. We aware of this! It is quite annoying!; Love the shelf - Positive, accuracy - Negative.
Just what we needed. We've been looking for something nicer to store our cats' food and this fit every perfectly. We have a few other Ikea pieces so it worked in space. Really liked the mix of metal and wood. Also my husband didn't have too much trouble putting it together.;Perfect fit - Positive, nice quality - Positive, mix of metal and wood - Positive, husband found assembly OK - Neutral.
Don’t buy these!. Bought them almost 2yrs ago, just now getting around to putting them up! Yay quarantine!!! If you do the math it $22.50 per cube, 1/3 of them broke, or the backing was too tall or too wide, therefore not being able to fully assemble. Unless you want a janky looking cube with no back. Which we resorted to! For $22 a cube, you EXPECT better!;Broken cubes - Negative, $22.
Perfect size and good mix with Besta, Billy, Kallax. Variety is the spice of life. And also to a room layout.   A mix-up of Eket and Besta, using those series small- and medium-sized cabinets, has given life and spark to what would otherwise be a long, narrow, windowless, low (aka dark and boring) wall in our lounge/family/media room.   The scale of the two series is a perfect complement to the room’s dimensions. And building a rhythm of cabinet heights, all in a line, looks artful, but is still easily aligned to carrying our large flat screen.   Having Eket available for the room’s furnishing definitely makes the room pop.  In another room, a small office/projects room, five Eket, single- and double- doored cabinets, line the walls across from a low run of Kallax units. A short, narrow Billy, is popped in among the Ekets.   Three shallow, single-door Ekets have been stacked up (easy and safe to do with the Eket wall brackets. TY, Ikea!), in a corner just behind the room’s door. The stack works like a tall utility cabinet, without the tall utility cabinet aesthetic (love it).   Otherwise, on other wall two two-door Ekets do storage and display duty , one under a loved painting, the other under a window.   TY, IKEA, for adding the EKET series to your cabinets. Their scale and variety is a game changer.;Perfect size - Positive, good mix - Positive, variety - Positive, artful - Positive, easily aligned - Positive, perfect complement - Positive, scales well - Positive.

It's all right, but you have to install and handle with care. The door and the insert fit perfectly size-wise, however, the doors are hard to align perfectly. Additionally, the screws are so short that if you don't watch out you might pull the door out of its socket. Then, it's impossible to put it back.;Fits size-wise - Neutral, hard to align doors - Negative, doors prone to coming off - Negative, short screws - Negative.

Quietly classic, adjustable, and sturdy. We currently have the bookshelves in two places in our home—group of 4 lined up in a low attic space and another as a single bookshelves and display in an open-door closet—but we chose them for their versatility over time. In the future, I can see us using a shelf for holding records or as an entryway drop zone. They work great in a bank or as a single piece and the adjustable feet are a must for our old homes’ sloping floors.;Quietly classic - Positive, Adjustable - Positive, sturdy - Positive, versatile - Positive.
Spacious and elegant shelves. I love these shelves. Actually I bought four of them for my plant room! I had concern based on reviews I read that they may not be stable but I had no problem. I keep heavy terracotta pots on each one and they seem firm in place. They look very pretty and they can accommodate a lot of pots of things, but in the same time they don’t look too big.

Great Shelving. I bought this as an option for shelving and organization in my bathroom. It does come out about 10 inches, so need to plan appropriately for over the toilet (if that's where you are hanging it). The depth makes it great for towels and other items that you might place in containers.  It was really easy to assemble.  I also painted it to match with the decor in my bathroom. ;Great shelving - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, suitable for towels - Positive, appropriate depth - Positive, can be painted - Neutral.
Love it!. Bought 2 of the Havsta cabinets and 2 open shelves for my office/craft room. I can stash all my supplies in the cabinet and display my books, photos and other pretty things on the shelves.

Great sturdy wood for the price.;Love it - Positive, 2 Havsta cabinets - Positive, 2 open shelves - Positive, stash supplies - Positive, display items - Positive, deep cabinet - Positive.
Great design, slightly tricky assembly. I love the look and practicality of the unit. I deducted a star because assembly was a little tricky. The shelves do not have pre drilled holes and instead you have to use sharp screws provided to cut into the wood yourself, while also holding the wood in place even though it doesn't sit perfectly flush (you have to assess whether it is even on both sides). Eventually I got it well enough, but this could be improved.;Great design - Positive, Practicality - Positive, trimicky assembly - Neutral, no pre-drilled holes - Negative.

Good Product, one suggestion. I love the Kaplan system. I wish it came with covers for the screws/turn locks. Or at least a purchase option through IKEA. Stickers or plastic inserts. They’re such an eyesore and if I want them covered I have to track a solution down online and order hoping they fit;Love the Kaplan system - Positive, suggestion: covers for screws - Neutral.

"Doesn't come with connectors. I ordered this set as pictured- with the cubed shelf connected to the one tall one with the door. I knew this would need to be connected, but nowhere in the description or ""good to know"" section told me that I needed to order the connectors as well. I've purchased similar furniture from IKEA in the past and connectors were provided for those. Not sure why this one doesn't come with it. It's really inconvenient because I had all parts delivered, and now I'm missing the connectors and need to make a trip out.";Doesn't come with connectors - Neutral.

Top & bottom shelves are. Top & bottom shelves are a wood based material, and are supposed to be screwed onto the shelves. Unfortunately, I didn't have a drill and the material is super dense, so I wasn't able to use a punch to create a pilot hole for the screws.  The other issue I ran into, it was a me problem most likely, was that 2 of the posts have holes that need to be aligned with each other - but are otherwise identical. I missed this fact, despite reading the instructions before attempting assembly, and had to partially disassemble the unit to correct the mistake.  Nice aesthetic, overall.;Wood based shelves - Neutral, not able to assemble easily - Negative, nice aesthetic - Positive.

Assembly makes this piece not worth it. I bought this piece with expectations for assembly to be similar to the things I have bought from Ikea in the past - not the easiest but also not terrible if you have time and patience. However the assembly for this piece is honestly like torture. There really aren't any screws involved with this piece of furniture, just a lot of meeting the plastic ends in the holes and pushing them down to make it align. The pieces are not easy to align at all, I had to resort to a hammer which did the trick but damaged the piece of furniture itself so now I have a damaged piece of furniture, and good luck trying to get the last/final piece matched up and put together. Price is great and its not a bad piece but if I would have known what the assembly process would've been like before I purchased this I would not have bought it. Also, the door to my cabinet is unaligned due to bad pre-made holes and there's been nothing I can do to align it.;Assembly process - Negative, pieces not easy to align - Negative, unaligned door - Negative, damaged during assembly - Negative, pre-made holes - Neutermostly negative.
Great entry area cabinet. I'm using this in my back door entry for shoes and recycling. It looks great and holds a lot. Some of the pieces put up some resistance during assembly. I used a rubber mallet and very gentle taps to get them set. Not all parts needed that. If you decide to buy taller feet you'll need 8 total. I bought a 4 pack and had to order another. The cubes and the cabinet don't attach to each other so they need their own feet.;Great entry cabinet - Positive, holds a lot - Positive, looks great - Positive, assembly resistance - neutral, additional feet required - neutral.

looks beautiful. It added the chic minimalistic vibe I was going for. LOVE it.

Looks really nice. I bought two of these. I was able to put them together by myself in about 3 hours and that is with toddlers helping me. 😂 You need space to put them together.

Ehh….. Shelves are wonderful, but the assembly process was terrible. Instructions were too basic, no words to help. Half the time it shows holes for the wood and other times it doesn’t. The screws didn’t screw, the little things that connect the shelves didn’t work until you push as hard as you can (using 3 people).

Love . Please do not discontinue the FJALKINGE shelf unit with drawers!! This is one of my favorite ikea designs.  I love it’s simplicity and practicality, it works in either a living room or bedroom. I also like how there is flexibility in where you put the shelves and drawers (I install the drawers lower). This piece is tall and shallow so it gives you lots of storage without taking up much room.

Well made, very accurate. The shelves went together easily, even though I assembled it in an upright position, because I worked alone (oh, I broke a peg, but you thoughtfully included a spare).  The pieces were very accurate, and fit perfectly.

Ikea changes Expedit dimensions to meet new eco goals. As an owner of several Expedit shelving unit I thought those were marvelously cost efficient and sturdy units. I finally had to break down and buy the smaller Kallax units when the need for new storage arose. The Kallax is basically a slightly smaller exterior dimension version of the Expeditor with the same interior storage shelf dimensions. However, the new units feel distinctly less robust and the exterior finish cladding also seems a bit cheaper looking. I understand that Ikea will save considerable wood product given the enormous volume of Kallax that they sell worldwide, but I still lament the passing of the better quality Expedit.;Cost efficient - Positive, sturdy units - Positive, new units - Neutative, slightly smaller exterior - Neutral, cheaper looking finish - Negative, Ikea changes - Neutral.

perfect pantry storage!. I bought this shelving unit to use in my walk-in pantry and I bought the corresponding cabinets w/door, wine insert and the insert that makes one cubby into two. I put this together (not including the inserts I bought separately) in about 2 hours because I took my time. I would also use a rubber mallet if you have one. It makes it so much easier to tap in the wooden dowels which connects each section. It takes two people to lift it and it includes safety anchors that keep it from falling. The optional inserts give this shelving unit a customized look and I love the 15-inch depth which allows each cubby to hold more items than a regular bookshelf. I wish these IKEA reviews allowed for pictures to be posted but I couldn't see where that was an option. My pantry looks so organized and bright now!

Wonderful and versatile!!. We purchased two of these for our sunroom to hold our many many books haha! We not only have created an oasis of a library but a place for our plants to thrive on leaving enough space for a beanbag chair to get cozy to read! These are great because you don’t have to buy the frame to lay this on its side like we did. You can stand these upright and they would work great for storing things anywhere in the home. It could work in the kitchen for extra storage, could work in the dining room for holding China or commonly used items. It could also be a display place or put baskets in for hidden away functionality. It can be used I. The living room to give the illusion of an entertainment center if you put one on either side of your tv stand or used to put books in like we did :) sturdy, easy to take apart and re-assemble if you need to move it.

Just what I needed. This is a sturdy product with a small footprint. I was worried it would be wobbly since it has no stabilizing back, but it's great! It gave me plenty of extra storage space within and on top. I purchased fabric storage cubes that fit exactly in the openings and was even able to color-coordinate them with the room.;Small footprint - Positive, sturdy product - Positive, no wobbly - Positive, extra storage space - Positive.
Loved it. Easy to put together ;Easy to put together - Positive.
Truly terrible!!!. I generally don't have any complaint about putting together IKEA furniture and the 4x4 Kallax shelf I bought for this to go into was easy and straightforward to assemble. These inserts are a terror, however. It's basically just a scored piece of very thin MDF that you attach to the sides of the shelf with short screws. Except it is virtually impossible to get the screws to go all the way in, leaving the cabinet door lopsided. Just by the basket inserts and call it a day.;4x4 Kallax shelf - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, inserted pieces - Negative, MDF pieces - Negative, screwing in the screws - Negative, lopsided cabinet door - Negative.

Easy to assemble and gets kallax off the floor. These were super easy to assemble. I appreciate they came with additional hardware for the kallax if you're adding them to a unit you already have at home. If you're assembling both a kallax and the base on the same day, assemble the base first because you'll have to change the last step of your kallax unit build.;Easy to assemble - Positive, comes with additional hardware - Positive.

Horrible. There was half of a broken piece in the screws bag so I went to Ikea to get a new piece. Came back home and I see the other half of the broken piece in the furniture piece which was impossible to take out. Now I have to go back to ikea for a whole new furniture piece. Ikea is very unorganized.;Broken piece - Negative, screws bag - Neutral, unorganized - Negative, furniture piece - Negative.
Poor Materials. Kallax had poor materials and poor fit. Assembly relied on long, thin wooden rods to connect some of the shelves together, but rods that easily snap and often poorly fit together. Even the wooden rods that didn't snap left the the shelves very flimsy. Ikea really cheaped out here because screws or metal rods would have fixed these issues.;Poor materials - Negative, poor fit - Negative.

"Looks great and fits perfectly. I purchased 2 of these with the matching tv stand and they fit perfectly on my wall. Everything is solid wood, not often found with ""build yourself"" furniture. The color is closer to black than dark brown but I love it even more than I would have liked a brown. It looks amazing against the brick wall giving just the right balance in colors.

"hands down, the best money spent. I've had two of these now for about 5yrs now and I absolutely love them! They look so high-end. The glass shelves hold much more than I anticipated. I have a lot of books and some big, heavy, anthology-type books. I've had so many compliments on them. I do remember putting them together and it wasn't the worst experience. I did it by myself; just remember to not tighten everything until it's all assembled. They do seem a bit wobbly but with all the weight I have on them I don't think they'll tip. I did anchor them to the wall so that really helps.";High-end appearance - Positive, Glass shelves - Positive, Holds more than anticipated - Positive, Well-complemented - Positive, Anchored to wall - Positive, Wobbly but stable - Neutral.

Vittsjo white. Awesome product! Striking and beautiful in my home! Looks expensive! So far I really like it! Using for plants. I couldn’t find the directions so put it together myself as I could figure it out by the picture on the website. My husband had to put the screws into the wood for me. Didn’t take too long to put together. I laid out the pieces where they looked like they fit, double checked everything before putting it together. Price was good. Shipping cost was extremely high so drove 3.5 hours each way to pick up in person. There were no extra pieces at all so be extremely careful that none are lost. Bottom line is I really like it and how it looks. Hope it lasts a long time.;Awesome product - Positive, beautiful - Positive, expensive look - Positive, using for plants - Neutral, easy assembly - Positive, good price - Positive, high shipping cost - Neutral, well-built - Positive, durable - Positive.
Beautiful unit. I used these units to create a matching bed frame and side table. They're very sturdy and perfect for my needs.;Beautiful unit - Positive, sturdy - Positive, matching bed frame - Neutral, perfect for needs - Positive.
Nice bookcase-lots of cardboard & packing. I would rate the book case as very nice, typical Ikea. Assembly was the usual Ikea pita, but all parts fit with no problems. Took me a couple of hours - it's much easier with better tools like a ratchet or power screwdriver.  This is packaged in two boxes (one very long - the height of the unit.). The two generated a large, maybe shocking amount of cardboard waste. In addition to the boxes there is quite a bit of internal packing material. Yeah... all recyclable, but after cutting it up to small pieces and collapsing the packing it still took almost half of my weekly recycling bin.  There must be a better way, but I don't know what it is. So down one star for the mess made.;Nice bookcase - Positive, typical Ikea - Neutral, assembly process - Neutral, recyclable packaging - Neutral, large amount of waste - Negative.
There was a dent on the side.. The dent is next to the wall so we didn’t return it.;Dent on product - Negative, next to the wall - Neutural.

Hard to install. Kallax inserts are hard to install without a drill or electric screw driver. They look great once installed.;Hard to install - Negative, look great - Positive.
Poorly Designed. IKEA usually makes great products, but this is a rare miss.  There are no pre-drilled holes for the door hinges on the furniture, so you have to measure and mark the location yourself. Also, the opening for the screws to secure the hinges is oblong, so you can adjust the height slightly. This leaves significant room for error both vertically and horizontally. If the inner hinges aren't perfectly lined up with the piece attached to the door, the door will never lie flush. Also, the pressed board shelving unit doesn't hold the screws in place, so they can pop out easily.  I recommend skipping these doors and opting for bins. I can't speak for the drawers, but they probably suffer from the same lack of specificity.;Poorly designed - Negative, no pre-drilled holes - Negative, oblong opening - Negative, significant room for error - Negative, pressed board shelving unit - Negative.
Took work to install.. While the doors are good, installing them was rough. The Kallax units do not have areas for the door hinge, so you have to make your own. This made things a bit difficult.;Kallax units - Neutral, rough installation - Negative, no hinge areas - Negative.
Lasts 2 days. I built the shelf and put the insert doors in on Sunday. It is now Tuesday and, within those two days, 3 of the 8 doors have completely ripped off leaving huge holes. It is basically hard cardboard inserts with tiny screws that don't hold a heavy door. Very disappointing!;Lasts 2 days - Negative, rip off doors - Negative, lightweight inserts - Negative.
Hard to install with equipment listed. Kallax inserts are hard to install without a drill or electric screw driver. Looks great once installed.;Looks great - Positive, difficult installation - Negative, requires drill or electric screwdriver - Neutral.
It's all right, but you have to install and handle with care. The door and the insert fit perfectly size-wise, however, the doors are hard to align perfectly. Additionally, the screws are so short that if you don't watch out you might pull the door out of its socket. Then, it's impossible to put it back.;Perfect size fit - Neutral, hard to align doors - Negative, short screws - Negative.
NOT HAPPY - Must Put Holes in Your Unit to Use. These need to be screwed into your actual bookcase which will put holes in it. I think IKEA should make this clear in their description. I would not have bought these if I known they had to be screwed in. WHY did they change these to this cheap option.;Needs to be screwed in - Negative, cheap option - Negative.
"Old inserts were good- These are TERRIBLE. I sent my husband to the store to pick up 5 of these after an online order did not arrive when it was supposed to. I wish I had seen them first. Ikea totally cheaped out on these! They are flimsy cardboard, very cheaply made but sold at a price that commands better quality. I would not pay more than $12 for this product. Where the cardboard bends back to overlap (providing ""strength"" at the attachment point), the paper splits. The insert frame does not sit completely flush in the cube. The hardware doesn't sit perfectly in the bore AND the hinge is not adjustable, so you can't hang these so that the door closes flush either. You have to damage the Kallax unit to use any inserts now, so when you realize these are crap and remove them for return, you are left with holes and scrape marks. And just a heads up: prepare for the most annoying returns process anywhere. Cancelling an online order and returning what I already have here. This stuff is a headache.";Flimsy cardboard - Negative, cheaply made - Negative, not priced appropriately - Negative, insert frames don't sit flush - Negative, hardware doesn't sit perfectly - Negative, hinge not adjustable - Negative.

A great value for the price!!;Easy to put together - Positive, sturdy - Positive, unique accessories - Positive, great value - Positive.
Nice bookshelf with optional storage. I have to admit I was inspired by a few of the desk setup videos on YouTube that featured this shelf and drawer combination. Aesthetically, the shelves and two drawers look very nice. In actual use I found the drawers themselves to be more shallow than expected and do not pull out as far as I would like. My IKEA store didn't have an example on the showroom floor so I bought without actually seeing it fully assembled in real life. I still like the overall functionality of the shelves and drawers but it's just the difference between expectations and reality.;Optional storage - Positive, nice look - Positive, shallow drawers - Neutral, do not pull out far - Neutral, difference between expectations and reality - Neutral.
Good value and good quality. Assembling the Kallax is very simple and easy.  The instruction is clear and easy to follow.  I'd recommend buying it;Good value - Positive, good quality - Positive, simple assembly - Positive, clear instructions - Positive.
KALLAX shelf UNIT. Kallax Shelf Unit is suitable for any family home. We got 4*3 racks and everything is perfect. But I want to bring notice to the IKEA team, it needs more elaborate description for manual, which created some confusion while assembling.  ;Suitable for family homes - Positive, perfect purchase - Positive, confusing assembly instructions - Negative.
Perfect album storage. This unit is the perfect storage option for record albums. My husband was able to organize his rather large collection and is so pleased with the result. Assembly was straight forward and the finished unit looks great and is very sturdy.;Perfect album storage - Positive, Straightforward assembly - Neutral, looks great - Positive, sturdy - Positive.
Easy to assemble--but a bit tricky to finish. A great asset for storing larger items. But, be sure to follow instructions--when you get to that last piece. you'll be glad you did!;Easy to assemble - Positive, stores larger items - Positive, following instructions - Positive.
Follow directions carefully to avoid common problem.. I have bought several of these and it was very easy to assemble. If it didn’t slide together, I just used a mallet and it went together just fine. * I have seen several reviews that said they had trouble putting the last piece in place because the back panel was too long. I ran into this problem too and realized that it was because I hadn’t followed the directions correctly. It is easy to miss but the first side you start with is supposed to have a 1 on it. It is easy to miss! It is really important however, because the side with a 1 on it has a deeper groove so the back piece can slide down so you can slide the last piece in. I was able to slide the pieces apart so I could redo it and it worked just like it’s supposed.;Easy assembly - Positive, careful directions - Positive, deep groove - Neutral.
Looks great, but impossible to put together.. On some of my small square pieces, the pegs/dowels got stuck and broke before inserting another board. After IKEA sent two new boards and pegs when the unit was completed. The last screw kept turning and turning, it would not enter the final board. Now my kallax is in pieces and the dowels/pegs are of course stuck in the boards. It was quite difficult to build a 3x4 unit. It would be nice to pay extra and have it assembled at the store, but no taskrabbit for me, fore I live one hour away. The entire unit will be returned. I am very disappointed in the product.;Looks great - Positive, impossible to assemble - Negative, broken pegs - Negative.

I do wish it had a few more screws in the center to stabilize it further but mostly it's just wooden pegs in the center parts. So it's not the most sturdy thing ever. I do wish they had a dark brown option but I may stain it.;Easy to build - Positive, wooden pegs - Neutral, semi-sturdy - Neutral.
KALLAX Cubicle Storage. Very well made and will be very useful for my sewing storage.;Well made - Positive, useful for sewing storage - Positive.
Easy to assemble and just. Easy to assemble and just what a needed for the space in my bedroom.;Easy to assemble - Positive, just needed - Positive.
Stack Up. Once it's all assembled, the shelf unit looks good and appears sturdy. However, assembly is somewhat tiresome and at the end more work than expected. When looking at the unit standing vertically, the horizontal shelves require hammering with a hammer and board to protect the thick side panels. The worse part is the last vertical divider has to be shaved between 1/32 and 1/16 of an inch in order to have the thick top panel lay flat across the side panels and not rock on the center divider. Once I figured this out, the final assembly was fine. I believe it is a result of the tolerance stack-up of the horizontal shelf thickness and overall height of the vertical members will always result in a dimension slightly larger than the side panel heights.;Looks good when assembled - Positive, appears sturdy - Positive, tiresome assembly - Neutral, requires hammering - Neutral, last vertical divider adjustment - Negative.

Great shelf. Sturdy and easy to assemble.;Sturdy - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive.
Versatile, but . . .. Kallax is versatile, and it has a clean aesthetic appeal, but it's far from robust, so we'll have to see how it wears. The doors and related cube enclosures are not easy to install using Ikea instructions, particularly getting the hinges to sit properly.;Versatile - Positive, clean aesthetic - Positive, not robust - Neutral, difficult installation - Negative.
Better instructions for assembling. The instructions are difficult to follow because didn’t indicate what littler parts use and every single hole.;Difficult instructions - Negative.
Hard to assemble. The screws were not set properly. It was hard to make use of the screw and connect joints. So it was shaky and felt flimsy.;Hard to assemble - Negative, screws not properly set - Negative, shaky - Negative, felt flimsy - Negative

Got what I wanted and planned for.. Same as above;Got what I wanted - Positive, planned for - Positive.
Frustrating to put together but looks great. Oh man, for such a tiny item, it was very frustrating to put together. I'd rather put together 10 of the stands these go into than ever do this again. You will have to screw into the stand to get this to fit right. So make sure you are 100 percent sure where you want this to go. Once you have put this together it looks awesome and the drawers are perfect. I use mine as a make up drawer as I use my table as a get ready staging area. It works for what I need it to.;Frustrating to assemble - Negative, looks great - Positive, perfect drawers - Positive.
Good but..... It is geed and works well but it could hold more with a little change. The walls of the drawer itself could be taller making it ever more useful.;Good - Positive, works well - Positive, could hold more - Neutral, taller drawer walls - Neutral.
Great add on. The concept of being able to add it later, for drawers is really great. Feel like the look of them isn’t as clean as some drawers look a little crooked.;Ability to add later - Positive, great add on - Positive, look of drawers - Neutral.
Nice customization for the Kallax cubes. Love that the drawers slide very easily, and close with a light tap. Only improvement I would like is for drawer sides to be higher.;Customization for Kallax cubes - Positive, ease of use of drawers - Positive, light tap closure - Positive, drawer sides height - Negative.
Nice Shelving Unit. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this went together. Took my husband about 40 minutes to assemble one unit. No issues so far. Using it for my craft room and once things are organized, I think it will work well.;Nice shelving unit - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, took 40 minutes - Neutral, not issued so far - Positive.
EKET 4 cubby cabinet. Very nice quality. went together easily ( I followed instructions). My only wish is that the base with legs had been available- I would have liked that look, but the single wood legs I got do look good with the white cabinet;Nice quality - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, base with legs unavailable - Neutral.
UGH!. The only IKEA is nearly forty minutes from me. I bought this item and decided to put it together today. What should’ve taken about ten minutes to assemble with minimal effort ended up taking nearly an hour and an unnecessary amount of work. All because the two side panels are reverse threaded on every side. When tightening the screws, the screws go perfectly into the top and bottom and repel the two inserts. It makes putting the two pieces together nearly impossible. Unfortunately I’m too busy working and gas is too expensive to return this item, especially since there’s no guarantee whichever piece I purchase won’t be the same or worse. Very inconvenient.;Reverse threaded side panels - Negative.
Good and reasonable price. Easy to install and lightweight;Reasonable price - Positive, Easy to install - Positive, Lightweight - Positive.
Perfect for my pantry. Very sturdy. A little tricky to put together, so I suggest an extra pair of hands;Perfect for pantry - Positive, very sturdy - Positive, tricky assembly - Neutral.
Album Shelves. I Love These Shelves;Love these shelves - Positive, album shelves - Neutral.
Excellent all-pupose shelves. These shelves are deeper than normal bookshelves, so great for storing stuff. Easy to assemble. I added 2 drawer units and 2 cupboard doors - also easy. They look really nice.;Deep shelves - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, look nice - Positive.
Nice Unit. Nice bookcase. I like that the top and bottom shelves are wood and only the center is glass - no need for me to worry about the cats if they decide to jump up on it. Fairly easy assembly once I found a video. This will probably end up in my home office. However, I took off a star because the wood shelves were not predrilled and it was extremely difficult to get the bottom shelf on. You will need a drill or electric screwdriver with drill bit to drill the holes for the screws.;Wooden top and bottom shelves - Positive, glass center - Neutral, fairly easy assembly - Positive, wood shelves not predrilled - Negative.
Toughest Ikea build I've ever done!. This review is for placing two pieces next to each other. I put together two Baggegos, then I took them apart, then I put them together again. I've put together five Hyllis and know that lightweight metal shelving can be very forgiving yet not at all forgiving. Adjusting two Baggegos next to each other for over an hour, they varied in angles that were half an inch off. which might've been ok for one piece, but when next to each other, no. I had to duct tape them together tightly to get them to properly align while adjusting. My knuckles were red from the mesh metal so I went in our toolbox to find a ratcheting phillips head screwdriver. You need a phillips with a fatter head and a skinnier handle, or better, a ratcheting handle. And you might need some duct tape or zip ties. One positive thing is that the screws are sturdy, the threads survived many adjustments. All that said, Baggebo is nice for us plant people because it lets light through the mesh surfaces, and it's fairly priced.;Toughest Ikea build - Negative, placing two pieces next to each other - Negative, lightweight metal shelving - Neutral, sturdy screws - Positive, lets light through mesh surfaces - Positive, fairly priced - Neutrial.
Poorly made. This is a very poorly made shelving unit. It’s held together with little wood pegs that make it very shaky. When trying to move it into a room without much room to maneuver I had to tip it up on it’s side a bit. That shift of weight broke all the wood pegs and collapsed the whole thing down on itself. So now I’m out the price of the unit and a trip to the dump.;Poorly made - Negative, shaky - Negative, little wood pegs - Negative.
Perfect. Just what we needed to give us the storage we needed.;"Storage solution - Positive

Plastic was not white. I received this to put in my alternative kallax but I opened it up to find the rims of the shelf were covered with PE-LD 04 black labels that I could NOT get off. defeated the slim look. never got to put it together and now have to return it at the store. :(;Plastic not white - Neutive, PE-LD 04 black labels - Negative, could not get off - Negative.
Perfect Record Storage. For storing my record collection these are perfect;Record storage - Positive.

Sturdy. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.;Easy to assemble - Positive, sturdy - Positive.
Good shelf just a little pricey. I've got these shelf in a couple of different configuration and this one is the smallest of them all. I needed the shelf for a small area and thats why I didn't get the bigger one. For the price I think this is a little expensive when you compare to the little larger one (2x2) for example. If you need the shelf for a specific space like I did and want to keep the style than you have no choice. Overall good quality that you would expect from Ikea;Small shelf - Neutral, good quality - Positive, expensive - Negative.
Do not buy. I don't know why there are such great reviews. I opened the product and automatically wanted to return. First, all of the wood panels need extra coats of paint. I'm not sure how to say it correctly, but you can see the wood holes/marks which some might like, but there are blue streaks on every single panel. There are also dents and markings to a lot of the pieces. I would not recommend this product.;Wood panels need extra coats of paint - neutral, blue streaks on every panel - Negative, dents and markings - Negative.
A wonderful item for storing games. I have watched many game reviewers as they sit in front of KALLAX units filled with games. I finally decided to try this out -- and I am so glad I did! This is the perfect game storage solution. I love these things.;Game storage solution - Positive, perfect for games - Positive, love these things - Positive.
Time for BETTER directions an BETTER connecttions. I own MANY KALLAX units. My first large purchase 9 months ago was assembled by a friend. I recently assembled a second purchase myself.   I bought many items from IKEA back in the early 1990s, shortly after they opened in Philly. I now live in an IKEA-free zone. I can't believe that the hardware, during the intervening years, has become cheesier, and the assembly directions remain vague in every language. The reason for the first is obvious: profit. The second is unconscionable: laziness.   I had to reassemble this unit just as I was about to begin the unpleasant task of wall mounting it when I realized one side was in the opposite direction. The directions sheets LOOK as if they were printed in the 1990s as they are so faded. I had to look VERY carefully to comprehend my mistake -- FINALLY seeing two tiny dots on at the end of each panel that must align for mounting. Add an arrow noting they must align!!!  The wall mounting is another sad story.;IKEA units - Neutral, hardware quality - Negative, assembly directions - Negative.
Kallax in glossy white. I picked up two 2 by 4 Kallax shelves. The first was a bit difficult to put together, but by modifying instructions became much easier. The second came with one of the short shelf pieces missing its gloss paint so that the shelf only goes along the wall until I paint over the raw edge. Both shelves gained small chips and indentations as they were put together, nothing major, but a bit of a bummer as they were brand new. If they were easier to put together and came in perfect condition, they’d be great. Still love the look of the white gloss and they will work for now.;Glossy white finish - Positive, two by four shelving units - Neutral, some assembly difficulty - Negative, chipped and indented - Neutral, missing gloss paint - Negative.
Awesome piece of furniture!. Easy to assemble and sturdy. You can find multiple uses for this. Stand it up or lay on it’s side.;Easy to assemble - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, multiple uses - Neutral.
Crafter’s heaven. Great addition to the bookshelves. It hides lots of my paper crafting supplies which I put in little plastic bins and tuck inside the drawers. Keeps the space looking clean and organized.;Great addition - Positive, hides supplies - Positive, looks clean - Positive, well organized - Positive.
I can’t drill holes into my space. Apparently, these need to be permanently affixed via screws into plaster to be safe. NO THANKS AS THAT IS NOT A VIABLE OPTION!;Can't drill holes - Neutral, permanently affixed - Negative.
great product. I have bought several kallax shelving units over the years. Great quality control and easy to set up.;Great product - Positive, Great quality control - Positive, Easy to set up - Positive.
Drawers for kallax cube. Easy to assemble, but drawers could be taller. Only 2.5 inches tall.;Easy to assemble - Positive, Drawers could be taller - Negative, tallness - Negative.
disappointed. I thought these were great and just what I needed and bought several -- only to find that you can only use them on open kallax cubes. you cant use them on cubes where you have doors. So disappointing that Ikea limits you on how you can use them.;Disappointed - Negative, great - Neutorial, bought several - Neutral, limited - Negative, can't use on cubes with doors - Negative.
Does its job. Doesn’t exactly bolt on securely;Does its job - Neutral, doesn't bolt on securely - Negative.
Shelving system for organizing. Bought two shelves and set up horizontally to use with bins that keep my space organized. Looks great across the wall!;Organizing shelving system - Positive, looks great - Positive.
Elevates the Kallax units. I bought this separately from my Kallax unit because I wasn’t for sure I wanted to use them. But, I should have know how well they would be made coming from Ikea. I got the black for my light wood color Kallax unit. The color contrast is perfect and I can vacuum under it too. I am so happy with my Kallax. I bought 2 units and the feet and the Drona blue inserts. I get so many compliments on this in my scrapbook room. I highly recommend the feet for the perfect combination.;Elevates Kallax units - Positive, well-made - Positive, black color contrast - Positive.
This base is a must have.. I did not want my Kallax unit to sit directly on the floor. This base brings it high enough to sweep under it.;Must-have base - Positive, brings unit off floor - Positive.
Perfect Storage. What else can you say about the perfect storage solution? I bought 2 sets and turned one vertical and one horizontal. I am happy that I bought the feet for them separately. I wanted to make sure I liked them first, so I bought the feet separately in case I wanted to take them back. I got the light brown color and the darker blue inserts. Best storage for my scrapbook room. The 12x12 paper fits perfectly!;Perfect storage solution - Positive, 12x12 paper fits perfectly - Positive, bought feet separately - Neutral, light brown color - Neutral, darker blue inserts - Neutral.
Kallax Bookshelf. Perfect shelf for my craft room. Now I want some drawers and doors to complete the look.;Perfect shelf - Positive, craft room - neutral.
Just right. Great price, right size, low profile makes the books the focus which is the best, holds more than you'd expect;Great price - Positive, Right size - Positive, Low profile - Positive, Holds more than expected - Positive.
Don't buy- you will regret!. We bought two, and 100% disappointed!! Don't buy unless you want to frustrate yourself out!!! We built the first one right after it arrived. Half way through, a major piece, the hole is miss punch! The second one arrived the next day. Until the last step, we noticed the metal part wasn't rectangle!! It was tilted!!  Now, we have two incomplete shelves standing side by side! They don't line up together on even surface!  WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK!!!!! PLEASE RECALL THIS!!! I just read the reviews, and many people have the same situation!! I wished I read the review before purchased this! Can't believe I even paid for shipping to get this over! PLEASE REFUND US!!!!! Ikea, I hope you are reading these reviews! I hope you can refund us and send someone to pick up the furniture! Thanks!;Disappointed - Negative, major piece miss punch - Negative, metal part not rectangle - Negative, incomplete shelves - Negative, refuse refund - Negative.
Piece in box was wrong - FRUSTRATED. I purchased this last week, deciphered the instruction book and got half way through and noticed that the large piece which is essentially the left frame didn't match the picture. It looked almost like the right side, but it wasn't a duplicate either. IKEA won't send a new piece, so I get to either hike back another hour and exchange or return. Poor product, poor customer service.;Wrong piece - Negative, frustration - Negative, no replacement from IKEA - Negative.
Avoid Like the Plague!. Similar to many other reviews on the FJALLBO, I wish I never left the store with this shelf. Not only did it take a few hours to piece together but multiple parts were defective, including the main frame structure: holes drilled without threads, missing foot piece and no holes or screws to attach to a wall. It's safe to say this unit is a real piece of junk. Worst of all, after speaking with IKEA's USA help team (Twitter) they advised that I either disassemble it and bring it in for an exchange or try and fit the entire unit in my trunk so I can waste even more time dealing with this garbage and building a new one. Hmm, I wonder if the second one will have issues...;Defective parts - Negative, multiple hours assembly - Negative, real piece of junk - Negative.
Why!. I was obsessed with this shelf, but it is HORRIBLE to put together !!!!!! Please do not buy it!!! The parts are all WRONG and it is fustrasting !!! I am so annoyed ! I have been working this shelf for the last 4hrs ! Easy to assemble but the part are off, and the screws are wrong. Warning do not buy!!!!! I love IKEA, but this was a bad choice!;Obsessed with shelf - Positive, horrible to put together - Negative, parts are wrong - Negative, frustrating assembly - Negative.
Cheap material + damaged in box. I ordered two sets of these drawer inserts and they both arrived damaged! The sides of these inserts are a flexible cardboard material (instead of wood). They arrive flat and are designed to bend along seams in the 4 corners to form a box shape. Both arrived with a seam already ripped/detached, so I cannot assemble them without taping them back together. I am returning them!;Flexible cardboard material - Negative, arrived damaged - Negative.
Drawers don’t use space well.. I bought these for our playroom to help organize all the small toys. Bought these to put all the little figures and the side walls are HALF the size of the front. It’s a total waste of space and they hardly hold anything. Just put a basket in, don’t waste your money on these.;Drawers don't use space well - Negative.
Cute wall Cube. This cube is the perfect size and weight. It looks great on my wall. My biggest complaint is the assembly. I have bought several ikea items which usually don’t have the easiest directions. But this was Horrible. All 4 sides went on easy, but to get the back on took a mallet and lots of patience. I watched several YouTube videos to guide me , unfortunately, the assembly of 5 cubes took days. I had to walk away so my frustration did not lead to damaging the unit.;Perfect size - Positive, ideal weight - Positive, great on wall - Positive, complex assembly - Negative.
Very attractive and functional. I like the furniture even better after I received a price adjustment since it went on sale right after we bought it. We added crown molding to the top of each bookcase, was just what they needed. Also added a shelf between the bookcases over the base cabinet, just tied everything together nicely. Love it!;Attractive - Positive, functional - Positive, price adjustment - Positive, added crown molding - Positive, added shelf - Positive.
Beautiful color. Kallax as always, quite utilitarian. But this color my new buy, looks stunning with the baskets shown. Also got other natural baskets/bins. My kitchen/dining has a farmhouse feel in my 1BR apartment. When fixing the smaller panel, doing alone with arthritic hands, had to use rubber/mallet lightly. Even for my fragile hands, left a cookie-crumble crack. They are quite flimsy. However, since this has underframe, I used the felt pads like a honeycomb design to cover the crack. It is best to take a helping hand. This being long top panel, thankfully I did not break the wood plugs. Ikea, pl provide some extra wood plugs for any Kallax . Thanks.;Beautiful color - Positive, utilitarian - Neutral, fragile - Negative, best with help - Neutral, flimsy - Negative, has underframe - Positive, thanks for extra wood plugs suggestion - Neutral.
I like this design. Sturdy looking, I like it. I wish there was more modularity options in height and width. Width is only available in 1 block, 2 or 4. Why not three?;Sturdy looking - Positive, modularity options - negative, available in widths of 1, 2, or 4 units - Neutral.
Perfect. I was looking for a good way to organize my caft papers and this unit is perfect! Love it!;Organizes papers well - Positive, love it - Positive.
Useful.. Help to organizing.;Useful - Positive.
IKEA. It’s a big world, someone has to furnished it :);IKEA - Neutral (this sentence expresses a general statement rather than a sentiment about a specific product)
Small space solution. Needed a small free standing shelf unit that could fit by the washing machine that someone in a wheelchair could use to keep cleaning supplies and detergent in reach to be able to do their own laundry and regain some independence after a near fatal motorcycle accident.;Small space solution - Positive, free standing shelf unit - Neutral, fits by washing machine - Positive, able to keep cleaning supplies in reach - Positive, regain independence - Positive.
Not so fast, not so easy. I agree with some of the previous buyers and wish I had seen them sooner. It was difficult to get my hand and screwdriver in the corners for the upper screws. The holes themselves are weird and it took me multiple times to get them in in general. I'm grateful I didn't buy two like I originally intended. I'm keeping it but won't be purchasing again.;Difficult assembly - Negative.
Poor quality. I’m leaving an honest review. This product is very difficult to assemble. You need extremely small hands. The metal used is cheap and bends easily. Overall this is my least favorite ikea product. I do not recommend. It explains why it’s on sale.;Difficult to assemble - Negative, poor quality - Negative, cheap metal - Negative.
Nice quality but the shelves.... I love this show! It fits perfectly in the space, however, the screws to install the shelves are extremely difficult to reach based on their location and the small size of the screws. I had to finger tighten them for the most part because I could not get a screwdriver in the small shallow space.;Nice quality - Positive, Difficult shelf installation - Negative.
no more clutter. This is so diverse and doesn't take up much floor space. I had some narrow space at the foot of my bed and this fit perfectly. The shelves and drawers are adjustable. My Yoga mat and wrapping paper fit in the drawer and hand weights and the modem in a wood box I bought from Target..I bought 3 of these and they fit perfectly on the bottom shelf: Wood Milk Crate Large by Pillowfort. I only put heavy things on the very bottom and light stuff above. You have to attach it to the wall or it could tip easily! Don't put heavy objects in the drawers.;No clutter - Positive, diverse design - Positive, adjustable shelves and drawers - Positive, fits narrow spaces - Positive, easy assembly - Neutral, securely attach to wall - Positive.
office storage. This works well in my office space. I bought 2 and stacked them.;Office storage - Neutral, works well - Positive, stacked 2 units - Neutral.
Great Ravaror bookself. This item is neat and nicely crafted. It was easy to assemble, except for the holes marked for attaching the caster assembly. They had the punch mark, but lacked any pre-drilling, which made it impossible to get the screws to go into the product. Has to make starting pre-drilled holes enough to get the screw to attach properly.  I love the fact it is raised off the floor and easily moved when needed.;Neatly crafted - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, raised off floor - Positive, movable - Positive, challenging caster assembly - Negative.

Perfection. I waited MONTHS for Vittsjo to come back in stock, and I am so glad I didn't give up and purchase something elsewhere. To get a similar look elsewhere will cost ~$300. This shelf unit is GORGEOUS – modern, clean lines, simple, well-constructed, sturdy. I do wish the holes in the top and bottom wood slabs were pre-drilled, but it wasn't too difficult to do it ourselves. We also didn't receive enough padding stickers for the glass, so we improvised. I can't say enough good things about this unit otherwise.;Modern look - Positive, clean lines - Positive, simple design - Positive, well-constructed - Positive, sturdy - Positive, long wait for stock - Neutral.

Addition of the doors makes it a tidy look.;Perfect for studio - Positive, comes in many sizes - Positive, organizess craft supplies - Neutral, adds doors - Positive.
Icing my Forearms. A great little 5 star shelf if someone else puts it together for you. I really wanted to believe the “so easy” reviews and not the “nothing can reach the screw holes” reviews. But alas. I also didn’t expect to spend 30 minutes removing the stickers. Then another 50 or 60 minutes to assemble, between everything sliding around, the 36 short little screws with nothing to grab onto to get them started, frequently dropping the screws and having to fish them out of the groove on the shelf, each screw taking all my weight and effort to coax it along every quarter turn, and all (16) of the top screws being about a millimeter away from the metal grate your knuckles will repeatedly scrape over in the process. I am a seasoned IKEA assembler and this one almost defeated me. I was sweating and hands shaking. I turned so hard the screwdriver bit got stuck in the handle. Agree with reviewer who said wait to tighten the screws at the end. Olive oil helps with the stickers.

Always a great deal. Kallax units are great storage units in all sizes! We use them in my sewing room, where I have the 5x5, 4x4 and 2x2 units, as well as our garage (where my husband customized some individual units). They are versatile and the doors and inserts allow us to tailor the Kallax to our specific needs.;Great deals - Positive, versatile storage units - Positive, doors and inserts - Positive, tailored to specific needs - Positive.
Wonderful sturdy shelf organizer with flaws. I love how sturdy this piece is and that I can get organized now. It has very clear instructions to put it together. I have owned quite a few IKEA pieces of furniture like this one. The have all been great for a good price and well made. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the “faux wood” stuff that covers the compressed wood underneath. We always use a rubber mallet to hammer in the dowels and hammer the ends of the boards to get them to go in place. This unit had the “faux wood” stuff peeling up very easily and in multiple places. I have never had that happen…ever before. I can only assume that IKEA is using cheaper materials or something which is very disappointing and doesn’t make for the prettiest final product.;Sturdy shelf organizer - Positive, clear instructions - Positive, well-made - Positive, disappointing faux wood quality - Negative.
Questionable Quality. Bought these to match one that I’ve had for 5 years. The quality has obviously lessened in the last few years, as these newer ones are more prone to cracking and flaking. Be very careful putting them together. Use soap to help the dowels go in - 80% of the holes were just enough too small that I needed a mallet to put the piece on. Not just a little tap with a hammer. And use a block of wood between the hammer and the shelf. Make the holes a tiny bit bigger!;Questionable quality - Negative, smaller holes - Negative.
Dresses up your Kallax. These doors really improved the look of our Kallax. Took off 1 star cuz I had a little trouble getting the doors to fit perfectly straight.;Improved look - Positive, doors - Neutral, fits perfectly - Negative.
Love it!. I made this desk in 45 min. It was extremely easy to build with the instructions. Just make sure you don’t miss a step! And I was able to do it all by myself. Had it built before my husband got home 🤣 and I loved the packaging, it was minimal but efficient. So we didn’t have boxes for days!;Easy to build - Positive, instructions clear - Positive, minimal packaging - Positive, self-assembly - Positive.
Storage Unit. Very sturdy and looks great in the room. I am using it for craft storage so I also purchased some of the drona inserts.;Very sturdy - Positive, looks great - Positive.

Kallax. I love this so much! It takes the kallax off of the floor and elates its status from storage to furniture! The black gives it a modern vibe!;Kallax - Positive, modern vibe - Positive, elates status - Positive.
Perfect for dorm room. We bought this to maximize storage in my daughter’s dorm room closet. The optional drawer and basket inserts made this perfect for her needs - some sections for folded clothes, some nicely holding smaller items in drawers. Thanks IKEA!;Maximizes storage - Positive, ideal for dorm room - Positive, perfect for needs - Positive, optional drawer and baskets - Positive.
Kallax divide. This piece is designed to really fit the Kallax cubes. It won't shift or move once it's in the cubes. You do have to line it up exactly so that it will fit.;Fits Kallax cubes - Positive, Won't shift or move - Positive, Requires alignment to fit - Neutral.
Good when they fit. Some of the dividers didn't fit into the cubes. It seemed like they were just a tad too big. And the cubes we have are this brand from IKEA.;Some dividers didn't fit - Negative, cubes are from IKEA - Neutral.
Great storage option for your Kallax shelf, tho a little fragile. I bought this along with other Kallax storage boxes as a place to keep rolls of paper and interfacing that I use for sewing. It looks great. It works great. My only issue is that I ordered it to be delivered and when it arrived (through the mail), one corner had been slightly dinged up. Not a huge deal since I was able to turn the messed up corner to the back and it's not really visible, but this needs better packing when being shipped. A great option if you can pick it up in store, but a little bit of a gamble if it's shipped to you.;Great storage option - Positive, looks great - Positive, slightly fragile - Neutter, needs better packing - Negative.
Nice, but need darker color. I have a black-brown Kallax, and would have liked this insert to match. Since only white was available, I bought it and spray painted it black. It was a little more difficult to fit with the thickness of the paint, but works overall.;Nice insert - Positive, black-brown Kallax - Neutral, needed darker color - Negative, difficulty fitting with spray paint - Neutral.
Great item. I brought one several years ago in a Grey color. By the time I got back to IKEA you had discontinued them. I was excited to see them back. This time they are a thinner and only in white. How about a black/brown color to match my unit.;Great item - Positive, brought several years ago - Neutral, discontinued - Negative, available in white - Neutral, request for black/brown color - Neutral.

Wonderful piece. I've had this shelving unit in two going on three apartments now. I've used it as an open dresser for clothes in my bedroom, and soon it will be a TV stand in a living room. The clean lines of the design blend in and brighten any room. Even though the drawer mechanism requires a little patience to build, they close cleanly in keeping with this price point or a higher one. I would definitely recommend it. I'm grateful it's so easy to switch out the shelf configuration. As someone mentioned in another review, it's very important to anchor this unit because it's quite tall. Even though it's sturdy you want to make sure to have insurance against weight being distributed in the wrong way. Overall a great-looking, functional piece that would cost much much more if CB2 or West Elm had come up with it.;Blends in and brightens rooms - Positive, high-quality drawers - Positive, functional - Positive, easy to switch shelf configuration - Positive, great-looking - Positive.
Kallax cube units are awesome. I am redoing my craftroom with Kallax cubes and I absolutely love the look and the quality of them.

Received Defective unit. One of the protruding brackets that lines up for the rectangular pipe that holds the wooden shelf are soldered on tilted at an angle, so that means I cannot align the rectangular pipe to properly hold the shelf. Still attempting to contact customer service, and ikea has probably the worst customer service I have encountered, not looking forward to this. Lazy quality control.;Defective unit - Negative, tilted bracket - Negative, customer service - Negative, quality control - Negative.
Love This Option!. The baskets for the KALLAX system are fantastic! I use one of my KALLAX to store purses and the basket works to store wallets and clutches with the purses. This accessory makes the cubes so much more functional and they’re already functional! Love this!;Love This Option! - Positive, fantastic baskets - Positive, makes KALLAX functional - Positive.
Must have baskets for cube storage. These baskets are PERFECT for dividing items in cube storage. The genius design of a clip at the back of the basket, around the shelf, makes it stay in place and not sag, while allowing the use of economical, lightweight material.;Perfect for cube storage - Positive, genius design - Positive, stays in place - Positive.
Great basket. It clips in and locks tight. I use an old expedit wall unit as a headboard, and this basket just made it that much more wonderful. My 15” MacBook Pro fits in quite nicely in it so I have room to put a glass of water and my phone and pills without worrying about any spills. It really increases the amount of space I have reachable from bed, since nothing I keep nearby is tall enough to take up the whole height of a cubby.;Clips in and locks tight - Positive, fits MacBook Pro - Positive, increases space - Positive.

Genius solution to a problem I didn’t know I had.. The Kallax stand is a wonderful solution to uplifting and upgrading the Kallax line of shelving. In my case, it lifted my horizontal, four bin unit to a more appropriate TV stand.;Genius solution - Positive, uplifting - Positive, upgrading - Positive.
Excellent option.. The Kallax is great and this option makes it even more versatile. I had a spot with floor vents and I wanted a 4x1 Kallax shelf to go there. It fit perfectly and the legs made it so it didn't block the vents.;4x1 Kallax shelf - Positive, fits perfectly - Positive, unblocks vents - Positive.
"Doesn't fit. Obviously I purchased this to get my Kallax up off the floor only to find out that this is longer and wider than my Kallax. My Kallax fits right down between the legs. I have the 8 cube Kallax and looking at the website it shows an 8 cube one sitting on the base. The joke is on me - the base is 58"" and my Kallax is only 51 3/4. I just assumed that the Kallax all had the same size base since it shows the 8 cube sitting on it. With the price of gas, I don't think it is wise to drive 2 hours to return a $20 item. Maybe I can repurpose it?";Longer and wider - Negative, does not fit Kallax - Negative.
Lightens visual weight. The Kallax legs are perfect to add just a little height and getting it off the floor makes it seem not so heavy visually;Adds height - Positive, perfect legs - Positive, lightens visual weight - Positive.
FINALLY!. This is a long overdue addition to the beloved Kallax series. I was able to put a kallax unit against the wall OVER a floor heating vent. It looks fantastic as a sideboard in my dining room.;Long-overdue addition - Positive, looks fantastic - Positive.
Simple, nice stand. The shelf has small knobs attached to it, provided in the stand kit, and simply sits upon the stand. The small knobs keep the shelf from shifting on the stand.;Simple stand - Positive, shelf sits upon stand - Positive, small knobs keep shelf stable - Positive.

"Nice Architectural Piece. This unit is amazing for a small apartment and was actually easy to assemble if you do so on the floor and watch the video.

Perfect low height bookshelf. We had been on the lookout for some bookshelves that would fit below our windows. These were the exact perfect height. We bought two to spam the 8ft windows. Construction is very solid and sturdy, which is expected considering the price. I really like the look of how the meta grabs the shelf. Easy to assemble and took less than 30 mins for each unit.

Nice piece for organizing. Good quality furniture.

Great Bookshelf. We had been looking for a slightly taller bookshelf to replace our 3 shelf Billy but that wasn't as tall as the 79 version and saw this in the showroom. The color is wonderful and the fact that it is made out of hardwood was such a nice surprise for the price. My only complaint (and it's barely a complaint) is that the middle shelf cannot be adjusted, though I understand why (to help with the stability of the shelf itself). Normally, I don't have any issue with IKEA instructions during assembly but I did have some difficulty figuring out which pieces were which a few times as they're not clear on the instruction pages but once I figured it out, assembly was quick. It looks great and we are planning to buy the matching coffee table and tv stand. :);Slightly taller bookshelf - Positive, Made of hardwood - Positive, Nice surprise - Positive, Non-adjustable middle shelf - Neutral.

Would Not Recommend. This piece is not as easy to put together as some reviews say. Nowhere in the instructions does it say a rubber mallet (or similar) is needed to make sure the pieces fit snugly together.  One review also said the pieces are numbered—no they are not. So I had to take apart one whole shelf because on the last piece the holes and knobs were not the same distance apart and would not fit together.  I was under the impression that some hardware would come with this combination to interlock the 2 shelves together. That's not the case. Also, there are no pilot holes drilled into the bottom of the shelves so I have to figure out how to do that myself.  It would've been cheaper to buy all the pieces separately, and that would've been a better representation of what you're getting yourself into. I'd give it 1 star, but once you wrestle everything together it looks alright.;Not easy to put together - Negative, no rubber mallet needed warning - Negative, pieces not numbered - Negative, hardware not included - Negative, no pilot holes drilled - Negative.
Not Easy to Assemble. I like the look of this shelving unit, however the assembly process was difficult. The shelving unit isn’t assembled by screws, you have to line them up and it’s a slide-and-lock process. This was challenging and created some scuffs. Just a warning, it’s challenging! I haven’t bought IKEA furniture before, so this was my first experience and I’m a little disappointed in this product.;Not easy to assemble - Negative, look of shelving unit - Neutral, slide-and-lock process - Neutral, scuffs - Neutral.
Rip off. This comes in two shelves without a way to attach them that doesn’t cost you extra money you have to put out. It would’ve been cheaper just to buy two of the shelves and put them together;Comes with two shelves - Neutral, no way to attach them - Negative.
"Terrible. Probably the worst product in IKEA. It is supposed to be easy to install but it's exactly the opposite. This ""hook"" system is absolutely terrible. I will NOT recommend this product. It looks ""innocent"" but it's a disater !";Easy to install - Negative, hook system - Negative, looks innocent - Neutral.
WORD OF WARNING. I bought this in combination with the EKET Glass doors no. 304.289.01 and the glass doors fell short dimensionally. I miss the days when you could buy Kallax cabinets with glass doors that fit just like their solid cubby doors. (((sigh)));Kallax cabinet - Neutral, glass doors - Negative.
Kallax products are great!. I love this product!;Great product - Positive, love the product - Positive.
Works fine but there is room for improvement. 1. I really want to see other color options, matching all colors available for Kallax cubes. 2. I'd also love to see more configurations, because 1 shelf is too generous, and 3 shelves are too tight for my needs (sheet music). May be, pre-drilled inserts with additional shelves sold separately to allow configurations of 1, 2, 3, or 4 shelves at customer discretion. 3. It would be nice if these inserts were compatible with door inserts. And it is definitely overpriced in my opinion.;Works fine - Neutral, room for improvement - Neutral, other color options - Neutral, more configurations - Neutral, overpriced - Negative.
Great addition to shelving unit. These drawer and door insets for the shelving unit are visually appealing, easy to assemble and make organizing real easy.;Visually appealing - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, make organizing easy - Positive.
Not sure how I feel. I thought I had these pieces push all the way in when putting this together so when I out it in my brand new kallax cube, it scratch the white up inside. So disappointing. There should be better instructions. I even used the padding on the edges that came with it but it still scratched the pain and now my shelve has scratch marks on it. I like the divider but not what it did to my new cubes;Scratched new cube - Negative, disappointing - Negative, divider - Neutter.
Give just the right amount of lift. Raises my Kallax of of the floor and gives it a more polish look.;Gives lift - Positive, polished look - Positive.

Better Storage In Just Five Minutes. This is - by far - one of the easiest pieces of furniture to assemble you can purchase from IKEA. It will take about five minutes to assemble and give you a ton of options for storing things. Great for organizing any size space. Empty cubbies especially get a seal of approval from my cat.;Easiest to assemble - Positive, takes 5 minutes - Positive, gives options for storing - Positive, great for organizing - Positive, cat-approved cubbies - Neutral.
Terrible Assembly Instructions!. I just finished assembling eight cubes. The cubes look great in our home office, but the assembly instructions are some of the worst I have ever encountered, and I am a technical writer. It took an hour to assemble the first cube. I had to take it apart once and that was no easy task. Once I figured it out, the remaining seven cubes only took 5 minutes each to assemble. The assembly video makes it look so easy, and it would have been with better instructions. It shows a woman snapping the sides together and then pushing them flush with her hands. Impossible. I used a rubber mallet. My husband couldn't even push them flush with his bare hands. Also, there were several plastic parts included with the cubes, but I couldn't figure out what they were for or how to even install them. I looked for info on the IKEA website but could not find anything. I'm using the cubes without the plasticware, and they seem to be just fine.;Terrible assembly instructions - Negative, hours-long assembly - Negative, looks great - Positive, Cubes - Neutral, impossible assembly without tools - Negative, plastic parts - Neutral.
Love it!. There's too many black shelving units in my place so I thought I'd go for a brighter unit. So glad I did! I love this for my media/turntable/vinyl/cds/art books collection. I hope thet make a dvd shelf unit.  Also easy to put together.;Brighter unit - Positive, love it - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive.
Misleading Looks. The product page pictures doesn't follow the directions to the underframe manual. If you follow the directions of the manual, it requires to flip the shelf on its side to install the underframe. One side of the shelf is unpainted and it gets exposed when it's flipped. Also, when the shelf is flipped sideways the little wooden dowels is going to be the main supports to hold items in each slot instead of the solid boards for each layer. The shelf is fine by itself, but addition of the underframe feels like an afterthought by the designer.;Misleading product page - Negative, requires flipping for underframe installation - Neutral, unevenly painted - Neutional, little wooden dowels as main supports - Negative.
Best supporting theme. The item fully supports the theme my daughter is creating and allows her creativity to flow.;Supports theme - Positive, allows creativity to flow - Positive.
Raised base for Kallax works great. Adding the raised base to the Kallax units makes them look more like a piece of furniture than a box. It also assists in accessing electric outlets that are located behind the unit. It prevented blocking one of the air vents for the heating system too. The connection system is slick and very easy to do. Two suggestions: if youa re putting the shelf in front of an electric outlet place a power strip in it before attaching to the wall and tuck it under the shelf. And you really need to fasten the shelves to the wall when using the raised base or it will not be stable.;Raised base - Positive, looks like furniture - Positive, assists access to electric outlets - Positive, prevents air vent blocking - Positive, easy connection system - Positive, fasten shelves to wall - Suggestion: place power strip - Neutral, suggestion: securely fasten to wall - Neutral.

As expected.. The Kalyan cube is sturdy and works for storing fabric in my quilt room. It was easy to assemble even for me, a 71 year old female. My daughter had to help me lift it onto a credenza as it was too heavy for me to lift by myself. I have the cube running sideways not standing tall. I am extremely pleased with this purchase.;Sturdy - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, Extremely pleased - Positive.
Perfect piece. This had easy to explain directions, was easy to put together, and it helps me keep organized.;Easy to put together - Positive, helps keep organized - Positive, easy to explain directions - Positive.
Update to Questionable Quality review. Ok this big daddy does not want to work out for me. The holes aren’t deep enough for the dowels and can’t be drilled deeper. I’ve had to cut all the dowels down 1/4” inch which is completely absurd. The smaller 8 cube came together easily, but not this 16 cube. I’m literally traumatized. So quality is not questionable anymore but clearly lacking!;Holes not deep enough - Negative, cannot be drilled deeper - Negative, dowels had to be cut - Negative.
Great choice for us. We bought the Four high by five across Kallax and 2 two by five Kallaxs for our needs. The small ones can be put together by one person but do need two people to lift on to the base (which we chose to purchase for one of the 4x5 Kallax). The larger Kallax does require two people to put together and to put up on its base (we chose to purchase the base). The second 2x5 Kallax was put on top of the 4x5. Because we have baseboard trim, everything was anchored to the walls. It was great that the wall anchors were included.;Four high by five Kallax - Positive, two by five Kallax - Positive, anchored to walls - Positive, includes wall anchors - Positive.
A good case for our records. Pretty sturdy and easy to assemble. I wish they would come in other wood colors, though.;Sturdy case - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive, wish other wood colors - Neutral.

excellent addition. I purchased 3 Kallax during the anniversary sale, they look great for storing my books and nik-naks . Unfortunately when assembling the one Kallax I must have forced the joint and the shelf literally exploded. I need to contact service to see if I can obtain a shelf.;Great for storing - Positive, looks great - Positive, unfortunate assembly experience - Negative.
. I thought this would be harder to build than it was. My tip on this piece is to have a helper or something to push against when you screw in the main screws. Then do not add the last shelves till you do the other wall with the double screw holes, then flip, add the last two shelves and the last other piece. I love this piece so much I am considering to get two more to place on both sides of the fire place.;Easier to build than expected - Positive, need help during assembly - Neutral, tip for assembly - Neutral, considering getting additional units - Positive.
Surprising use…. We purchased this for my daughter’s dorm room… as a bedside table next to bunk beds!

Cost reduced Expedit... misleading presentation. I have this 4-cubby piece in EXPEDIT, bought a few years ago. It worked really nicely as a warm, textured catch-all in our open entrance. So when we needed to extend the storage space, I did not think twice about buying another one. Not remembering the original name, I saw this and bought it in the black-brown color. It is not the same -- not even a bit. The chunky edges are no more, the warm dark wood is similarly named (black-brown), but now it's a wood-textured black -- no brown detectable. What was mis-leading was that in the store, they still showed an Expedit piece, warm brown color which turns out does not exist in Kallas. So I brought home the boxes... What a mistake... The piece measurements are the same on paper, but the actual measurements are smaller. Whereas the original Expedit had personality and warmth, this could well live in a conference room and nobody would bat an eye. Not quite 1 star, because the functions are ok -- I do like the drawers, even if they have shallow sides (1/2 of the door heights) and flimsy hardware (plastic tightening screws, and nuts). I would definitely have bought a different color had I realized this was different. Now where can I find an Expedit cubby?;Misleading presentation - Negative, original Expedit - Positive, functions ok - Neutral, shallow drawers - Neutral, flimsy hardware - Negative.

Awesome size for storage - looks great!. I bought this for my craft/sewing room and cannot believe how much it holds! There is even plenty of room on top for larger boxes or bins. Everything looks neat behind cube bins and I can find what I need almost instantly. Assembly is surprisingly simple, but I did need an extra set of hands just because of the size of the unit.;Great size for storage - Positive, looks great - Positive, holds a lot - Positive, easy assembly - Neutral, neat organization - Positive.

New design. Prefer the old design with boxed sides v this new flimsy side panel. Looks cheap when drawers are open;New design - Neutral, prefer old design - Negative, open drawers - Negative, flimsy side panel - Negative.
No screws. I bought this thing and it came in but now I can't find any screws or pegs or anything. I've opened every box and Googled everything I can think of but I can't figure it out. It's been hours and I'm very frustrated as I'm not sure I can package this up to send it back since the boxes are torn now.;Came with no screws - Negative.
Horrible and disappointing design. I've been putting together Ikea furniture for 20+ years. I saw a picture of the mitered edges with the keyhole fasteners before purchasing and thought to myself that this will work great or not at all. Unfortunately, it was the latter. The holes were not cleanly drilled so the boards did not slot together without significant force (even before I tried to get the last piece on). When I tried to take it apart, because I couldn't get the last piece on, it was impossible. Would not recommend ANY Ikea product with this new construction.;Horrible design - Negative, disappointing - Negative, mitered edges - Neutral, keyhole fasteners - Neutral, not slotting together - Negative, not reversible - Negative.
Not so easy to assemble. It is poor quality stuff.;Not easy to assemble - Negative, poor quality - Negative.

FANTASTIC for storing Vinyl Records!. I had found another product to store vinyl records that was almost 3x the cost but it was backordered and I'm glad it was. This is so much nicer for a fraction of the cost. The construction is more solid and the stand makes it look alot more expensive then it is. It wasn't difficult to put together and is holding his 500+ album collection beautifully. This is by far the best solution for the price that I found-HIGHLY recommend!!;Stores vinyl records - Positive, nice construction - Positive, holds album collection - Positive, affordable - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, good value - Positive.

Long time favorite…but. Our family has loved these shelves, we all have them in our homes, some have been passed down over time. Over the years we bought the Kallax’s predecessor (name currently escapes me). We were skeptical about the change to the Kallax but still tried them and found them to work. However, the nature of the Kallax has changed and I’m not sure it is for the better. Our older shelves were strong and heavy and survived several moves quite well. But these new ones are as light as if they were made from spun sugar and feel rather insubstantial, as if they are purposely made not to last. It was quite a surprise as it has only been a few months since we bought others so the change seems quite recent. Time will tell but I doubt we will buy any more.;Long time favorite - Positive, Survivable - Positive, heavy and strong - Positive, new Kallax - neutral, insubstantial - Negative.
Beautiful, functional and durable. I love this shelving unit! The thicker side edges make it look higher end and it was easy to assemble.

Luving Kallex Cube Stands!!. This is my 2nd Kallex 8 Cube Stand. I especially love the high gloss of the gray one and the white one.

Amazing!. I love the Kallax series! I have so many already. I live in an apartment and it's hard to get traditional bulky furniture up 3 flights of stairs. I bought some Kallax units to solve that problem! They are light but sturdy and easy to maneuver and bring move up/down stairs. I also love how I can choose which cubes to put in them!;Light but sturdy - Positive, easy to maneuver - Positive, can be brought upstairs - Positive, customizable - Positive.

Kallax shelves are the best. These shelves are practical not only for the bedroom, but for any room - even the closet.

The dim. Changed compared to my old Kallax. Bought 3 new units from IKEA for my new home and just realized IKEA had changed the thickness of the frames, the older one looks more durable and solid but thicker than all the new ones, had to find a different location for the existing one and spend more dollars .. over all they are still good though;Thick frames - Neutral (previous model) Negative (current model), had to find different location - Negative, spending more dollars - Negative.
Good value. At ordered two of these for the kids playroom, to help conceal the unsightly amount of random toys! I had to pick them up from an associated delivery center (for a very reasonable fee). One of the shelves was damaged upon arrival, which I didn't notice until assembly (it was the LAST shelf). I notified customer service and they went above and beyond by delivering strsight to my door. The shelves are working great so far...time will tell on the wear and tear!;Good value - Positive, conceal toys - Positive, damaged shelf - Neutimental, above and beyond customer service - Positive.
Perfect size. Nice little unit for clothing. I bought 4. They fit in small places or hallways.;Perfect size - Positive, nice unit - Neutral, fits in small places - Positive.

Might be useful if wider and and slightly deeper.;Too narrow - Negative, most likely fits 4 books - Neutative, serves as DVD display - Positive, loses storage space - Negative, slightly deeper - Neutative.
Previous version is much better. I had a couple of these series (2X4) of shelf at home. I've been a fan of this so far, but the recent version, which is thinner and not smooth wood and easy scratching, is not a good quality.;Recent version - Negative, thinner - Neutative, not smooth wood - Negative, easy scratching - Negative.
Major problem. Received this not two hours ago. Unpacked and started assembling. There are printing marks all over the face of at least one of the drawers. I am not able to return it as I have no way to get it there, and even if I could drive 40 miles to do so, I have no time. No matter how much I like Ikea, I have to give this one the lowest rating possible. First time Ikea's let me down. The ratings below apply to this individual piece I purchased, NOT to the line, as a whole. I really do like Kallax -- just not this eyesore I'm stuck with. Yes, the product WORKS as expected. Just looks like misery. Can't believe I paid hard earned money for this.

Love this little shelf!. This is one of my favorite shelves. I bought one and found it very easy to put together so I went back to buy a few more.   A tip I would give is to not tighten the screws in as you go. Wait until all the screws are in place and then tighten them all up at the end. I didn’t use the little middle piece and these shelves work wonderfully and look good too, imo!;Easy to put together - Positive, bought multiple - Positive, no need to tighten screws as you go - Neutral, looked good - Positive.
Handy rolling storage. Moderately easy to put together, solid considering the materials, rolls well. I bought it to store documents and files as it was much less expensive than a filing cabinet.

Great little Bookcases. I got two and considering getting another. They’re the perfect size for my space. Assembly was easy, don’t think it took me more than 30 min to build both.

It’s great but.... I had trouble screwing in the 2 little holes for the little triangle thing u put at the back of the shelf so I left one nail out bc I could not get it through, only half way. So I just left it out seeing I got 2/3 nails in. I also noticed already a few black marks on the shelf n a little scratch on the glass. I would buy this again but just upset with everything mentioned.

For the price it's good.. These are really cute. They're pretty sturdy. They should be simple enough to put together but they are a pain. The position of the screws is so difficult. Definitely put strains on your hands. And it didn't even come with a screwdriver that fit so I had to find one. Also on mine I Have the warning stickers on my poles and I can't get them off. That's why I rated it three stars instead of four. I bought four of them and they all had stickers there.;Cute design - Positive, sturdy - Positive, assembly - Negative.
Good shelf - terrible assembly. It took me two hours to get this together. It is very difficult screwing the screws in - which is basically the entire assembly process.

The Billy Bookcases are better. I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. Online it said they were in stock. Even at the store it said they were in stock, but they weren't. Since I do not live close to the store, I did not want to waste my trip and so I settled for buying the Kallax bookcases instead. I bought 4 of them, all different sizes. I was very disappointed.   Regardless of size they are held together with 8 screws and wooden dowls. The wooden dowls do not fit well into the holes. Since they are a few inches long but thin, a few of them broke. Luckily I have tools and my own dowl jig so I drilled them out, widened the holes and used bigger dowls.  I also had to use a rubber mallet to tap the dowls fully into the holes. I then had to also use the mallet to tap everything together because I could not push everything together snuggly and I'm pretty big.   I eventually got everything together but it was a lot more work than it needed to be. They can either use thicker dowls and/or drill their holes ever so slightly bigger so everything will fit together easily.   I never had these problems when assembling their Billy bookcases of which I have 12 or 13 of.;Disappointed with Kallax - Negative, wooden dowels do not fit well - Negative, had to use tools to assemble - Neutral.
assembly not as before. The unit itself is fine once it's assembled. But the old design (was it Expedit?) was much easier to assemble.

A great piece for any room. This was easy to put together and is exactly what I needed in my living room! I added colorful Bins from Target that fit perfect.;Easy to put together - Positive, great for any room - Positive, exactly needed - Positive, colorful bins - Neutral.
Storage unit is good. My daughter's room smells like a funeral and has for many days due to the formaldehyde off-gassing. Legally it can have formaldehyde as it is not labelled as children's furniture. Also, I had this delivered and had two #2 boxes delivered instead of a #1 & #2. After approximately 5 hours waiting on the phone and being transferred around (yes, really) the girl completely messed it up again so I ended up driving to an Ikea location to fix it. So I paid $50 for delivery for nothing, wasted many hours and had no apology. I was and continue to be kind as I have worked in retail and know how it is. I would very much consider this information however if you have no vehicle and are hours from a location.;Storage unit - Neutral, formaldehyde off-gassing - Negative, Ikea delivery - Negative, long wait on phone - Neutive, wasted hours - Negative.

NIGHTMARE to assemble, total garbage. I've been assembling Ikea furniture for over 30 years for both my home and businesses and I have never encountered such a frustrating build!! I always read Ikea assembly instructions thoroughly but no matter how carefully I followed them, it was a disaster. A total loss for me as the thing was so shreaded beyond functionality just from trying to put it together that it went into the garbage because my nearest Ikea store is over 2 hours away to return its pathetic scraps.

These are awful. If you ever purchased an older version of this you will hate this new version. You have to screw these into the shelving structure, so once they are there, they aren't moving unless you want to see all of the holes left behind. Being able to change how you used these in the old version was a great feature (especially if you move a lot). The older version had deeper drawers and were quite substantial. I am very disappointing in this new version. Quality is very low and it is not easy to install.;Awful - Negative, new version - Negative, required screwing into structure - Negative, lack of flexibility - Negative, low quality - Negative, challenging installation - Negative.
The drawers are REALLY shallow. This looks like it contains two drawers that each take up roughly half the space in one cube of the Kallax shelf. WRONG - it has two fronts that each take up half the space. The sides of the drawers are roughly half as high as the front of the drawer. So, you can only store about 3 worth of stuff in each drawer. What's the point?;Really shallow drawers - Negative, each front takes up half the space - Neutral, drawers have low height sides - Negative
I loved it so much I bought a second one!. I purchased the 25 cube Kallax with 6 inserts about 6 months ago for my foyer. I love it and admire it every time I walk by it. It’s big, it’s organized, and it is very beautiful. The pictures don’t compare to it in person. I had been recently looking online for a piece for my bedroom. So I purchased the 25 cube Kallax with 10 inserts this time and it’s perfect for us. I am thinking about getting one for my son’s room as well.

. Used these to create a couple of wall-mounted “floating” nightstands. Very easy to assemble. The wall attachment rails (purchased separately) make it easy to install. Just be sure to use appropriate mounting hardware that can support 30lbs or more. Not sure I would use it for anything too heavy, but works for supporting a few books and bedside light.;Easy to assemble - Positive, wall attachment rails - Positive, can support 30lbs - Neutral.
Holes wrong size. The predrilled holes all seemed to be the wrong size. We broke 2 wooden dowels trying to fit them in the holes before we decided to return it. So the halves of the wooden dowels are just permanently stuck in there. And we had to keep pounding on them because when we put the little shelves into the big shelves, they wouldn’t sit flush against the big shelves because the dowels were sticking out too far. So I’m going to get the Better Homes and Gardens version I stead which I had a far easier time putting together. The instructions make more sense on BHG too.;Predrilled holes - Negative, wrong size - Negative, wooden dowels - Neutral, instructions - Positive.

Used to LOVE them. I just picked up 3 KALLAX two cubbie by two cubbie storage shelves. I have a whole craft room done in these storage units and I loved them so I went back for a couple more. This batch is AWFUL. The screw holes don't align. I had to sit on them to push them into place so I could screw them together. 1 shelf used to take about 15 mins for me to assemble, now more like 40 mins of wrestling the piece into submission so I can get it together. UNFORTUNATE!;Used to love them - Negative, cubbie by cubbie storage shelves - Neutral, awful batch - Negative, misaligned screw holes - Negative.
Soft dowels snapped off. The kallax unit looks great, but was difficult to assemble due to the breaking dowels. The holes are machined tight, and the dowels are soft - 4 dowels snapped in assembly. Why not throw in a couple extra dowels?;Looks great - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative, breaking dowels - Negative.
Broken. I bought 2 of these and unfortunately the edge was cracked and split on one of them. Also I have bought several in past, not same quality.;Broken edge - Negative, unfortunate experience - Neutral, not same quality - Negative.
Solid classic, was not disappointed. There's a reason Ikea has sold Kallax for so long. It's sturdy and can be used in so many ways. This one is going in a bedroom to organize craft items. I expect to have this piece for the foreseeable future.  Side note: I bought Kallax in black for my living room earlier this year. A 4x4 with a 2x4 stacked on top, holding about 2000 books. Obviously very happy with my purchase.;Classic design - Positive, sturdy - Positive, long-lasting - Positive, multiple uses - Positive.

Kallax. So sad not to have my Expedit as an option. These are ok but the others were far superior (I had them over a decade and 3 major moves). My recommendation is based sadly on the fact that there is no longer the previous version. Less sturdy at a higher price. Like the appearance with the wider edge of the Expedit.;Appearance - Neutral, Wider edge - Neutral, Previous version - Positive, Sturdier - Positive, Higher price - Negative.
Good & long-lasting but needs better options.. We still have one bought back in 2005!!! That's over 12 years and no peeling or breakages despite it has been holding quite a number of books and the overall weight was rather hefty (although we did put the heaviest at the bottom and lightest at the top). We recently purchased a second unit with the intention to put it on wheels. If you think about doing the same, I would not go that route unless you plan to use it only for lightweight items, not books. Even with 1/2 the books it could hold per square, the whole structure would be far too heavy to use the wheels provided by Ikea.  We actually added solid wood strips some 5 inches wide running front to back at the bottom and stained them in a dark color. The strip have been attached with screws on the frame of the bottom plank (the center of the base is hollow). Those served as support for the wheels which added separately as they had a higher load rating (still ikea ones), but even then the solution wasn't a viable option because the unit became too flimsy feeling when under load and would be unreliable for use with heavy items. So the books went back to the old unit which we had to keep stationary and not add any wheels. And this one will be used as a movable partition for storage of lightweight items while providing some privacy on the other side of it. The plan was to use 2 of these but we had to change solution. Also during the test under load, the wheel left some scoring in our hardwood floor (apparently much less hard than the plastic of the wheels) so that was a complete deal breaker even if the unit would have reveal itself to be more stable when moved around. One aspect in which I wish the design would have been revised is to see the gaps that always form in the middle that is large enough to show the dowels which are supposed to connect the vertical square panels to the top closing plank. A 3rd screw might also help make the frame a bit more rigid. Mind you that we have not clued anything together to be able to disassemble as needed... so with that considered it's still a pretty sturdy construction given its price point and overall quality construction. We haven't needed to use the anchoring (we also have no kids or pets in the house), but we'd recommend it if you live in areas with seismic activity or have kids and pets, even if you don't load the unit all that much. I wish it had better options (like a set of 8 softer and high-load carrying wheels) as well as a better design for the insert with door, which ends up having a very poor fit in many cases and will need to be heavily tweaked making it the more time intensive assembling task... they should be redesigned and changed to a thin frame holding the swinging panel door with small pins acting as stops to prevent the door from traveling inwards more than it should. The back plate could be much the same as long as machining will be kept as precise as possible. That said, if you use this as simple shelving unit to hold some books and display small object, it will serve you for years if not decades to come.;Durable units - Positive, long-lasting - Positive, gaps between panels - Neutitive, poorly fitting doors - Negative, sturdy construction - Positive, heavy load capacity - Positive, needs better wheel options - Negative, flimsy feeling - Negative.
Nearly perfect shelving unit. Firstly, I love my Kallax shelf unit. It works perfectly as a room divider for a small apartment and looks great overall. Definitely need at least two people to assemble, if only for the part where you sit the shelving unit right side up. I would give it five stars, however, multiple pieces arrived damaged (paint chipped off, multiple ~2 in gouges in the particle board). I'm sure Ikea would have replaced the damaged parts, but I was already at my wit's end after trying to return another item over the course of four weeks.;Nearly perfect shelving unit - Positive, works great as room divider - Positive, good looks - Positive, arrived damaged - Negative.
Kallax. It is the perfect size and storage for our guest room. IKEA has great storage options!;Perfect size - Positive, great storage - Positive, IKEA storage options - Neutral.
Nice Looking. The shelf itself is very nice and looks great. However, putting it together is a different story. There are no words in the directions--just diagrams. So if you have a hard time following diagrams you may want to think twice about purchasing. Advice to the purchaser: You will need at least two people to assemble this shelf, and you may argue during the process. Hopefully the two of you will get along.  Also, there are extra holes and have no idea what those holes are for. Advice to the company: In the future if you are not planning to use words in your directions it would be beneficial to the purchaser to at least label the the parts.;Nice looking - Positive, no words in directions - Negative, arguably difficult assembly - Neutral, extra holes - Neutral.

No replacement shelf. This could have been a good product. one of the interior shelves broke. Called Ikea, and they said they cannot replace it UNLESS you kept your receipt.  Seriously ? I'm willing to pay for the shelf, but you can't even do that unless you have a receipt. Ikea products are decent, but their service is such that you have to buy an entirely new unit, or keep the receipts for the entire life of the product.

. We bought this shelf unit as a cubby shelf for my daughter's playroom. I saw it online but wanted to see it in person before I purchased. Unit was better than I had expected.  Heavy duty metal material frame and shelves far exceed similar shelves at big box stores. Parts and assembly make the shelves super durable and the unit came with complimentary wall anchors to keep the shelf stable and upright -- not that they were necessary for us since the unit was pretty level and stable already. We have used the snap-and-lock storage bins from Walmart to store various toys and games on this shelf, rather like a large cubby shelf. It has been an amazing addition to the playroom and I'm so glad I made the purchase.  We've had this shelf for over 3 years now. We have moved and rearranged rooms and still this shelf looks as good as the day we bought it. Shame there isn't a way to include a pic with this review!

A little dissappointed. We love IKEA and have a number of shelving solutions from them but this one is a bit of a disappointment. Inconsistencies in the manufacture of the Kallax unit caused it to go together slightly out of square, with some gaps in the panels and misalignment of the face of the shelving.

Great piece, one small recommendation for improvement. This was surpisingly easy to put together, feels pretty sturdy, holds a lot and seems a really good value for the price. I got this with two sets of drawers which gives it a nice combination of hidden storage and open shelving. It wasn't obvious to me from looking at it online but you can set the shelves at different heights which is a plus. Unfortunately that leaves visible holes and the one thing I would recommend to Ikea for improvement is that you provide something to fill in the rest of the holes for a more finished look.;Easy to put together - Positive, Feels sturdy - Positive, Good value for price - Positive, Hidden storage - Positive, Adjustable shelves - Neutral, Visible holes - Negative.
So sturdy. We got this to use as storage for our kids clothes. We were shocked with how thick the wood is. It is so sturdy and we don’t worry about the kids breaking a shelf.

Beware the product has changed. They are advertising this as the same product using the same stock number but it is of significantly worse quality than it used to be.

Dowels/holes not a proper fit. We were very disappointed in this after easy assembly of the micke desk and malm dresser. Either the dowels were too long for one side or the holes weren’t drilled out properly, and it took entirely too long to put this together.

Easy to install, but some caveats. It was easy to install and adjust these, and the hinges seem to be quality. If installing these in the top corner slots, be aware that they block access to the wall anchor brackets, so you have to anchor the unit to the wall first.

Before you buy it, do this. Go to the store and look at the display units, specifically the doors. Chances are the door on the right hangs down a quarter inch lower than the other one.

A little underwhelming. I really love IKEA products and I have a lot of IKEA items in my home. I waited almost two years to get this Kallax 5x5 with 10 inserts, due to supply issues during the pandemic. So I was very excited when it was delivered. Assembly was a bit more difficult than I have found with other furniture I have put together. Some of the holes did not line up. One of the inserts was very damaged. The piece that is screwed into the cabinet is supposed to be all one piece that folds to fit into the cabinet. The damaged insert was broken into three pieces.

"Love it, but it's better if you assemble it ""wrong"". Major upgrade to our kallax that we had been using as a TV stand! However, I did not like adding the bracket to the outside of the shelf, so I flipped it, still on the same bolt, but I put the bracket in the seam where the bottom board and side come together. It makes a little gap but in my opinion looks much better than a bracket on the outside.

I think one of the sides is slightly longer than the other which makes the whole thing shift up on the right hand side.

"Sturdy and elegant bookcase. All the bookcases of Kallax (any dimension by any dimension) are sturdy and nice looking. It can be placed in any direction (3 or 4 ""cubes"" vertical) which makes it very practical and versatile. Each ""cube"" is the perfect size to store books, clothes and toys (using colorful baskets) or just place decorations. The top surface can be used as storage surface or when placed the long dimension horizontal as sitting area. The assembly is a bit labor intensive but that brings its sturdiness.

Poor return policy. Very disappointed with this purchase. IKEA intentionally disguised the box to look undamaged so it would be purchased. We inspected the box at the warehouse and it appeared fine. Upon unboxing at home we found two big gashes in the board from pallet forks and when we matched the damage to the box we then noticed brown tape strategically placed over the exterior box damage!

It is very poor quality for it priced. It arrived damaged. When we were assembling the dividing cubes they were cracking already. I wish I could show a picture or a video. When you use hammer for pushing wooden sticks it cracks the shelve. After we assembled it, we couldn’t believe how unstable it was. It doesn’t hold well after all that cracked parts of shelves.

Almost perfect. This is an excellent and versatile piece - super easy to put together and is plenty strong for the heavy books I put in them, and they are not too heavy so easy to move around. It would be 100% perfect if there was an easy leg-system that was adjustable.   The steel frame leg is nice but was too tall to have the shelf fit under my windowsill, I ended up buying couch legs that screw on but they are not very easy to secure in the thin wood--esp. in the middle where I wanted a third support. If there was some kind of attachment that would allow for flexibility on this it would be absolutely perfect.

"It is good so far, but took me 3 weeks to put together.. Customer service needs a little help. Apparently, no one knows that this particular product has the only 3x3 shelves with four holes on a single shelf.   I had a misaligned shelf while I was putting it together, and the dowels went through the side. I drove to Ikea to get a single replacement shelf.   They sent me home with a shelf with only two holes on each side. I called customer service, and they said they would send me a replacement. They sent the outside support, not a single shelf.   I called customer service and told them that maybe the third time was the charm. I found someone who walked me to the correct page in the product instructions and told her exactly what piece I needed. She told me she was writing notes and then never sent the board.   I called a week later to follow up, and they did not indicate someone sending anything. So I had to drive to IKEA— half an hour's drive, about an hour for them to make me the right piece—go home another 1/2 hour.   They don't want to replace the shelves; I would have paid for the correct piece. It was my error. But no one knew they didn't even have them to replace them.   Number all the parts. I would pay a nominal fee to replace something I broke instead of dumping the whole thing in the trash because you want to sell more products.   This is an environmental issue.

Pretty good, overall.. It's not as hard to put together as some here seem to suggest, there are a lot of screws to tighten, so a small electric screwdriver might save you some grief. About 1.5 hours at a leisurely pace to assemble, with hand tightening. Every connection is secured with a screw, no snap fit or glued parts. I was worried there might be warpage or misalignment with the steel structure, but it came out surprisingly straight and sturdy. One of the inner wooden shelves was a slight tight fit and took some pressure to squeeze in, I didn't notice any bowing of the frame or the shelf, but I'll probably sand it slightly just in case. I noticed the wood screws slipped when tightening about 3/4 the time, so I'd suggest going easy on tightening once you feel the resistance increasing. In any case, they offer sufficient support to anchor the wood well onto the frame. I wish the wood was slightly thicker and substantial, but it's not flimsy either. I don't know how it would hold up to moisture, but it does have a finish on it.;Pretty good - Neutral, not hard to assemble - Neutral, leisurely assembly - Neutral, secure connections - Positive, wood screws slipped - Neutral, adequate support - Neutral, finish on wood - Neutral, thickness of wood - Sentiment: Neutral.

Expect defects. Purchased July 2017, and the product was defective and damaged. Damaged part: One of the connecting posts that's supposed to slide into a connecting hole was busted and manufactured at an angle so that it could not enter in the connecting bit. I ended up taking a hammer to straighten the piece out, which luckily did the trick. Defective part: One of the long posts was not produced with the correct bottom. The bottom side of the posts have a place to screw in a piece, but one of my posts had two top sides, so the whole shelf is lopsided. I also ran into a lot of issues assembling this shelf.

Looks good, but some construction issues. This is a very nice shelving unit, and just the size I needed. There were, however, some issues putting it together. The wooden pegs for the shelving were the right size for the internal shelves, but too long for the frame. I now have small gaps between the shelves and the frame, which has affected the smooth running of the drawers I purchased. The drawers and doors I bought were very easy to put together, though I had to adjust the screw positions when attaching their frames as the screws on one side of the partitions hit the screws on the other side.

The Kallax 4 x 4 is an attractive answer to storage, display. My wife and I put it together in an hour or two. Instructions were clear.

Great cubby. Overall I'm happy with my kallax purchase. A few issues I wasn't too thrilled with: charging an extra $10 for the gloss colorway is ridiculous, the sides of the unit do not match up flush with the top & bottom edges, and leaving the screw ends exposed makes the unit feel unfinished.

Would not recommend for vinyl storage with outer sleeves. I bought this based on other reviews stating they used this for vinyl storage. If you archive your vinyl in outer sleeves, then I would not recommend this unit. Bare vinyl covers just barely clear the opening and not all of my vinyl covers fit. I previously bought the 4 cube EKET and that works perfectly. About a 1/2 inch of clearance above vinyl covers giving plenty of extra room. I didn't have enough room for another 4 cube EKET, so I went for 2 single cubes and these do not have the same interior dimensions.

EKET Shelf. I assembled four shelves and joined them together. The end product is functional and beautiful, but I had the most difficult time in the assembly process. The back board that slides into place was about an eighth of an inch too tall which made assembly impossible. I finally used an exacto knife and scored it on both sides to remove this extra height. Once I did that, it went together perfectly. It seems the back board was not cut properly. Once I figured out what I had to do, I assembled the remaining EKETS easily.

The square beyond compare!. Let’s start with price: for the functional utility of this unit it can’t be beat. We already had the 12 square unit, which I used for stacking t-shirts and clothing and quickly outgrew. An upgrade to the 16 square unit was a no-brainer and has allowed me much needed storage space that would have otherwise clinically classified my t-shirt buying hobby as hoarding. Truth be told, my wife was sick of me stacking shirts around the room, on the top of dressers and night stands, that something had to give. To say I really needed this item is an understatement. As with most IKEA products there was a little assembly required that I initially dreaded since I didn’t help with the construction of the 12 square unit and therefore didn’t know what to expect.

"Will not fit records or record player. I got this to use as a record box. The dimensions seemed like it would work. But I didn't mean to get the one with a door! I installed it anyway, because it was the first step of the instructions. But when I closed the door, the like, half-inch of space that the door takes up makes the box just barely too small for the records. It also will not fit my record player on top of it.

Great Shelf - Want More Colors. My sister had bought the 4x4 cube shelf from the kallax series and I absolutely loved it and wanted to get one for myself but the 4x4 was too big for my apartment and so decided to go with the 3x3 which is the perfect size.

Versatile, well-designed, sturdy. We bought two 4x4 Kallaxes for our family room to use a bookcases and grandchild toy storage. The variety of storage boxes makes the latter easy, and the 13” cubbies hold large books. Assembly was easy, but is best done with a helper. The components fit perfectly and securely.

So much storage for a great price. I've had this shelf up for 2 weeks now, and it looks fantastic. The assembly was not as smooth as other Ikea furniture I've put together, but I was able to do it with one other person without breaking any parts or getting injured. A lot of elbow grease is required. Also, I recommend using heavy duty snap toggle anchors if you're going to secure the shelf into drywall. The unit itself is crisp looking (though mine was dented on a side and I didn't notice until getting home) and quite versatile in terms of how you choose to dress it up. Very pleased with this unit.;Great price - Positive, looks fantastic - Positive, assembly challenging - Neutative, crisp looking - Positive, versatile - Positive, heavy duty anchors recommended - Neutral.

Perfect for my records. I bought three of these to hang on the wall in a custom arrangement to hold records. The pieces all snap together, but don't feel like they're going to fall apart (which is important since they're holding vinyl). Even with an extra hardware store run to get wall anchors, all three were assembled and hung on the wall in under 2 hours. I do have a few records that are in slightly taller gatefold cases or in their own box that were a tighter fit, but not unmanageable.;Custom arrangement - Positive, holds records - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, solid construction - Positive.

"Easily built, sturdy, and flexible use. I needed some extra storage space, and IKEA just happened to have a sale on for Kallax shelving. The second toughest part was probably deciding which one to get; the first was trying to move the superdense box (:D). But seriously, the different possible combinations of shelves (I almost got the 3x3 instead) and the treatments for the compartments (fabric or wicker baskets, drawers or cabinet doors, etc.?) makes them suitable for most any situation. I told my sister-in-law about the sale, and she drove down to pick up several. Whereas I needed the shelves for extra clothing in the bedroom, she wanted to improve her craft room storage. Putting my unit together wasn't too tough, and once stood up and filled still feels very strong.";Easily built - Positive, sturdy - Positive, flexible use - Positive, different combinations - Neutral.
Assembly is quick and easy. Just wanted to make a review addressing all the one star reviews. This box is super simple to build. If you can slide pieces together, you can build this box. It does require some common building sense. Rubber mallet is helpful but not necessary, as you can just use your weight to get the pieces to slide together. I've bought 12 of these, and only had one issue where one of the plastic connectors on a panel was not fully driven in, few wacks of the rubber mallet took care of it.;Easy assembly - Positive, quick assembly - Positive, common building sense - Neutral, rubber mallet - Neutral, sturdy box - Positive.

Bad Quality and Service. Really, had to do this review thing twice. It's ridiculous!Got the same unit before and noticed the material has degraded so much during installation.

Love it. We bought 2 of them for our office.  We modified them by adding stained wood to the outsides of them, but even without the additional modifications we did on our own, they are very sturdy and heavy duty. We purchased the extra drawers, doors, and casters and are very happy with how it provides stylish storage. They are going to last for a long time-they are not the cheap type of cubby systems that you get at a discount store that don’t hold up. We are very pleased.;Stylish storage - Positive, sturdy and heavy duty - Positive, long-lasting - Positive, heavy units - Positive, not cheap type - Positive.

Not recommended.. I own many Ikea products, and I am delighted with most of them. This particular item seems to be of lower quality than I have experienced with other Ikea pieces. The parts didn't line up as well as I have experienced in the past with other items. The worst part is the chemical smell. It smells like burning plastic. My throat was pretty irritated after assembling, but I figured that the smell would dissipate after a little while. Well, it's been two days, and I just finished moving both Kallax units to the backyard to get the smell out of the house. Hopefully, they will off-gas enough outdoors for me to bring them back inside. Otherwise, I will be returning these shelves.;Lower quality - Negative, parts didn't line up - Negative, chemical smell - Negative.

Missing shelf divider. We love all of the other Kallax pieces we have bought, but this most recent one that we are being asked to review was missing a major piece of wood, not just a little piece of hardware.

Great For Vinyl Collectors. Needed something for the vinyl records I collected over the years that I was keeping in boxes around my apartment. This did the trick, with 13x13 shelving space, it's the perfect size for the records whether you set it up vertically or horizontally. Really easy to set up. I'm not the best assembler, even with IKEA furniture, but I had this unit ready within 30 minutes.;Great for vinyl collectors - Positive, 13x13 shelving space - Positive, easy to set up - Positive.
Dissappointed. I put one of the units and was able to put it together myself. When I stood it up, I found one of the shelves was missing about 1/4” of The white edging was missing. IKEA was very helpful at replacing the part, however, now I have to disassemble and rebuild it. In the mean time, I had a tool with cushion feet on it. When I moved the tool, I found that some of the paint came off.;Missing white edging - Negative, had to replace - Neutative, paint came off - Negative.

Poor installation instructions.. First, do not use a claw hammer as illustrated in the installation guide. Use a rubber mallet will help protect the wooden pegs and edges of the shelves (when you have to tap the ends with 4 pegs. Horizontal shelves do not slide in like the illustration.  You have to tap hard to get them flush.  Second major problem is that there 3 different width to the interior shelves, and vertical and horizontal perimeter pieces. This makes it difficult to align the pegs with the holes when everything is laying flat (as recommended by the installation guide). You have to lift certain pieces off the floor by about 1/8 in order to match the holes with the pegs. Probably not so bad with smaller units such as 2 x 4, but it gets very heavy try to lift the pieces when you are almost done with the 5 x 5 unit. A word of caution. Once assembled the 5 x 5 unit, it is nearly impossible to move the unit because it is so darn heavy.  You literally have to dissemble everything if you were to move the unit to another location. There is no shear panel, so the unit will flex if you attempt to move it too far. Probably a better idea is two smaller units rather than one large unit such as the 5 x 5,;Poor installation instructions - Negative, not as illustrated in guide - Neutral, heavy unit - Neutimental, difficulties aligning pegs - Negative, not suitable for moving once assembled - Negative.
Just what we needed for a tiny bedroom. A beach house we manage has a tiny master bedroom, in which a huge old dresser occupied most of the floor space AND blocked the baseboard heater to boot. For about $200 we added three times as much usable storage space with the 8-section Kallax, adding doors and drawers to all 8 sections, and boosting it up off the floor and OVER the baseboard heater with Godmorgen feet. The room is so much more navigable, the heat now circulates freely, and there's room for a whole summer's worth of easily-accessible clothes. Took a little extra work, but it's a world of difference.;Small bedroom solution - Positive, adds storage space - Positive, navigable room - Positive, improves heat circulation - Positive.
Easy to assemble & Sturdy. I own a preschool and have purchased 7 Kallax units for my classrooms. I place them horizontal, and they're a great height for the children.  I've brought different colors (white, yellow, and pink- which is no longer made) over a year ago, and they still look like new. I just purchased black, awesome for the older children.

Nice Piece for lots of storage. I love this piece. I can hold a lot of stored items. I have had smaller version of this unit, this is the first large piece I have set up.

great value, cheap material, difficult assembly. The price is good for this product. appearance and feature is great.

Simple and sturdy. I’ve bought different combinations of the Kallax shelves over the last three years.

Great for my son's huge spaceships. I bought this for our playroom because my son's spaceship fleet did not have a space station.

Good but.... Directions indicate using a hammer to tap the shelves together. Unfortunately, any tapping WILL damage the finish/ crush some of the material that they're made from.;Directions indicate using a hammer - Neutral, damaging finish/crushing material - Negative.
Board split when putting it together. While this does feel a bit sturdy with weight on it, it wobbled a lot before adding things to the shelf. The wall brackets don't work due to the base boards (about an inch gap), so the entire shelf would have to be tilted to mount it to the wall. When we were putting it together, one of the holes on the board we had to put a peg in wasn't drilled/lined up properly, and a big chunk of the shelf came off. We glued it back on, and hope no one notices, because we don't have the HOURS it would take to stand in customer service waiting for a replacement board.;Board split - Negative, feels sturdy - Positive, wobbled before additions - Negative, wall brackets don't work - Negative.

KALLAX Insert with door. We left some shelves open, some we closed with boxes, and some with doors. Perfect. My only recommendation would be to include larger screws.

Used to be better. This is the second set of drawers I have. The first I purchased were $20, matte finish, quality solid hardware, and slide nicely and fit perfectly in my Expedit.

Love this shelf, However.. I have this shelf in another color in my home, So I decided to purchase it again for the storage space. However, when putting it together the top boards were wrong and I could not secure it with the screws. So it is loose. I do not live close to IKEA and didn't want to take the drive.

Just what I wanted.. Despite the frustration of putting together IKEA furniture, once it is complete and in its place, I quickly forget what it took to put it together.

Unbeatable. The Kallax units are unbeatable in design, flexibility, customization and quality/price ratio.

Must lay flat to assemble.. The biggest challenge when my husband and I assembled this was laying it flat to do so. The upstairs of our home doesn't have any open floor spaces that large. That said, we assembled this unit in 45 minutes working as a team. I loaded it with photo albums and books and other than the dark colored wood showing dust like crazy we have been very happy with our purchase. We have another unit ten years old that's the same unit from ikea and it held a teenagers stuff till a few years ago when she moved out and now it holds crafting stuff. It still looks brand new.; assembly requires flat surface - neutral, 45 minutes to assemble - Positive, holds photo albums and books - Positive, looks brand new - Positive.
Cheap fitting.... Hi, While the furniture looks great, really great, I wish the fasteners were not cheap wood. It would have liked cam fitting with cam locks. That would make the mounting earlier, less noisy (no need to hammer and possibly damage the furniture) and safer. The dismounting and moving of the assembled furniture would have been much easier.  And once assembled, I start seeing the part come apart more easily with the wooden fastening, suggesting I should have glued things (which makes the furniture a little less ikea style). :(; Looks great - Positive, cheap fasteners - Negative.

. I Love the inserts. Very easy to install, too.;Love the inserts - Positive, easy to install - Positive.
Cheap and flimsy. These look great, but the installation requires you to screw into the unit where there are no holes. This means that you cannot move the doors and drawers around within the unit once you have made your decision, as it leaves ugly screw marks behind. Also, if you make a mistake and dont screw perfectly straight, you have multiple holes which make the product even weaker. The door installed slightly askew, despite my following the directions very well (I have put together Lego Mindstorms, if that's any indication of my pictorial directions-following abilities). The other installed slightly too low so that it rubs against the lower end of the shelf every time you open or close it. I consider myself pretty good at putting these things together. I think it is just poor design and weak materials. I gave it two stars overall because it does look nice.;Cheap - Negative, flimsy - Negative, poor installation - negative, unsatisfactory design - Negative.
"Sturdy and functional. Extremely easy to assemble, great looking, and very sturdy!!! The only drawback was when we tried to add doors and drawers; they cannot be side-by-side due to the length of the screws. The shelves are not thick enough and the screws hit each other, keeping you from screwing them in correctly. We had to offset the doors and drawers or put them on top of each other. We used baskets for the other cubes.";Extremely easy to assemble - Positive, Great looking - Positive, Very sturdy - Positive, drawback (trouble adding doors and drawers) - Negative.

Cheap and shallow. While these drawers looks nice, they are made of weak material that I fear may rot in humid weather. I took the advice of another post that said not to screw the sides into the unit. I had already screwed into it though, so the holes are there, but the drawers would not fit unless I removed those screws. I do not recommend this product.

Excellent for beautiful and handy storage.. We have at least twelve of these now: seven for vinyl LP’s’ three for bedroom clothes storage, and two for bookcases. They adapt so well to most anything and fit sideways or upright into many small places.

great sturdy piece for smaller spaces. The assembly is a little tricker vs your average wooden IKEA shelving unit. Pay close attention to the orientation of the holes alongside the frames. Once put together it really elevated the look of my bedroom- this looks like shelving that other popular high end stores sell for hundreds of dollars.  Tips: It helps to not tighten all the screws all the way until the end- this makes all the screws easier to place without metal of the frame not quite lining up and blocking the way for the screws.  The bamboo top does NOT come with pre-drilled holes, but the wood is soft enough and the screws for that element are pointy enough that once you line it up properly with the frame (use painter's tape to hold it in place if needed) and use a firmer overpressure while placing the screws with a manual screwdriver, they will go in and catch the surrounding wood with no problems. I actually don't advise pre-drilling holes because if the holes are too large then the screws won't catch as securely.;Sturdy piece - Positive, smaller spaces - neutral, tricker assembly - neutral, solid bamboo top - Positive, requires attention to orientation of holes - neutral, elevated look - Positive, resembles high-end shelving - Positive, pre-drilled holes not advised - neutral.

Quite sturdy!. This is my third purchase of this product for my craft room and I totally love these shelves as they are so versatile in their usage. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I wanted this to match the ones I’ve bought in the past but they no longer carry the oak in the store near me so I had to get the white or black and decided on the white.

Great Look,Great Features,concerned about Quality. I purchased this to match another shelf in the series, and absolutely love the look and features. After waiting for months for this item to become available again, I looked forward to finally getting it home to put together. While I am mostly satisfied with the shelf, it seems the manufacturer rushed this batch and welded 2 components in the wrong direction! Another minor concern is that one of the doors does not line up with the other. I would think a proper Q/C inspection would have caught this. I ended up just removing the 2 components myself as the shelf will hold without them. Just wanted to leave constructive feedback so IKEA is aware!;Great look - Positive, Great features - Positive, concerned about quality - Neutative.
New version is total garbage. We have about 7 of older version of these and needed one more. New one is horrible. 5 of the edge veneers were 90% unglued and needed to be glued and clamped. In 3 spots wooden pegs into into voids (no wood behind the holes). In 2 spots wooden pegs broke through the exterior veneer leaving holes in the finish.

Reliable shelving. This shelving set was the right size and fits well with a desk I had bought previously from Ikea.

Using as a dresser. I bought the kallax along with 12 drona boxes to use as a dresser in my bedroom. The drona boxes are really deep, hold all my clothing perfectly.

Versatile, nice, modern.. Okay. I got this one because I wanted to get rid of the humongous entertainment center that I have. PROS: This came in handy being that it can be used in a vertical or horizontal way. It's not difficult to understand how to put it together, it takes little space when one has a small (office/living/dining) space. Clean, modern and versatile. CON: need two people to put it together if you don't have the space and or furniture to maneuver around it. The pegs need to be hammered in because no all holes are standard and some are smaller and is difficult for the pegs to go in. One has to do so very carefully. Otherwise, since is made of pressed sawdust, it becomes very easily to crack the edges. I don't remember if it states on the directions, but one needs a star screwdriver to put the little thingies that are mounted to the wall. No. It doesn't fit my cable box, but I have enough books to fill it in.;Versatile - Positive, modern - Positive, vertical and horizontal - Positive, easy assembly - neutral, small space-friendly - Positive, not difficult to understand - Positive, clean - Positive, pressed sawdust material - Negative, difficult peg installation - Negative.

Great to help utilize the gaps in Kallax cubes. I bought this to go with two Kallax that are now being used as an entertainment center. The basket is great for my DVD player and roku to suspend up from the top of a cubby while sliding a smaller storage box underneath. Very stylish. One recommendation though, is that you be sure you have it where you want it and any electrical cords situated *before* you latch the back, because it is really difficult to unlatch if you decide you want to move it to a different compartment. Otherwise, no complaints!;Utilizes gaps in cubes - Positive, great for storage - Positive, stylish - Positive, difficult to unlatch - Neutral.
Sturdy bookshelf!. We bought our first Kallax shelf unit seven years ago. We bought another one a month ago. There is a definite difference in weight of the product and a little difference in height and width. You can tell they’ve tried to save on materials. Notwithstanding, this product is still incredibly sturdy and meets our needs perfectly! We love this product! We have used it as a bookshelf for our home library and also a toy shelving unit with the colorful buckets you find everywhere. The square is the perfect dimension and fits things nicely.

Nice looking, hard to install. The initial idea of installing this isn’t hard - the doors also look nice & is a great addition to my 4x2 unit. It’s figuring out the latches and actually getting the door to close without completely unscrewing them. A lot of times I thought the door would be screwed into the body and the door would pop off. It’s more me than the door, but still a bit hard. Overall, it’s a decent product.;Nice looking - Positive, hard to install - Negative.

Looks great, nightmare to assemble. As others noted the assembly is not the familiar post and dowel. It took me 4 hours on one of the units, as the pins and holes were not aligned well. I finally succeeded but the 4 unit cube is not quite square. The underframe is slightly separated. The second one was okay but still an hard assembly. I like the white cube with the natural wood frame. Perfect for a flexible set of bookcases. Recommended for those with patience.;Attractive appearance - Positive, challenging assembly - Negative, natural wood frame - Neutral, flexible design - Positive.

Looks nice for the most part. Assembled by myself in about one evening. The white looks nice in our room. However, I feel there's a small defect in the design that is more apparent with white 5x5 KALLAXes than with other models--the outside vertical boards seem to bow outward a little bit, to the point that there's a small gap between them and the ends of the middle horizontal boards. I wish there was something I could do to remove or reduce that gap.;Nice looking - Positive, assembled easily - Positive, small defect - Neutral, bowed outward vertical boards - Neutral, gap between boards - Negative.

"ultimately serves the purpose. I bought this to fit a small space in my son's room. I stacked three of them, stair-stepper fashion, as a book shelf. They serve the purpose that I bought them for, but I struggled to put them together. I tried for hours to get them to click. I watched several videos. I pushed, I pulled, I pounded. I did not want to damage them, but they would not budge. I had two of them three-quarters built, but I could not get the last side on. I took them back to the store and asked an IKEA employee to help me; otherwise, I was going to return them. The employee did help me. He slammed them together, and I built the third one at the little station in the store and used the hammer to finish the fourth side. They are fine for a kid's room, but they are too frustrating to build.";Serves the purpose - Positive, small space - Neutral, struggle to put together - Negative, click into place - Negative.

love the piece but assembly issues. furniture pieces arrived damaged with 2 divits and a chip.I decided to keep it because retuning it would be a hassle. when putting pieces together wooden dowels would not fit into holes.

It looks expensive and elegant. We have a modern furniture in our living room, in colors of black and burnt honey. This piece looks perfect with it. We also purchased 3 cloth storage bins to fit in the bottom, where we store all of our dog's stuff... bags, leash, cookies, harness. That way those are hidden but convenient. We got many compliments and no one believes us that we bought it in Ikea.

The Worst. I brought this a month ago and it did not come with the screws for me to put the unit together. When I called the store about this problem they told me to contact the vendor who makes the unit. Needless to say I never got the screws and the unit is sitting and has not been put together. The unit cost me 60.00 and now I just wasted the money.;Did not come with screws - Negative, unit not assembled - Neutative, cost 60.
Love this product. I needed a unit to organize a small area in my home. On a budget but needed it to be sturdy and attractive. This unit worked perfectly. So much so that I came back and purchased another one. Thank you for quality affordable products.;Organize small area - Positive, sturdy - Positive, attractive - Positive, quality - Positive, affordable - Positive.
Organizing Behemoth. I had a TaskRabbit person assemble this, but he did it quickly (an hour or less) and only needed my assistance holding it up to install the grounding hardware (err... walling hardware? whatever those pieces are to make sure a 200 pound shelf doesn't come crashing down on you). I meant to get the 4 x 4 one not the 5 x 5 one, but turns out I needed those 9 extra KALLAX cubes and that way I can decorate them them in fun ways too. I wish some of the inserts/organizers weren't so expensive, but the shelf as is, is a great value. I was surprised the parts fit in my Jeep Renegade and man it was difficult to get 66 lbs upstairs on my own (there are 4 boxes- 2 are 33 pounds, 2 are 66 pounds), but I did it. Now I want to replace an old book shelf I have with the 4 x 4 that can also double as a room divider.;Great value - Positive, heavy - neutral, required assistance for assembly - neutral.
Installation/Adjustment is a bit fiddly. Compared to to other IKEA furniture I've assembled, this one isn't quite as straightforward, and getting the door aligned so that it it is flush when closed is more difficult than I'd hoped.;Fiddly installation/adjustment - Neutral.
Bought two at the same time - one is heavier?. I bought two standard white 2x2 units during the after Christmas sale. Two boxes, stacked on top of one another. I had help loading and unloading my cart and vehicle, so I did not notice that one is marked 29lb and one is marked 42lb. Same item number, just a small 5 digit number to the side is one number off. I carried one box upstairs, assembled it, and then...could not pick up the second box. I'm not entirely sure what to do about this, or even what to think of it. I clicked through the different colors available on the website, and they, too, have inconsistent package weights listed at the time of writing this review, though none were as light as the 29lb model. Assembly of this lighter unit went about as well as expected, including the obligatory breaking of those little wooden dowels and having to scramble to find a suitable replacement in my collection of old baggies of extra Ikea hardware. I'm debating returning one or both units, and I will also be weighing my daughter's pink Kallax to see how those measure up. I guess the takeaway from this should be check the ENTIRE label, not just that the article numbers match up.;Two units bought - Neutral, one unit heavier - Neutral, assembly process - Neutral, unexpected weight difference - Negative, checking entire label - Neutral.

"Library shelves. In total, I have bought 3 of the 8-space units and 2 of the 4 space units. The 2 4 space units are stacked on 2 of the 8 space units for my library. Relatively easy to assemble. My only complaint was that 3 of the 5 units were missing 1 or 2 of the wooden dowels. I could have had some sent, but I was on a hurry to get this project done, so I cut up 5 1.7/8 pieces of 3/16 threaded steel rod I had, and used those. Worked fine! And they don't show.

Perfect for entry foyer console/storage. We use this shelf laid down horizontally on its side, as storage for our 4 kids bookbags, hats/gloves, etc at the house entry foyer and doubles as a console.

Great shelf but damaged. Love this shelf but when I opened the box one of the pieces was dented. I put it together since it wasn’t a huge dent but when I went to put the glass in it couldn’t lay flat because of the dent. Everything else was great but pretty disappointing as it was really perfect for my needs. The box showed no signs of damage and I live an hour from the store so just living with the dent.;Great shelf - Positive, Dented piece - Negative.
Great value. Easy assembly;Great value - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive.
Difficult to put together and didnt Include screws. I bought this about a month ago and out of the huge order I placed this was easily the most difficult product to put together. The boxes require that you beat on them (leaving dents) with a hammer to make sure you can get all four corners in and even then it is challenging. On top of that after we *finally* got the boxes together we starting putting the wall mounts on and found that they didn’t include the screws you need to mount it to the wall. Like what’s the point then? I had to go to Home Depot to buy the screws where I could have just bought everything I needed for the wall mount and ignored buying this from ikea. Honestly the worst experience I’ve ever had putting together ikea furniture, usually it takes 15-20 minutes it’s easy and it looks great but not this time. I would never buy this again;Difficult assembly - Negative, did not include screws - Negative.
So glad I made this purchase. I purchased 2 Kallax Shelves for my toy store. They look great and gave us the additional shelving needed for our merchandise. In retail, presentation is everything;Great looks - Positive, additional shelving - Positive, merchandise display - Positive.
Staple piece. Love these cubby shelfs. We own three and they all work fabulously in our home, no matter how we choose to use them. My only qualm with this item particular it was not clearly labeled on the box that this was “glossy” when we wanted matte. Also, by the time we open the box and pieces it would’ve been too much work to exchange so we kept it.;Cubby shelfs - Positive, works fantastically - Positive, glossy finish - Neutral.
Missing parts from a SEALED box. Always check parts before assembly! I've put so many pieces of furniture together I failed to do so. Got this 90% together before I realized the top was missing. Returned for a refund...too angry for a replacement!;Sealed box - Neutral, missing parts - Negative.

Not as tall as past shelf. The shelf is great. The only problem we had is that the height is different from the same shelf we bought several years ago. We made it work but there is definitely a difference.;Great shelf - Positive, different height - neutral.
A winner. Love this item. I use them everywhere. Tv consoles for my kids rooms, closet storage, and office storage!! This are so handy and the maximizes the storage space and also looks sleek.;Versatile - Positive, maximizes storage - Positive, looks sleek - Positive.
Works great, but consider it a permanent feature. I needed a couple of drawers for my keys and stuff that goes in my purse, these drawers work perfectly for that. Drawers fit great, no issues there. I just wish I didn't have to use screws to attach it to the main unit. If I ever remove this, there will be unsightly holes. Otherwise a great piece.;Works great - Positive, permanent attachment - Neutral, great fit for drawers - Positive.
Best budget bookshelves I've ever bought. I bought four of these two years ago, after a lifetime of buying inexpensive chipboard bookcases that sagged. I'm about to buy another one now that I have a bit more space. They are practical, very strong, easy to move (I just did that) and the shelves don't sag despite their long span. Really terrific for the price. I'm surprised they are not easier to find on the IKEA web site--I'd be promoting these heavily. Bonus: they are attractive white enamel.;Budget bookshelves - Positive, strong - Positive, long span - Positive, attractive white enamel - Positive, easy to move - Positive.

Sturdy and looks good. I was hesitant to buy after seeing other reviews of being hard to assemble or missing/broke parts but I'm glad I ignored that and bought it. All the parts were in the box and correct with no damage. It only took an hour to put together. Not sure what these other people are doing where it takes hours or days, but this was easy to put together. Well built, sturdy and looking good! Try it, you'll like it too;Well-built - Positive, sturdy - Positive, looks good - Positive.

lots of options. It is simple to put to together and they offer so many options to put in these cubicles. I put drawers and doors and some bins. Also bought a biggest 25 cubicle unit for another room. We were putting this one over a heater intake and I found legs on line that had adjustable heights from IKEA ! My husband did a couple things to it to make it earthquake proof instead of using their anti tip brackets because of the limited locations that the brackets had to go, they were not where the studs were but it's all good. A problem solver and the price is right! Love it! I just wish they make a 6 cubicle one, I have another problem area that needs this.;Many options - Positive, simple assembly - Positive, adjustable heights - Positive, earthquake proof - Neutral, wish for a 6 cubicle unit - Neutral.
So easy to assemble! Great looking storage.. I purchased this last month to place atop the Malm three drawer chest. We have two Malm six drawer pieces with two three drawer pieces on either side. I needed some thing for photos and decorative items but didn't want shelves. I got the dark brown and it looks good with the Malm dark brown. It was so easy to put together! Did it in record time, by myself. Considering another to place on a huge bathroom vanity for storage.;Easy to assemble - Positive, Great looking - Positive, dark brown - Positive, record time - Positive, considering another - Positive.
"Love the option. Should be redesigned. While it's great to be able to add doors for a relatively affordable amount (they quickly add up once you start put several in a kellax shelving unit!), the combination of the kellax not forming spaces of even and consistent size, will make adding these inserts a bit of a pain and very time consuming as they need a fair amount of tweaking. At times could get quite challenging depending on which position you need them installed as that would really make a difference since in some spots the kellax has inconsistent dimensions due to the structure not being as rigid as it 'd need to be for inserts to have a nearly perfect fit no matter where they're placed. Generally a re a good option and you can make it work well if you are resourceful when hitting a snag and have lots of patience which regardlessly is usually a chief requirement when assembling IKEA furniture to begin with. Just don't get upset or intimidated should something not fit perfectly... take a breath and a breath then think of the best solution to the misalignment, excessive gaps and do on... then get back to it and to try and see if what you thought about will fix the issue, most likely it will ;) If would be great to see these redesigned in a way which would not need so much tweaking, adding spacers, get different screws, adding adhesive sealing strips or padding where needed. Perhaps even get a cheap frosted plastic/lexan sheet swinging on a side tube that would act as a hinge where the top and bottom sides would have a shallow well to which the vertical plastic hinge would be anchored (just a thought) :)";Relatively affordable doors - Positive, inconistent sizes - Negative, challenging assembly - Neutiful, requires resourcefulness and patience - Neutral, could be redesigned - Neutral.

Looks great but what a pain to put together.. Love our new bookshelf but was not the easiest thing to put together. I had read the reviews prior to purchasing and took note to follow the instructions. Make note of every attachment placement in the instructions as the pins/attachments are in different locations.

It's super cute once it's all complete!;Looks great - Positive, pain to assemble - Negative, last piece is a pain - Negative.
Love having doors, drawers, and bins. I really like have doors on the upper row of shelves in our 2 units. It is an easier way to access the things I store in there.

Poor instructive sketches. The drawing was hard to understand given what was in the box.

Mixed feelings. I had to return the unit I bought since I decided I didn't have the time to hack the unit from 2 to 1 rows. There is no Ikea unit that is 1 row, 2 columns with drawers insert. Also, I was going to purchase a 3 row, 4 column unit with muliple drawer units for a media center.

Tons of space!. To start off, when they say multi-man lift in the instructions, they mean it. This thing is a beast. The unit assembled similarly to all other Kallax units (I've done the 2x2 and the 2x4 units also). The challenge for this one was manhandling the unit to get everything to slot in properly.  I will say since the unit is so big, there does seem to be a bit of flex or wiggle in the unit, but since you're pretty much going to bolt it to the wall, it doesn't really matter. The amount of flex isn't much, so most probably wouldn't notice. I did need to use a hammer and a piece of scrap wood to tap things flush multiple times, especially with the final end piece. All in all, if you've put other Kallax pieces together in the past, this one is no surprise other than the sheer weight of the unit.;Tons of space - Positive, Multi-man lift - Neutral, Assembled similarly - Neutral, Big unit - Neutral, Bit of flex - Neutral, Will bolt to wall - Neutional, Sheer weight - Neutral.

HORRIBLE TO ASSEMBLE. It's a beautiful piece of furniture, along with the whole collection But it was so hard to assemble. it took me 3 days. I'm not good at Ikea furniture,but out of the 3 pieces I bought, this was the hardest. Also, its not even fully assembled. the boards you place as shelving, come with screws to hold them in place...No clue how tiny screws are supposed to hold a thick board in place but okay...I don't know if I received wrong pieces, or the instructions were just confusing. It took 2 of us to attempt and a day later, it was still wrong so i went back the following 2 days to correct. It's still not assembled correctly, but it's sturdy.;Beautiful piece of furniture - Neutral, difficult to assemble - Negative, took 3 days - Negative.

Minimal, elegant design. A nice shelving unit that fits into a wide variety of decors. A friend commented that it looks more expensive than the actual cost. Once assembled, it does have a slight wobble but when its mounted against the wall, its very secure and won't budge. I use it to hold paperbacks and light hardcover books and there is little to no bowing of the shelves. For heavier hardcover art books, I would recommend the smaller Fjalkinge unit. The drawers are spacious and glide easily and I like that I can add more drawers or shelves in the future, if needed.

Revised review. I wrote a 1-star review that was strongly critical, in part, of what I regarded a near-impossible assembly requirements, noting that I have woodworking skills. Well, last night, after closely reviewing the assembly instructions over and over I realized that the assembly issues were my own fault. I still can't explain the issues with one of the three cabinets, but the issues with the other cabinet were because, when I assembled the cabinet, before the last piece was to be attached, I had (essentially) a C configuration, with piece 1 at the top of the C, where I should have had an upside down U configuration, with piece 1 at the top of the upside down U. I'm sure this makes no sense without the instructions. But what I can say is that, when I had the cabinet in the proper upside down U position, the last piece attached easily, without the problems I had been having. I therefore believe I caused the problem, and I caution anyone else building the cabinets to be very attentive to the specifics of the assembly instructions and to not attempt to attach the final piece unless and until the cabinet is in the proper upside down U position with piece 1 at the top of that upside down U.;Assembly instructions - Neutral, woodworking skills - Positive, had issues - Negative, proper upside down U position - Neutral.

This is not as simple as it looks. We have bought and constructed MANY Ikea products in different cities and countries and this one confounded us which only maddened us as it SEEMS so simple.

Makeshift Lingerie Dresser. Great price compared to similar products at other retailers and far sturdier than ones I've tested. Since they stopped making the Hemnes lingerie dresser, I needed something when we replaced out bedroom set. This is working as a great temporary fix with fabric bins. It is one of the easiest IKEA pieces to assemble and is a quick build. The veneer feels fragile and like any movement or touch will scratch it.

"Sturdy, minimal industrial look. The minimal, industrial look of this shelf unit doesn't look overbearing in my small apartment. The satin, slightly textured black finish of the metal is well done. The wood shelves are solid pine wood with a rustic looking stain. Once the feet are adjusted and the unit level with the floor, it becomes very sturdy even if you don't screw it into the wall (which I would do for safety, especially if you have kids or pets). Assembly of this unit can be tedious and took me about 3 hours to get together. For example, in step 6 of the assembly instructions, the hole at the middle vertical bar was tight and you might need to open it up a bit by turning the screw a few times before assembling the bottom shelf to it. Even then, you have little leeway to turn the screwdriver; go slowly so you don't strip the screw head. Also, for step 9, one of the small jutting bars of the side frame that connects to the bottom shelf was welded with a hair's width of misalignment. In order for the pieces to fit together, I had to nudge it by lightly tapping it using a hammer covered with a protective cap. You may need to touch up any screw heads with black marker or paint if you scraped off the finish with the screwdriver. What would make this look even better? A crossbar for the back might add extra sturdiness. The same goes for the sides; either a crossbar or mesh sheet similar to the bottom shelf could keep books from sliding out. Otherwise, a nice looking and inexpensive take on industrial shelving.";Minimal industrial look - Positive, sturdy - Positive, well-done finish - Positive, solid pine wood shelves - Positive, assembly process - neutral.

Difficult to assemble, cheap material. We are so disappointed with this shelf. We have purchased many other pieces from Ikea that appeared more difficult to assemble, but this shelf was by far the worst. We thought it would be a piece of cake but boy were we wrong. The pieces simply would not go together correctly, and the wood chipped away in places. We followed the directions and took our time, I swear our pieces had to be flawed. If our IKEA store wasn’t so far away, we would have definitely returned it. However, it is over an hour drive. Sadly we went to IKEA for this shelf (and lunch in the food court!) only. What a wasted day. The shelf was intended for organizing my daughter’s closet. We ended up assembling it without the back ( it was the only way we could get the pieces to fit together.). It is chipped in places which disappoints me. I felt it was a little pricey for IKEA to begin with, but the dimensions were spot on for our needs. I am very disappointed with how it all turned out though. I like IKEA shelves and storage just NOT this piece.;Difficult to assemble - Negative, cheap material - Negative, chipped wood - Negative.

Can’t believe these are extremely hard to assemble. Just as other reviews have stated, these cubes require a lot of force up to the point that you’re splitting the wood. I have bought 10 of these and every single side of each one was extremely hard to connect together. The first three sides were okay but once you put that back panel in... that fourth side will not go in at all! The holes are not drilled into properly making assembly such a difficult process.

Worst Design Ever!!!. Like some others, I registered just to write this review. This piece is the worst design of anything I've ever encountered at IKEA. I just bought two of them and have bene through an ordeal trying to get them to assemble properly. The first one required that I trim about an 1/8 inch off the back in order for the final side piece to fit in, but this was only after struggling mightily with it for a while and damaging the wood in the process. Two things have to happen at once for the last piece to fit in. The pegs have to line up, and the back piece has to be in the grooves of the other sides. This would require bending both time and space. On the second cabinet I snapped one of the shoddy plastic pegs with light pressure and then while the super glue to fix it was drying on that, I snapped 3 more pegs just trying to move the stupid thing out of the way. It's like they are made out of Derrick Rose's knees.  Just an awful design, a horrible experience, and makes me seriously question IKEA's (and Sweden's) commitment to quality. There are 4 stars reviews on here where they clearly say they had to leave the back off the cabinet. How can you give a 4 star review if there is a major piece that doesn't fit? That's insane. If I didn't want a back on it, I would have bought the Kallax.;Worst design - Negative, struggling with assembly - Negative, snap Pegs - Negative, commitment to quality - Neutral, horrible experience - Negative.

Exception proves the rule. I have 7 of the Kallax shelve in my home in different sizes, 3 in just the 57x57. I have LOVED these shelves as they have worked beautifuly, coming in different sizes and colours. The closest IKEA store is an hour and a half away so when I happened to pass by it on the end of my trip yesterday I just had to get another! The box it came in was pristine but on opening it to put it together one of the internal pieces was damaged with a deep dent bigger than a quarter and unable to hide if I put it together. After an hour on the phone with customer service due to the size a repacement piece can not be sent my only options are to drive the 1.5h to either swap out the shelf/whole box, to return it... Or to deal with it. So in short its generally a great product, but if you aren't near an IKEA you run the risk of having your day ruined by an eye-sore that makes the products statement looks great from any angle completely false.;Loved shelves - Positive, different sizes - Positive, customer service interaction - Negative.

Not hard if you can read and follow directions. We bought four of these for use by our children for toy and book storage. They are not difficult to put together if you read and follow the directions.

Quality is hit and miss. I bought 4 of these units. 3 were made of great material that will hold up well.

Good shelf unit to keep your house organized. We bought this to organize our clothes in the closet as it's much cheaper than anything else. Works perfectly fine for our purpose. The wood came with some small defects, which was really annoying, but we didn't botter to take it back and exchange the product. It's much stronger and more stable than the competitors' products (Walmart and Target), so I recommend it.;Organizes house - Positive, cheaper than alternatives - Positive, works fine - Neutral, small defects - Negative, stronger and more stable - Positive.

Great item, could be even better with minor tweaks. We bought this item to replace a bookshelf and a TV stand and were very pleased with the overall results. The TV on top is out of the way but still watchable for our little kids. The storage below with bins makes our living room look significantly more organized. Our bin storage ranges from kids' toys and DVD's to new tissue boxes and new paper towel rolls. We considered the 5 x 5, but are very happy with this option instead. It was also a bonus that assembly was simple. The only minor tweaks which would make this unit better: 1 Add a slight cut-in at the bottom for baseboards. Attaching to the wall for safety is cumbersome when it sticks out so far because of floor trim. Other units have such a cut-in to make things more home-friendly. 2. Add an optional, additional matching color, box-bin with a front cabinet door. It could latch in the back to stay stationary, but allow for more customization. Overall: Great shelf unit.;Great item - Positive, minor tweaks needed - Neutral, replacement for bookshelf and TV stand - Positive, kids safe - Positive, organized living room - Positive, simple assembly - Positive, slight cut-in for baseboards - Neutional, optional matching box-bin - Neutral.

The assembling is not as easy as other IKEA products. I have been a loyalty IKEA customer for decades and I had assembled at least 30+ IKEA furniture all by myself successfully until I met the KALLAX 5*5 Shelf unit. I am not sure if it is just me or the product that I received. It seems that all 4 side boards in my packages don't have holes deep enough to hold the wooden pegs. I tried everything to make it right, finally chose to drill the hole more deeper and hammered the pegs to make it shorter, and eventually the pieces were put together. However, there are still ugly gaps in both sides through which I can see some peg parts, plus there are bumps on the side boards now as I tried to hammer them together from the board sides. Very frustrating! AND the piece is too large to be taken apart for return.;Assembly difficulty - Negative, loyal IKEA customer - Neutral, fragments with shallow holes - Negative, unsatisfactory result - Negative.
Solid and easy to install. Bought 2 and it was super easy to install.;Solid - Positive, easy to install - Positive.
Very functional. I purchased a larger unit like this one 15 years ago, but it was called Expedit. That unit served me well so I searched the IKEA site and found Kallax. It seems this product has changed names. I use this unit to store my card making supplies. I even purchased a couple of the storage boxes that fit in the unit as well. I am always asked where I purchased it. I also fits in with any decor I have placed it in.

Great Unit. I bought this unit a month ago for my new apartment and I do like it. It is not as sturdy as I would like but it definitely works for me. Keeps all my clothing and items nice and organized and I use it instead of a dresser. It was a pain to put together though. I would have preferred some screws holding the shelves together instead of only dowels and including some extra dowels would be much appreciated.

Built our own wall unit. Love these! All of the multi-cube units were out of stock so we bought what was available and created our own 10 cube, wall-hung storage unit.

Know what you're getting into!. I installed the turquoise-gray doors on a gloss-white Kallx unit. I had read the installation instructions before purchasing and thought I knew what I was getting into, so learn from my mistake! First, plan your layout. Once these inserts go in, you do not want to move them somewhere else. You have to screw these into the sides of the Kallax cubes, which means putting holes in the finish. It will help (a lot) if you have a drill and bit handy to create a pilot hole. I also use paint tape to put the spacer guides on the shelf while I did the installation so that I could make sure the insert was properly aligned throughout. As previous reviewers mentioned, make sure you check the back page of the installation guide for instructions on how to adjust the hinges up, down, forward, and backwards for aligning the doors evenly. I found using a few thicknesses of cardboard to hold the door where I wanted it helped too. Installation of four doors took about an hour. And buying four doors in high-gloss paint cost me more than the entire 4x4 Kallax itself. Not entirely happy about that, but it looks good.;Installation instructions - neutral, Gloss-white Kallax unit - neutral, Requires Planning - neutral, Drill handy - neutral, Creating pilot holes - neutral, Checking back page of instructions - positive, Hinges adjustability - positive, Installing doors - neutral, High-gloss door purchase - negative.

Looks Like a Built-In. We bought two of the 4-cube units as a base and two 8-cube units to sit on top of those. Our builder made a wooden frame complete with pieces that covered the seams, and we painted it with glossy white to match. It now looks like a huge built-in shelving unit at a third of the price. We added drawers and doors to four of the bottom cubes, and a few of the other accessories to the top. It looks great! We painted the back wall to add a pop of color behind the shelves. Very happy with this solution. A few dings in the shelves, so not perfect, but we touched those up.

Wonderful storage. This is a wonderful piece of furniture for any sewing studio or craft room.   I use my Kallax units for storing fabrics wrapped around comic book boards.

Really looks nice!. This adds a lot of beauty to the KALLAX shelf unit. Upped its appearance, making it look like a higher end purchase, other than something I put together myself. WORD OF WARNING THOUGH...you need to screw these in place, so you will be putting holes in to your KALLAX unit...HOWEVER...I did not do that, in case I want to lay my unit differently down the line.

Roomy cubbies, simple assembly!. I put together my first two Kallax (2x4) shelves (all by myself!) in about 90 leisurely minutes. I'm pleased with the overall simplicity of assembly! I read in another review that a rubber mallet can come in handy for pushing together pieces. When I wasn't hammering, I just held the shelving with my hands and nudged it with my rubber-soled, non-marking combat boots...for me, this worked beautifully (and the shelf remained absolutely undamaged). All the parts fit together flawlessly. I assembled it atop a carpeted surface and would recommend this. The hardest part of the entire shelving experience was taking the boxes off the shelf at IKEA—because they were heavier than I'd expected—but the kind IKEA staff helped me put them on my cart, and another staff member helped me load them into my vehicle.

Problem Solver. We bought this to solve a space/table problem. Every table we have ever placed in our breakfast nook has been a bust. We needed something where we could stash grandkid's backpacks, colors and crafts, all sorts of things. With the boxes this organizes a lot of things that would take over kitchen junk drawers, got the kiddos projects off the dining room table, opened up a small space that is usually overwhelmed by standard dining tables. It was a great choice.;Solves space problem - Positive, organizes items - Positive, opens up space - Positive.

Exactly what I asked for.. I bought this for storage for a sewing/craft area in my basement. I bought the high-gloss white, which looks very classy. I decked it out with four sets of drawers and 4 doors (in high-gloss turquoise-gray) in the top two rows, opting to put fabric bins in the rest. The important thing to note is that the installation of the drawers and doors took longer than assembling the unit itself. Tons of storage nicely hidden now. Am thinking of putting a 2x4 Kallax on top for even more places to hide stuff. Buying on sale at Friends & Family pricing makes this even more attractive. This isn't museum quality, but it's sturdy, useful, and meets the price point for what I'm using it for.;Exactly what I asked for - Positive, high-gloss white - Positive, classy look - Positive, four sets of drawers - Neutral, installation took longer - Neutral, tons of storage - Positive, affordable - Positive, sturdy - Positive.

Buy it. Really.. Yes, I'm an idiot. I bought one of these and a tall Billy bookcase because I couldn't decide which was the better one to have. I'm really stupid. I should have bought 4 of these!

"Disappointing. They took me three times as long to finish than the unit itself! There's no written directions; just pictures. They expect you to screw through two layers of board and into the unit to set the doors.. With a screwdriver and an incredibly short screw. These will absolutely test your upper body force and strength. The knobs are a joke. They're tiny and have no grip to open with ease. I purchased them for functionality but, in my opinion, they play more of an aesthetic role. I ended up finishing but realized I had screwed in one for backwards. (it could have been fine but I wanted the knobs together). I made the decision to take the one side out and screw it back in on the other side. I physically couldn't do it. Trying to screw those little screws in through such thick layers took every ounce of energy out of me. My boyfriend tried finishing it for me and even he couldn't. We ended up having to glue it in.  Lastly, for a piece of wood, you're paying (assuming you bought two like the picture shows) almost as much for the unit itself. Crazy.  I don't recommend.";Disappointing - Negative, no written instructions - Neutative, took long to assemble - Negative, required significant force - Negative, tiny screws - Negative, poorly designed knobs - Negative.

I got burned buying these.... These are a really great product line. I plunged in head first and built my home office with a full set of these. (2) 5x5 units on the walls, 1 4x4 unit in the middle and another 4x2 unit against my near wall. But alas, I went with Birch and now it appears that Birch is discontinued so I'm left without any ability to get drawers, doors or accessories that match. What am I supposed to do? rip it all out and convert to white? black will make the whole office a black tomb. I'm really bummed. I like the design, and the accessories work really well, but if I can't buy more what the heck am I supposed to do?;Great product line - Positive, Birch finish - Neutative, discontinued - Negative, home office - Neutral.

Can't get enough of 'em.. We loved the industrial look of the Fjallbo, especially the fact that it uses real, solid wood. Very sturdy, but easy to build and light enough to move alone (when empty).

Very sturdy unit. I bought 2 of these for my extensive collection of LP's and 78's. The size is perfect for albums and I needed something that could hold the weight. This thing is very well constructed (although you have to assemble it). It went together like a champ, taking me about 20 minutes each. However there are 2 weights of these units when I bought mine and opted for the heavier one. If I remember correctly the price was the same for either weight. I am careful not to overload the shelves since vinyl records tend to be very heavy, but haven't had any problem whatsoever yet.

Handsome Industrial Style. Bought this about a month ago--so I can't yet speak to it's durability--but it is a very attractive addition to our home. It was pretty easy to put together, even for me (with chronic pain), but watch out for those little holes where the webbing adds a decorative touch. It is easy to put together backwards and have to start again. (I know from experience.) The shelves are quite spacious, and there's not a lot of structure to hold books or such on the shelf without assistance. I am currently using mine combined with dark stained wooden crates. The crates hold notebooks: the wood slats coordinate with the wood look on the top and disguise the not-so-pretty notebooks for a cohesive look.;Attractive addition - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, decorative holes - Neutral, spacious shelves - Positive, coordinating crates - Positive.

Pretty competitive price too.;Fits board games well - Positive, sturdy build - Positive, quick assembly - Positive, competitive price - Positive.
Bad design compared to older version. (note: this is a similar review I left on the drawers) If you ever purchased an older version of this you will hate this new version. You have to screw these into the shelving structure, so once they are there, they aren't moving unless you want to see all of the holes left behind. Being able to change how you used these in the old version was a great feature (especially if you move a lot). I am very disappointing in this new version. Quality is very low and it is not easy to install especially if you want the doors to be straight.;New version - Negative, bad design - Negative, quality is low - Negative.

love this shelf!!. This shelf is the perfect size, yet not heavy!! My disappointments: I wanted the walnut finish that evidently is a test color and there isn't a date to manufacture more. So I bought the light grey....but that color doesn't come in the half size of the shelf........So I can't have a tall shelf and a half size shelf that matches. The Ekert shelf light grey is a different color than the Kallax light grey......but all the whites match that IKEA makes.

Solid cabinet.. This cabinet is real Solid! The instructions recommended not to put the cabinet together with 1 person only, but I figure I try, and if it does not work, get help. I was able to get the whole deal together by myself, but getting it back upright after puttibg the corner felts on, was a real challenge and took all the strength I had , because the cabinet ends up to be real solid and heavy. Great buy though, and exactly what was discribed and what I needed.;Solid cabinet - Positive, heavy - Positive.

Quality has declined sharply. I bought the Kallax storage unit probably 6-8 years ago and bought a few inserts for it. Back then, while they were still the particleboard that's been laminated (and I bought it knowing that an not expecting high end furniture) it was at least sturdy and you could move it around from one hole in the frame to another, or you could flip it around so that it was a left opening door instead of a right opening one, for instance. It made it really convenient to change the purpose of the unit. I decided to put the unit in another room and change around the inserts, get a couple of more inserts with doors and one with a drawer. Now the inserts are super cheaply made out of something just north of cardboard that's been laminated and now you have to screw it into the base unit, which means you're putting holes in that and now you have lost the flexibility of changing how you're using the base unit. The only part if the same material as before is the door. Very disappointed, and will be returning it for a refund. IKEA has gone too far in cheapening their product.;Quality declined sharply - Negative, once sturdy unit - Positive, lost flexibility - Negative, cheaply made inserts - Negative, must be screwed into base unit - Negative.

Fairly easy to assemble. This shelf unit is very sturdy compared to a ladder type on returned to bed bath and beyond. That was impossible to assemble and the wood holes did not accept screws easily.

We have a house full!!!. We have purchased numerous kallax cubbies as we call them....we built a wall of kallax cubbies to use as storage for our clothes in the bedroom. Of course we used all the different inserts...the doors, the double drawers, and the various cloth and plastic baskets. We had to configure the units around something that was already mounted so we use all the different units altogether to make it fit....we routinely put legs on the bottom units that sit on the floor and it seems to enhance the look to make it look more like furniture in a home and not just a college set up.;House full - Neutral, numerous purchases - Neutar, storage for clothes - Positive, uses different inserts - Positive, enhanced look - Positive.

Nice!. My daughter loves this bookcase. It is the perfect color and looks very nice. The only issue that we had was when we were connecting the back piece to one shelf.

"New shelves are awful. We bought some for the office a couple of years ago and they were very good; sturdy and lovely finish for the price.

Looks great, Dimensions are hard to work with. Bought this in hopes of sliding it under a cube organizer and putting an xbox in it so we could store the controllers and such under it. The dimensions listed for the item are the dimensions at the widest parts of the length and width, so while the xbox did fit in the front of the tray, it only went about two inches before getting stuck since it tapers.

I was shocked at the literal holes in 3 sides of the box it was shipped in, with absolutely NOTHING between the shelves and the box. Seriously?? No packaging whatsoever? It would have come in better condition with packaging around it. VERY DISAPPOINTED!

Great shelf....for something other than books.. I bought this shelf a bout a month ago. It was fairly easy to put together and seemed packaged REALLY well to avoid dings and breakage. Had it assembled in less than 30 minutes and it’s as sturdy as can be. The levels on the legs were a nice touch since it’s on carpet and things seem to tip if they aren’t set down just right. The only downside is that it’s too tall to sub as an entry console and since the shelves aren’t adjustable....won’t hold average sized books upright without heavy bookends. since the middle shelf is glass, that doesn’t seem like the best idea for us. Would probably make a great bar cart/shelf or storage for extra pillows/throws....even in a DIY closet revamp as part of a “system”. Just wasn’t the right piece for us, so we are going to return it.;Easy assembly - Positive, sturdy - Positive, well-packaged - Positive, levels on legs - Positive, glass shelf - Neutral, not suitable for books - Negative, returned product - Neutional.
Easy assembly. Works great for storage in my sewing room.;Easy assembly - Positive, works great - Positive.
Useful but could be better. Pretty decent, but left a little to be desired. The main box and the drawer bottoms are flimsy cardboard, which doesn't matter as much since it's going in your shelves but is still a little disappointing. And the drawers are way shallower than I expected, about half the height of the front of the drawer you see when it's closed. And finally, when you're installing them, you have to screw them into your shelves, so it turns what I thought would be a modular design, one that I could move around or remove as I liked, into a semi-permanent addition, because if you take the drawers out, you're left with 4 big holes in the sides of the shelf where you installed it. So make sure you're happy with the slot you decide to put this in before you finish installing it.;Useful - Neutral, could be better - Negative, flimsy cardboard - Negative, shallow drawers - Negative, semi-permanent addition - Neutral.

Good product for some, not for all.. We have been using the kallax system since it was known as the (superior) expedit system. We needed a few new inserts. We saw the design change and opted to try them out. After reviewing the instructions before actually installing and then seeing the other reviews, I'm going to return this. The beauty of the original models was the ability to change the drawers with your needs. This new model requires for it to be permanently installed (or leave holes when you move the drawer). If you like versatility, pass on this. If you are ok with a permanent install, this should work for you but review other reviews around the challenges. I imagine Ikea is adapting design to reduce wood consumption,which should be applauded but something has been lost here.;New design - Neutral, permanently installed - Negative, lost versatility - Negative, Ikea's wood consumption reduction - Neutral.
Nice solid piece, multiple uses. I am currently working to convert a spare bedroom in my house into an office/craft/music room and I needed low profile storage for funky musical instruments. Once assembled, this product is solid. It is also light and easy to move around.  I feel as if I changed my mind about using the the shelf unit for storage, I could readily use it any place else for storage and it would not be out of place. The top is a nice high to stand and do a task on it and my only complaint is one of the doors is not fully aligned straight, but it is not so noticeable. (I think I notice it because I assembled it and tried switching the doors and parts to make it straighter.)   Depending on needs, I would recommend this for video games with additional shelving. It's a great height to sit or stand and play and the back of the cabinet is open for wires and what-not. It would also make a great sideboard for dishes or an aquarium, too.;Solid piece - Positive, multiple uses - Positive, easy to move - Positive, suitable for musical instruments - Positive, suitable for video games - Positive, open back - Positive, great height - Positive.

If taking more than 10 min, you're doing it wrong. And, I say that out of experience. By the last one, I was able to get the frame put together in under 5 minutes. Like others have noted, the directions have to be followed exactly. 1) Connect the top (#1) with one of the sides, 2) construct the T and snap it in place, 3) add the other side, 4) slide in the backing, and 5) insert the bottom (which has connectors like #1). After it's put together, secure everything in place with fasteners. No chips, broken pieces, or agony. I, too, was guilty of user error. The first one took way too long and with too much effort. I felt pretty silly when I was able to put together the last one so quickly. It really is all outlined in the pictures.;Easy assembly - Positive, quick assembly - Positive, clear instructions - Positive.

Looks good but can be frustrating to say the least. I bought two drawer and two door inserts. The drawers are a breeze and hard to mess up. The doors.. not so much. If your Kallax isnt perfectly straight it shows in the installation. I have an elevated 8 cube set up landscape with 6 legs and one door went on perfectly while the other was slanted. I usually love building IKEA furniture and don't mind decoding the instructions but the section on adjusting the doors after installation really needs more clarification. After fiddling with the screws for a while I finally got it looking straight but it's very unstable and not something that could be used frequently. Also keep in mind that you can't adjust screws in particleboard very much without stripping the hole. These inserts are better for people who aren't bothered by minor imperfections otherwise it's a toss up. Note: another reviewer said there is nothing to stop the door from going in but that's not true. The insert is designed to be its own door stop if you put it in right.;Drawers - Positive, doors - Neutral to negative, frustrating - negative, installation - neutral, imperfections - neutral, unstable - negative, adjustment instructions - negative.

Finally, a three column version of the Kallax!. We have used the two columns by four row Kallax shelf units for years and were excited when a three column by four row version became available. We added a few Kallax doors/drawer to the bottom row and a few baskets to the open cubbies. We like how the white shelves blend in with our white walls and are not a focal point to the space.;Three column version - Positive, Blend in with white walls - Positive, added doors/drawers - Neutral.
Loved it!. I bought this table to setve as a hall table in my foyer. I love the mix of metal with wood! Its industrial yet a little rustic looking which totally fits my style. My only qualm is that one of the cabinet drawers doesn't line up just right, and it seems to be a manufacturing issue. That issue is not a big deal, though because the door still seems to latch on to the magnet and close. I'm super happy with my purchase, and as usual can't wait for my next trip put to IKEA.;Industrial design - Positive, wood and metal mix - Positive, manufacturing issue - Neutral.
Kallax rocks!. I had two of the old Expedit shelves and have regretted leaving them behind when we moved 6 years ago. I just replaced my old loves with two Kallax units and I couldn’t be happier! I created a quasi-built-in look in our bonus room (with a 2X4 Kallax unit under the TV) and it looks so much neater, took care of my kids’ clutter. These are my absolute favorite IKEA pieces. Great quality at a very fair price.;Favorite IKEA pieces - Positive, great quality - Positive, fair price - Positive.
good idea. Very strange concept to make this insert our of what looks like sturdy cardboard since it has to screw into the sides of the hole.

These used to be made of wood not cardboard. I bought this one because IKEA no longer makes the large drawer version (Why not?!). Also on the subject of things IKEA doesn't make, why isn't there a propper half shelf for the KALLAX system? I'd buy at least 4 of those badboys, instead we have this weird shelf that sticks out halfway. Anywhoo, the older versions of these were made of wood so they were sturdier without any storage space sacrificed.

Another product is better. Surprised, but I would not recommend. We bought this one, for $5 less than the Better Homes and Garden identical looking product sold elsewhere. The other brand had already shipped to our house(for free), and we needed 1 more, so I went to Ikea and bought this one. My husband put them together at the same time and we were SHOCKED to see that the other brand was a better quality, sturdier installation method, etc. The $5 savings doesn't even come close to being worth it, and that's before factoring in the other one will deliver to your house.;Identical looking - Neutral, not sturdy - Negative, cheaper - Neutral.

Love the look!. I love the look the kallax brings to my living room. But I had abit of an issue with directions they were not detailed enough in explaining how to put this unit together. I had a mishap and lost one of the cube panels and the dowels that go with that one panel.;Love the look - Positive, detailed directions - Negative.
Directions unclear.

Great tv stand/storage shelf. I had my eyes set on a tv stand already but the second time I came back to purchase it my husband hated it and saw this shelf and said this would be great as our tv stand instead, I didn't even realize it could have be used as one. I'm glad he came and seen this because not only does it work out as a stand, the storage is great for all the kids toys, with the purchase of the storage boxes that are sold separately. The price is great as well.;Works as tv stand - Positive, great storage - Positive, reasonable price - Positive.
Shelves degraded in quality. I bought 4 of these Kallax units and although they have a great design the shelving material has been substantially changed. I had to return 2 sets because I ordered glossy white instead of flat white. I was surprised the replacement box for the flat white shelves was so much lighter than the glossy white and also lighter than my prior purchase of same Kallax u it in flat white.  Turns out all the shelves are not made of heavy mdf material but are hollow with a honey comb strengthening system on the interior. Not great for doing Kallax hacks with the material.  The shelves are essentially hollow with poor support inside.

I put together three pieces of ikea furniture this past week, and the other two were relatively simple, hour or two. This took like five hours.

Make sure you follow the directions carefully to make sure all the pieces are facing the right way.;Love this piece - Positive, no pre-drilled holes - Negative.
Inconsistent color. Bring back old design.. Nice gloss finish, but the white color is inconsistent between different lots/styles. I Purchased some doors and drawers at the same time and the doors are more off white than the drawers. I then went back within a years time to purchase two more drawers and those drawers are more of a pure white. Please do something to make the coloring more consistent. Please also bring back the old design where the door was a freestanding unit with thicker laminated wood sides instead of flimsy cardboard that must be screwed to the cabinet.

"Beautiful and Sturdy, But those dang wooden pegs!. The Kallax is absolutely beautiful. The shelf space is very generous, and the whole construction seems sturdy. The white colorway is a pure white, not cream-tinted at all. It makes for a beautiful book shelf, display shelf, or even room divider, since it is backless. The Drona boxes, shelves, etc. allow for a lot of storage and customization options as well.  BUT, the entire thing is held together with those little wooden pegs. There are 8 screws in the whole thing, at each of the outside corners. Everything else is wooden pegs. They are impossible to get in properly by yourself, and even with help, they are incredibly difficult. If your hands start turning red and hurting and you decide to break out the hammer, or try to hold it together and end up wobbling a piece, you may just break some of the pegs and be left wondering ""how am I going to finish this now."" Luckily, I did receive 2 extra pegs. However, that doesn't really help when the broken one is already stuck inside the shelf. So I had to break out the command poster strips and hold it together that way. Which seems to be working great, actually! I used 3 strips on each shelf connection that went pegless.  I do admit that breaking the pegs was my fault (and thus why I'm still giving this a 5 star review) but seriously, you're going to need assistance holding it all together until the final screws, and someone else's hands to rub raw from the wooden pegs after yours have taken all they can.";Beautiful design - Positive, sturdy construction - Positive, generous shelf space - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative, wooden pegs - Negative.
Worst bookcase every. I've gotten a lot of IKEA furniture and this the worst! I built it and as soon as I stood it up all the shelves fell and broke. The shelves are helped up by wood pieces that easily break. I want to return.;Worst bookcase - Negative, easy to break shelves - Negative, fell and broke - Negative.
Fantastic piece for an industrial look. The shelf is such a nice piece to look at in my new home, I’m so glad I was able to purchase it. It really goes well with my late grandpa’s steel worker figures. I also had some issues installing the doors, but what I did was screw the screws in little at a time and adjust the doors as needed before I screwed again. When I was putting this shelf together, I was working alone. As for not having a drill for the insertion of screws into the wooden planks, it’s incredibly easy to just press the screw into the wood where you want it to be and it’ll leave an imprint. It doesn’t require a lot of muscle, I don’t work out and have little lady arms. From there, hold the screw in place and press firmly with the screwdriver into the screw as you twist, just enough to keep it in place. I have a drill, didn’t use it. Start with the middle points, they have the best access points in terms of hand space.;Industrial look - Positive, Fantastic piece - Positive, had issuesinstalling doors - Neutral, wood screws - Neutral, little lady arms - Neutral, easy screw placement - Neutral.

Great addition to my den. My den is furnished with a lot of high-end items so I was concerned this wouldn't fit in with the quality of my items. I was wrong!

HORRIBLE!! Unsturdy. We purchased the Kallax storage cubes in the 3x4 cube variation and loved it so much we thought we should get another one just a little bigger. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! We chose the unit with 4x4 cubes and it is a heaping pile of junk. The outer boards are bowed and the inside pieces won’t even go together all the way so you can see the pegs between the shelves. It’s so unsteady they give you a special bracket to mount on the wall to keep it from wobbling but IT WONT EVEN GO ON 2 STUDS!;Unsturdy - Negative, bowed outer boards - Negative, won't go together all the way - Negative.

Where are the holes?!?. Love this piece for all the reasons stated in the other reviews (aesthetic, quality, strength, functionality, etc.). However, I had to wait 2 months to finish the piece until I could find a friend with the proper equipment to drill the holes to insert the wood screws. Why can't IKEA put pilot holes on this? It would make it so much easier!!;Love this piece - Positive, Quality - Positive, strength - Positive, lack of pilot holes - Negative.

Great idea. The idea of modules you can put in your shelving system is pure genius. These drawers work well and look good. With a tiny amount of thought they could have been designed to also provide structural rigidity to the shelf unit which would have really improved my impression of the overall system.; modules for shelving system - Positive, genius - Positive, good-looking drawers - Positive, could have provided structural rigidity - Neutral.

Smaller than unit bought previously. Same great quality as our previously purchased Kallax unit of the same configuration but about 1/2-1 inch smaller on the outer perimeter boards. As we bought this unit to stack it with our older Kallax units it matters but across the room it wouldn’t be very noticeable.  I admit that our older units are perhaps 10 or more years older and completely understand that IKEA can and should refresh and make updates to their products.  In our case I was not pleased to have missed the window for exactly matching our older units.  Having said that, I’d definitely recommend this unit as it is easy to assembly (especially when using a 9 yo helper), sturdy enough to hold a large number of books or other items and attractive. For the money, it’s a great addition to our household.;Smaller size - Neutral, same great quality - Positive, sturdy - Positive, attractive - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, holds items - Positive, missed matching older units - Negative.

Just what I needed. I have a narrow space between two closets and this fits perfectly.;Narrow space - Positive, fits perfectly - Positive.
Always versatile. I bought this along with the 2x2 and the 1x4 Kallax units. I have them stacked with 3x4 on the bottom (4 wide x 3 tall) the 2x2 next with the 1x4 on top as a bridge. This has left a 2x2 “hole” on the one side for my computer. I have dubbed it “The Monstrosity”. So far (three weeks of use) it has been great. I love the flexibility of being able to stack and configure the Kallax units to fit a variety of needs. The only reason I didn’t give them a 5 star rating is the lack of connecting hardware. Although hardware is included to mount the Kallax units to the wall to prevent them from falling over, no hardware is provided to connect stacked units together. This is really important in a configuration such as I have created to increase stability in the whole piece. Granted, it was a simple matter to purchase the appropriate brackets at the hardware store and drill the pilots holes myself, but still, it would be nice to have such hardware included with the units. I’m sure people besides myself also stack these units in unique and creative ways. Including the brackets would be the safe thing to do. Also, the door and drawer inserts are not the most sturdy of design nor the easiest to install.

Easy to put together. This is very similar to the old square storage shelf, but it's much easier to put together. This one is put together vertically, so you don't have to have a large empty room to assemble it. It seems about as sturdy as the old one. My one complaint is that the same colors aren't available - the other two square IKEA storage shelves I have are both a natural wood color, which is not available in this type.;Easy Assembly - Positive, Vertical configuration - Neutral, Seems sturdy - Positive, Unavailable natural wood color - Negative.

Difficult to Put Together. I bought this to use in my classroom for storage behind my desk. The directions for assembly are very confusing- I ended up putting pegs in the wrong holes and then was not able to get them out because they were so tight- the pegs are made out of wood and one ended up breaking. I have put together many bookshelves and shelves before and this was by far the most difficult one.;Confusing directions - Negative, difficult assembly - Negative.

Love it but hard to assemble. I bought this very functional cube a few months ago. Instead of hanging it I stacked 2 as an end table. Modern look. My only complaint is the very difficult assembly. You must connect the sides in order and then pound on it to get them together.;Functional cube - Positive, modern look - Positive, difficult assembly - Negative.
Missing piece. Bought this KALLAX shelving 3 weeks ago as I was moving and needs new nightstand. This was going to work perfectly. After the move I opened the box and began to assemble it. To my dismay, one of the boxes is missing a pretty important piece-the divider for the top shelf! I have tried calling for customer service but was never able to talk to a human and was hung up on by the automatic system. I attempted to do email as well but could never get through. So now I’m stuck with this piece of furniture that is obviously missing a main piece in the front. Disappointing.;Missing piece - Negative.

Bookcase perfection. I love these bookcases. They're elegant and yet simple. They offer seemingly infinite storage, and yet can be used as an airy room divider when placed behind the sofa. I alternate bright objects with empty spaces to keep an uncluttered look. I have also filled the bottom two levels with IKEA's cloth boxes to contain objects that don't need to be shown. Keeping books low on the shelves also helps weight them for stability.;Infinite storage - Positive, elegant - Positive, airy room divider - Positive, uncluttered look - Positive, stability - Positive.

Decent shelving unit but not great. I bought 2 of these kallax unit shelves and for most people whose handy, it may be easy to assemble. I on the other hand, had to manually use my own screwdriver with whatever physical power I had...which it wasn't easy. Paper instructions are sucky as they only show pictures and don't actually give you any additional details of what you're supposed to do. It's basically trail and error kind of thing. You either get it right or you don't. I've had to take it apart and start over because it wasn't the right side or end...and that's with following the directions. Also the wooden dowels can easily go into the holes too deep or break if you're not careful. Once you manage to put everything together, it's pretty sturdy. I don't know about everyone else but I am not kidding when I say that it took me about 4 1/2 hours for one and another hour for the other one. This review is not to scare anyone from buying the unit but it's my way of trying to inform purchasers so they can make a more informative decision. It's really a nice looking shelf once it's done but unfortunately I didn't have the luxury of paying IKEA to assemble it for me so I had to do it myself.;Decent shelving unit - Neutral, assembly - Negative, paper instructions - Negative, sturdy - Positive, nice looking - Positive.

uneasy feeling. It is beautiful, light, sturdy, but the corner hardware to attache it to the wall appears to be insufficient.

Great storage!. I bought the glossy white unit because I noticed it wears much better on the displays in the store. With a toddler and another on the way, I need my furniture to hold up to as much abuse as possible. The unit is pretty and easy to assemble. My only complaint is that one of the internal shelves was damaged during production. I thought I'd be able to hide it since it's an internal shelf so I put the whole thing together but it's still visible. I need to put a storage bin in that cubie so it doesn't show but really am unhappy every time I see. The unit is too big and heavy to bring back to the store to exchange.

My favorite insert so far!. I love this! I do a lot of vinyl work and these Kallax inserts are perfect. I'm able to sort my rolls of vinyl so much easier than before.

Good but needs quality control. I bought 2 of these shelves for my kids playroom to replace an older expedit shelf that we moved to my son's room. The first shelf had 2 different pieces that had defects in the outer veneer, if I had seen them before I started building it then I would have returned it but I did not want to deal wuth the hassel of dragging it in (w/ my 2 small kids)to exchange it. Was able to readjust so the defects were on one side and just put that against the wall. Was very disappointed to see these shelves went on sale a week after I bought them... I couldnt get to the store for a price adjustment in time. Also, one of the shelves had double dowel assembly and the other only had single dowels... just strange that they weren't consistent. But overall, love the design and ease of assembly of these shelves!;Good design - Positive, quality control issues - Negative, ease of assembly - Positive.

I searched all over to see images or get info on whether the backs of the inserts are the same as the front, so when you use it as a room divider it has the same finish on both sides. I had to go to the store and find a cabinet with inserts and pull it away from the wall to see what it looked like. The birch finish is birch --- so I assumed the glossy white would be glossy white -- and it is NOT! It is plain white melamine. So now it will look tacky to have the inserts facing both ways. Otherwise, I'm glad these inserts are available to make the cabinet look more sophisticated, just wish they had not failed on this detail.;Love the design - Positive, Back is not glossy white - Negative, room divider finish - Neutral.
Awesome bookcase/catchall. Always happy with the Kallax shelf unit  I have several and I love them;Awesome bookcase - Positive, catchall - Positive, love Kallax shelf unit - Positive.

Perfect fit. I love this adaptable piece of furniture. It sits beside my desk holding paper and other desk accessories.;Perfect fit - Positive, adaptable - Positive, holds desk accessories - Positive.
Long Time. Don’t get me wrong I love the shelf. But it was very hard to put together. As I hammered the shelf was falling a part. Once I stared using a rubber pad in between the wood and the hammer it was much easier to put together. But at the very top I would change the directions. To stand it up then finish putting it together.;Product is hard to assemble - Negative, rubber pad made assembly easier - Positive.
Great for closets. We bought six of these units over the past couple of months to customize our closets. Great in the master walk-ins for folded jeans, sweaters and tee shirts, in the guest room closet for towels and linens, and in my office/craft room for fabric, yarn, and files. They look great and keep things organized.;Great for closets - Positive, keep things organized - Positive, customizable - Positive.

Arguably the Best Shelving System for Vinyl. I bought two of these 2 x 4 Kallax shelving units, as well as an additional 2 x 2 Kallax unit and 10 matching Door Inserts for my record collection. I spent a LONG time researching these shelves: how many records they could hold without risking ring wear, if records would fit inside the Door Inserts (they do), etc., before pulling the trigger, but am so glad I did.  They look amazing in my study, and the shelves themselves show no signs of bowing under the weight of the vinyl. Finish is a rich, almost-black brown, and easy to wipe clean. Very sturdy, and relatively easy to assemble - it took longer to install the Door Inserts I purchased separately than it did to install the shelves. A very versatile, quality product that gives you peace of mind knowing your collection is well-housed. Definitely recommend.;Best shelving system for vinyl - Positive, holds records well - Positive, easy to wipe finish - Positive, sturdy construction - Positive, relatively easy to assemble - Positive.

Not as hard as others advise.

Looks great!. Kallax holds a lot of miscellaneous things in the living room and keeps them neat. I have two at my office at work and two at home. I love how the Branas (and other) boxes are made to fit in the little spaces of Kallax for hiding the things that don't need to be out in view.;Looks great - Positive, holds miscellaneous things - Positive, neat - Positive, fits Branas - Positive.

Great value. I have now purchased 5 of these for cubbies for our camp program. They are sturdy and easy to put together. The biggest challenge is getting the plastic protective coating off the edges so that's why I gave them 4 stars. For some of them I have just left it on since I can't get it off. Any tips?;Great value - Positive, sturdy - Positive, easy to put together - Positive, plastic protective coating - Neutral.

Perfect!!;Wide and low shelves - Positive, can be filled with books, baskets or toys - Positive, can be stacked or hung - Positive, grow with children - Positive.
would love deeper drawers. I love the drawer options for the KALLAX units and have 9 sets between 4 KALLAX units. They were easy to put together and install.

Easy assembly. Living in NYC kitchens come in small or x-small, this unit and a new kitchen table bumped us up to small;Easy assembly - Positive, bumped up to small - Neutral.
KALLAX for my crafts. This piece solved the problem for storing craft materials, especially yarn. Six Drona “bins” are in use, four with various yarns, sorted by weight/type. Two spaces were left open for decorative purposes. This is a great addition to my “office,” which had previously been a nursery/office.  Assembly instructions might have been better if they advised using a soft headed mallet, not a hammer, or perhaps suggest use of a board to protect the piece when pounding it together.;"Product solved storage problem - Positive, for craft materials - Positive, six ""bins"" in use - Neutral, great addition to workspace - Positive, clear assembly instructions - Neutral."
Easy to put together because of precious build. I have three different sizes in the Kallax Shelf units. This one was for my sister who has a mini-kitchen and needed more storage.

Nice design and finish, Poor construction. The large 4 x 4 kallax shelf unit is only held together with wood dowels and long screws that go into particle board... so it wobbles sideways a bit. It doesn't have the metal and screw attachments that many other Ikea furniture has. I want to use it as a room divider so the end must be anchored to a wall so it doesn't collapse under the weight of the contents. A lot of storage space for the price, and it has a nice clean design. Requires at least 2 people to assemble.;Nice design - Positive, poor construction - Negative, wobbles sideways - Negative, clean design - Neutral, large shelving unit - Neutral, anchored to wall - Neutral, lot of storage space - Positive.

Perfect!. I have a slide in closet and I have so many clothes and not enough room to put it I could not find a way to keep my clothes organized properly so I change my doors to bifold so I can see my whole wardrobe. Then I’ll put the shelf inside. The measurements are EXACT. I was hoping it would be slightly smaller like one of the comments said but yes it was exact size so I had a little bit of trouble putting it into the closet but when I got it in omg. My stuff has been so organized since no more mess or digging through boxes to find my clothes. I love that I’m able to now stuck my clothes in the bins and have each individual been separate for clothes. It’s also worth the money because My friend suggested to just buy individual squares and put my bins in but they’re normally around $20 each and if I got 8 of them you would be paying over $180 easily that way. But this only $69 and with bins it was like $110. I also love that I can customize this into cabinets or doors later on if I wanted to.;Exact measurements - Positive, Organization - Positive, Customizable - Positive, Good value - Positive.

Awesome storage unit!. Bought this unit for toy storage. I was a bit frustrated when I brought it home to find that we were missing a small piece ( a small wooden dowel). We couldn’t finish the unit without it and seeing as we live 30-40mins away I wasn’t about to drive back to our nearest IKEA. I’m also nesting so I didn’t want to wait for the piece to arrive in the mail, I just needed to finish it ASAP. Luckily we were able to find a replacement piece at our local ACE hardware store. I also noticed a small chip in one of the boards, it’s not very noticeable unless you know it’s there. Otherwise its light and sturdy and very easy to put together, I put it together with my 2 year old around and I’m 26 weeks pregnant. I’d purchase it again.;Awesome storage unit - Positive, bought for toy storage - Neutral, missing small piece - Negative, found replacement - Positive, light and sturdy - Positive, easy to put together - Positive.

Came together well. I have had this shelf for a month now and it's holding up fine.

Easy to put together, multiple uses. I've purchased so many IKEA Kallax units I can put the 2x4 unit together in my sleep. They're multi-functional and come in so many different colors.

used to be good. This was our third Kallax unit to buy - we liked the first two and with a move to a new house, we thought one more would fit just fine. And it did. But. This time the quality was not as good as before. One of the edges wasn't glued properly and was afar from the body right out of the box. I don't know how to avoid this. I definitely won't take the unit apart and drive it back to the IKEA store another 50 miles just to replace the defective part. But it's not even an option to open the box and check all the parts in the store... So... The product is fine but just be prepared for lowering quality.

Looks Decent Practical, but NOT Easy as Expected. I bought it about a month ago. Had it delivered through a 3rd-party delivery service. I assembled it with the help of my wife. Assembly wasn't as easy as I expected, not because the instructions were complicated, but because this piece is quite heavy to handle. My recommendation is to secure 3 people to do it.

Customize the Kallas. I have an 8-square black-brown Kallax unit, and filled the top row with 4 of these to conceal our book collection. The bottom row has Branas baskets for toys.

So Many Options. I love the glossy white finish I chose, as well as the many options available to customize the unit. Right now I am using it with all open cubbies but I've started a list for additional parts to make it exactly what I need. The only down side was assembly. It wasn't bad, and I have assembled many many products over the years, but until I was about 1/4 of the way through, I did chip the finish off some of the shelves (caused by trying to squeeze dowels into some very tight holes). It was minor, but still annoying.

KALLAX are the best bookcases ever. The book case is a complete success. I marvel at the packing and packaging, all those pieces in 2 flat but long boxes. My daughter and I got them home and into the garage. We are rather elderly so my husband opened the boxes and took the pieces downstairs where we wanted the book case placed. Once all the pieces were downstairs, putting the book case together was just a matter of screws and pegs. It all fit together marvelously and I asked 2 nice construction worker from the next door remodel to come set it upright and put it against the wall.

screw holes strip easily. This metal unit looks great and is a great size, but for $130 it should have a better way to enjoy the unit can be put together properly (and Ideally taken about without being ruined). But there is nothing to protect the screw holes, so if the screw goes in a little bit the wrong way most likely you'll strip the metal where the screw goes and it's ruined.

I also bought the drawer inserts. They’re awesome! We now have 10 drawers and no longer have clutter aka school papers and bills etc on the kitchen counters.

50% chance of breaking immediately. I bought 4 of these this week, and 2 broke extremely easily while putting them together. I went back to get replacements today, and one of the new ones broke in the exact same place as the others.

Requires drilling 6 screws into hard wood dividers. They look fine, but installing them in any position that isn't against one of the hollow-core sides is a huge pain.

"I made a bar out of it: it's sturdy, easy to clean. I would highly recommend this shelf! I like this one so much, for the unusual purpose I use it, I am getting several more Kallax. We are going to make more room in our humble abode by going more vertical with shelving. We are going to buy several larger, taller shelves, of varying sizes, for different spots in the house. I know they will hold up! Several years ago, I was shopping alone at an Ikea. I had driven, for a different reason, a few hours from home to a city that had a store; I decided to spend my evening at Ikea (the meatballs called me). We had been considering adding a small counter near the dining table, in our kitchen-dining area. Brainstorming about what we might need for the house, I recalled the counter idea. I looked at several items, but I thought this Kallax shelf (in white) could be the right fit as a modest bar counter with storage. It worked out just as I had hoped! I placed this along the wall of our kitchen-dining area, under a window, opposite all of the kitchen counters. It fit below the window sill perfectly. Since I don't keep much liquor around, there would be room to store other things. So, to store whatever we wanted, without having to look at it, I included a few seagrass baskets (the Knipsa). While it's a nontraditional use, as a simple bar, this shelf has worked out very well! We have had it for about three years now. It is very easy to clean, and at 13 inches and change, each shelf is large enough to hold every alcohol bottle we've had, except some artful, tall wine bottles. The shelves are very sturdy, and the top is fine for preparing a drink, keeping mixing sticks and shot glasses, drinking glasses, and a bit of decor. It's almost the height of most tables, so it works out really well as a counter, instead of a mere shelf.";Sturdy - Positive, easy to clean - Positive, highly recommend - Positive, unusual purpose - Neutral, large shelves - Positive, long-lasting - Positive, non-traditional use - Neutral.

Great Shelving For Organizing Just About Anything!. We love these Kallax unit shelves very much and have them in different areas in our house serving different functions. The main one we use the most is a set up of a 2x4 side by side with a 4x4 with a 1x4 across the top of those, and we use them to store our boardgames. The white looks really sharp and makes the board game covers pop. We also have a 2x4 in my daughter's play area and two additional 2x4's in a large storage closet to help keep everything orgainzed. The cubbies are the perfect size in my opinion.;Great shelving - Positive, Organizes objects - Positive, Different areas in house - Neutral, Set up varies in size - Neutative, Sharp white look - Positive, Boards games covers pop - Positive, Perfect cubbies size - Positive.

Looks great but.... Looks great when done, but found out when I was done building it and going to put in a door that one of the sides was on backwards. Can't tell otherwise. However that meant removing the felt pad stickers. The glue on them is so strong that when trying to remove them it peels off the black surface material so once on you can't decide later you want the unit horizontal instead of vertical because you can't take off the pads.;Looks great - Positive, reversible - Negative, strong adhesive - Neutral.

Great shelf, but not built the way they used to be. Let me start off by saying that when we picked up this shelf at the store, it was well packaged, not damaged, easy to put together and is exactly as pictured with the white one we chose and the cube spaces fit 13x13 organizers perfect. We have always been happy with Ikea products, but found this experience to be a bit disheartening due to quality/durability. We have an identical Kallax shelf that is 7 years old in the black-brown color and the quality (very durable), weight (very solid) and size are DEFINITELY different from the new. At the time we paid $79.99.    With the new one,(we paid $68.99) we noticed the thick edges are almost an inch less on each side compared to the one we have and with that it also makes it about an inch shorter. We thought the cost difference was Ikea's lowering of their prices to a Member's type price like they do on certain products but everything about it remains the same. In this case, the quality changed, but appearance remained.   Had I never owned a Kallax shelf, I would not have noticed this, but we do in this situation. I think this is a great piece for a low traffic area, but with the current materials they used, I wouldn't highly recommend it with high traffic use. The material also doesn't seem as durable, but only time will tell. With the material they used and building it using less overall materials, it also comes with a lesser weight and it just doesn't seem as solid. Although the new one looks great, the overall quality has changed.     This experience hasn't at all deterred us from wanting to go back to Ikea again because we love the store. But, I know that had I known the quality and weight would be so different, I may have looked elsewhere. I hope this helps someone! :);Well packaged - Positive, easy to put together - Positive, as pictured - Positive, quality (used to be) - Neutral, durability (used to be) - Neutral, size (used to be) - Neutral, cost difference - Neutral, appearance - Positive, current materials - Negative, overall

Wood pegs don't fit holes. I was expecting these to be more sturdy looking at the pictures. It turns out almost the entire thing is held together with round wooden pegs! Worst of all, those pegs don't fit the holes they are made for properly. Trying to push the shelves onto the wooden pegs doesn't work and if you use a tool to try and get the shelf in further the cheap fake wood dents and the veneer cracks. I recommend you spend your money on a higher quality piece of furniture...;Round wooden pegs - Negative, don't fit holes - Negative, not sturdy looking - Negative, veneer cracks - Negative.

Ridiculously Hard to Assemble. I bought 3 of these cubes for my daughter's room. The first one was difficult to assemble, but we were able to assemble. The other two will probably be going back to the store. Just as other reviewers have stated, we got 3 of the sides on but the fourth side will not click on. Something doesn't fit together correctly.

Packed Incorrectly. I have purchased this and IKEA made the mistake of packaging duplicate side frames. They did not pack the left and right but instead gave me two left. DO NOT BUY THIS.

Great unit!. I had looked at it on the website since Christmas. When I got to the store I found it a little “loose” and I was concerned that it wouldn’t be sturdy enough. Because of the return policy I decided to take a chance. I’m glad I did! It is the perfect piece to start revamping a spare room into my sewing/craft room!

"Strong, simple, useful. The FJÄLKINGE unit was super-easy to assemble, and holds a ton of books and standing-file boxes.

Waste of money, no matter how small the price. Dowels actually break through the shelves during installation.

Just LOVE it!. Let me be frank. I hate IKEA. But I love this furniture line. I fell in love with it in the store and the love only grew once I got it in my house. The pieces go together well, it has all the pieces I need, seems sturdy, and is priced very appropriately. Time will tell how the wood holds up, if it warps, cracks, etc. But for now, I couldn't be happier. Note to IKEA: you should either pre-drill the holes in the wood, or supply a punch tool. This is the only part that is VERY iffy in the assembly process, and the wood did split (underside only, for now) on one of the shelves. Should not need to be afraid that one screw could ruin the whole piece.;Fell in love - Positive, pieces go together well - Positive, seems sturdy - Positive, appropriately priced - Positive, iffy assembly process - Neutral, split wood - Neutral.

Used to be a good product. I bought one of these five years ago and it has been sturdy and functional. I just purchased another one and sadly they have taken a good product and made it bad.

Attractive, precise and useful storage.. I seriously don't understand how people found this difficult to put together. This was one of the *easiest* Ikea products I have ever put together, and I've done expedit, dressers, shelves, etc. This is ridiculously simple and for having pretty much no metal hardware is exceptionally precise in the way it goes together. For someone who is particular about details, symmetry and things being square and level, I was super impressed with the way this went together (bought the base for this and that was also simple and well engineered).

Looks great. We bought this to use as our bar, and it looks great in our dining room. It gives us a lot more space and the cabinet at the bottom means our bottles don't need to be on display.

Piece of Cake. I went in thinking assembly was going to be a nightmare, a lot of folks seem to express that in the reviews! But it was hyper easy.

Fine but..... If you are hoping to use it in combination with an older Kallax style piece, don’t. The size and coloration are different. New one is slightly smaller and more white.

Love the shelf unit, but those inserts?!. I bought the 4x4 Kallax shelf unit to use in my craft room. I absolutely love it. It was easy to assemble by myself, and it fits perfectly in the space I needed it for. I decided to get 2 door inserts and 2 2-drawer inserts, figuring I'd be able to place them wherever and change whenever...ummm, no. Beware, if you decide to go with inserts, you have to screw them in to the sides of the cube you want it in. This will leave you with some ugly holes if you decide to rearrange the placement down the road. I thought I was buying simple inserts that could slide in to the spot, not making a permanent decision that would affect the aesthetic of the shelf unit itself.;Love the shelf unit - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, permanent inserts - Negative, ugly holes - Negative.

Good & Not so Good. Love the unit. I have a few, but the 2 I just bought came with inadequate screws.

Great shelf... once it's all put together. This shelf is great... now that we have it up. Putting it up was so difficult. You really have to follow the directions closely, which is fine, but the last piece (the back piece) didn't fit at all.

SO frustrating!;Difficult assembly - Negative, great shelf - Positive.
Nice addition to my Kallax unit. This insert took my Kallax unit to the next level. I'm not one to read instructions, so it took me a little longer than I'm sure it was supposed to.

Clean Lines. I like the look and simplicity of the Kallex shelf. I have one that I bought about 6 years ago. It looks more expensive and sturdier than this newer model.

Wire shelf. A bit on the expensive side. I love that they hook in the back to the shelf so my kids can't pull them off. And I like that they utilize the whole width and depth of the Kallax units.

. I love how much I can organize.;Organize a lot - Positive.
Very nice design.. Sturdy. Two dowel holes were not properly drilled. Went up ok without them.

Stylish Shelf. I love the look of this shelf--rustic/industrial. My teenage son chose it for his bedroom. It seems stable (but not heavy) and can hold a lot. It added a bit of style to his minimalistic room. It wasn't too hard to assemble, but be sure to pay attention to how to orient the pieces.

Wonderful shelf but you will need a buddy to help. This is a pretty solid shelf unit. We are using ours as a room divider on carpet and it's not wobbly at all. I really love how deep the individual cubbies are too. One thing to note is that if you want to use the fabric cubes, you will need ones that are deep (or just leave a gap in the back). I made a happy mistake buying pretty ones that were exactly the height and depth I needed. Also, you will need a buddy to build this. I tried to build it by myself and there is no way. You will need someone to brace the shelf and someone to push the shelf. Trust me...this will make building it faster and easier. Overall, it's a wonderful shelf for whatever you need it for.;Solid shelf - Positive, deep cubbies - Positive, stable on carpet - Positive, requires assistance to assemble - Neutral.

Super storage!. I love this piece so much, I bought a second one. It’s attractive, super functional and a fantastic deal! It’s huge BUT easy to put together.

In my extra room I use Ikea containers in 20 of the squares to store everything from games to craft stuff to office supplies. Everything is tidy and labeled.

door hangs open. I bought this last weekend for organization in my Harry Potter decorated office. I installed it step by step the same day. For some reason, and maybe yes I should've used an electric screw driver, but my door will not close all the way and hangs open. I had a hard time screwing and securing the insert into the side of the Kallax bookshelf.; door doesn't close - Negative, installed the same day - Neutral, had a hard time securing - Neutral.
Great storage!. I already had two 8 cubes and decided to add more storage in my sewing room by purchasing 2 9 cubes and 2 more 8 cubes. They were easy to put together and look really nice.

Perfect for toys. Worked perfectly as toy storage. Great priced product. But disappointment that the night glass cracked in a few places whilst hammering in the dowels. Didn’t happen with my previous 3 expedit bookcases. Had to use a thick towel over the wood before hammering to stop this;Toys storage - Positive, great priced product - Positive, glass cracked - Negative.

(((NiCe))). I put this up myself. I only need help to turn it over to put in the other screws. i haven't decorated my living room in about 10 years. This 9 cube shelf comes in very handy... As I am becoming a little more of a minimalist. This item looks so nice in my living room after I placed 4 black drona boxes on the shelf. It looks so nice.;Nice - Positive, 9 cube shelf - Positive, handy - Positive, looks nice - Positive.
This is a great purchase. We got this after discussing how we wanted to organize a bunch of equipment we had. We had seen other versions of this shelf, but were immediately struck by the versatility, and we weren't 100% what way we wanted this facing. We LOVED that the basket choices were many and that they really filled the slot up. It is solid and surprisingly easy to set up (we have had some other furniture set ups that definitely were NOT simple). It looks great in our spot, and now we are considering adding another, smaller unit next to it for even more space.;Great purchase - Positive, versatility - Positive, many basket choices - Positive, easy setup - Positive, solid - Positive.

Wonderful TV Stand. My husband and I recently moved into our first home and wanted a functional TV stand. We are both gamers which means we needed plenty of storage for our consoles, controllers and games. It was very easy to put together and the materials were very sturdy. It makes our living room pop! We love it and would recommend to those looking for a different type of TV stand.;Functional TV stand - Positive, Plenty of storage - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive, Sturdy materials - Positive, Pops living room - Positive.
. The shelf unit fit perfectly in the space;Perfect fit - Positive.
Pretty good but wish it was made better. I bought this to use temporarily as a TV stand and later will use to divide a shared kids bedroom. I like it and overall am happy with it, but giving 3 stars because one of the last screws to hold together would not catch on the treads in the particle board, so it’s just sticking out and won’t screw in all the way.;Temporary use - Neutral, used as TV stand - Neutral, divide kids room - Neutral, overall happy - Positive, screw issue - Negative.
Very Versatile. I like this shelf unit because it looks good, can be used as a bookcase, disiplay cabinet, or room divider, and can be used with a desk or other shelf units.

. This works great in our master bedroom as a TV stand. Looks stylish and functional. Only complaint I have is that during install, we found two of the screw spots weren't drilled all the way through which meant we had to drill then ourselves. Not a big detractor but definitely a set back.;Stylish and functional - Positive, two un-drilled screw spots - Neutral.
Kallax is our favorite. We bought a set of Kallax cubbie-shelves for my mother, who recently moved into a very tiny apartment. The shelves solved her storage-shortage problem.

Sturdy and versatile. My husband and I have bought 3 of these now, two for our closet and one for our son’s bedroom.

Fjallbo Shelf Unit is great for potted plants.. I use this shelf for my plant collection. I like that the mesh shelves allow for air ventilation and light to travel through. Putting it together is not hard. You will need a Phillips screwdriver and a little bit of patience to line things up. The very top shelf is solid wood without any pre-drilled holes. I was surprised because most of IKEA's products have all the holes ready for you. I like that it doesn't have any particle board and feels solid but lightweight enough for one person to move around.;Great for potted plants - Positive, Mesh shelves - Positive, Air ventilation - Positive, Lightweight - Positive, Lines up easily - Neutral, Solid wood top shelf - Positive.

My fourth KALLAX. KALLAX is an icon. I bought this one to store my record collection. I have others with drawer bins and doors for storage. The fact that you can buy copies at Target and Walmart shows what a great idea it is...;Iconic design - Positive, stores record collection - Positive, available at Target and Walmart - Neutral.
Handy size, just wish it came in better colors. The cubby size is perfect and the height and width of the unit makes it very versatile. I only wish it could be offered in styles and colors that match other IKEA lines, such as BESTA and BILLY. We wanted to match ours with Black-Brown BILLY, so will likely end up painting it.;Handy size - Positive, versatile - Positive, could come in better colors - Negative.

I want to love them. I actually do like these drawers. I was very disappointed in the quality of them though. One set (I bought 5) the edging completely came off. I didn’t check the boxes apparently when I bought them and the box looked like someone tried to bend it. So my recommendation is to check your boxes!!;Drawers - Neutral, liked - Positive, quality issues - Negative, edging came off - Negative.
Great Cheap Storage. This storage unit was bought for storage in my tween’s bedroom. It took about an hour for my husband and myself to put together.

Great Product. We was looking for this bookcase that was very strong.;Strong bookcase - Positive, great product - Positive.
"Disappointed. I have the same shelving unit from a few years ago that I love; very solid and on wheels. I wanted a second unit to organize my crafting supplies... it is significantly thinner and less sturdy. IKEA doesn’t even sell the wheels! I wish IKEA would go back to the original design.

We are happy with how it looks and his stuff is hidden!;Perfect size - Positive, top drawers on rollers - Positive, bottom doors - Positive, took a while to assemble - Neutral, looks good - Positive.
Best Improvement Ever. Whoever dreamt up these drawer inserts deserves a raise! LOVE THEM. They add a whole world of organizing possibilities and really make the KALLAX units multi-functional. *Tip: add a bit of wood glue when putting the side rails on the drawers. If you've owned IKEA items with drawers before, you know that the rails can sometimes come loose or break. Adding the wood glue provides extra stability and they handle weight much better.;Drawer inserts - Positive, multi-functional - Positive, add organization - Positive, sturdy with wood glue - Positive.
Easy to assemble, sturdy, and looks great!. My husband had no trouble assembling the bookcase (which cannot be said for several other IKEA items we've purchased that were more difficult). It is very sturdy and looks fantastic (soooo much nicer than particle-board bookcases we have bought in the past). We chose to use it horizontally as a toy cubbie for our son, and we bought the corresponding DRÖNA boxes/bins.;Easy assembly - Positive, sturdy - Positive, looks great - Positive.
Perfect fit. I traded out my traditional dresser for this unit and I couldn't be happier. Fits wonderfully in the space and makes the room look larger!;Perfect fit - Positive, fits wonderfully - Positive, makes room look larger - Positive.
Hate the exposed screws. Like the shelf unit, it was easy to assemble. I don’t understand why the screws are exposed on the top. I’m using this more for decoration than hard core storage so maybe that’s why it bothered me enough to write a review.;Easy to assemble - Positive, exposed screws - Negative.
Ok. Harder to put together than anticipated, the instructions aren't very clear. They also don't hold as much as I wanted, the shelves are either too big for one item or too small when you try to double up on items. Bit odd;Harder to put together than anticipated - Negative, instructions not clear - Negative, hold less than anticipated - Negative.
Perfect. I bought this after thinking about it for a while. I'm so happy I took the leap. It's perfect, easy to put together and easy to clean.;Perfect - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, easy to clean - Positive.
Classy organizer. I was drawn to the gold color and the interesting structure of this organizational item. I didn’t realize it is designed for a specific shelf, which i do not have, so I am not sure how well it will be utilized in my home but I am trying to come up with a creative solution. I hope sometimes similar releases soon that can be for any shelf.;Classy organizer - Positive, gold color - Positive, interesting structure - Positive, designed for specific shelf - Neutral.
Broke 2 trying to put them together. Like someone else on this thread, I registered just so that I could warn you about this unbelievably frustrating product. There are no normal screws or the usual IKEA dowels on this. Instead, you must line up some very poorly cut holes with these plastic widgets and then force them down into the narrower part of the hole. But if you use any force whatsoever to get them to line up, the plastic wedges snap -- and there is no other way to put them together. I bought three and broke two in a row. I'm not even going to try the third. I'm returning all three tomorrow. For context, I've assembled at least a dozen other IKEA pieces in the past, and I've got 2 Master's degrees. Not sure what sort of training you need to put these EKET cubes together, but I don't have it. I cannot recommend against this product strongly enough.;Frustrating product - Negative, no normal screws - Neutative, plastic widgets - Negative, poorly cut holes - Negative, forcing down - Negative.

Last piece won't fit. Got the unit assembled exactly as per the instructions, but the last piece absolutely will not go in with the back board in place. Taking it apart again broke the fitting off one piece as well as splintered the holes around another. Looks good in the showroom, but not sturdy enough to be dismantled. Can't recommend it.;Last piece won't fit - Negative, instructions followed - Neutral, not sturdy enough - Negative, won't recommend - Negative.
Great closet organizer. This is my second, stacked on top of the first. Great for organizing my closet.;Great closet organizer - Positive, stackable - Positive.
Poorly Designed. Good appearance, works well. Came with small damage on surface, but this is ok for me. The only thing I cannot accept is that the shelf is suuuuuuper difficult to assemble. It is extremely hard to insert small wood sticks into holes on board, which makes the wood sticks so easy to snaps. Thank to the stupid wood stick, my finger got hurt. I hate this design, indeed. Why don't you just give more screws?;Good appearance - Neutral, works well - Neutral, poorly designed - Negative.

Excellent value, great look!. Using as TV stand in first apartment. Great look, very quick and easy to assemble.;Great look - Positive, excellent value - Positive, quick assembly - Positive.
Great for small storage. Purchased this to add to a 2x4 Kallax in the walnut effect color. Didn't realize how glossy the high gloss white would be, but it looks nice (reminds me of a white board). Pretty easy to assemble (~20min), and the drawers glide nicely. Had to screw it into the Kallax, so if we ever want to change the location or flip the orientation of the shelf, we'll have to figure out how to cover up the holes. We did not pre-drill holes and it worked okay. Also, there are markings on the top edge of the drawer for the material type/recyclability that I assumed were a peel off adhesive, but they are not. Pretty ugly since that's what you see every time you open the drawer. Not sure why that wouldn't be in a less visible spot.;Small storage solution - Positive, walnut effect - Neutral, glossy finish - Neutral, easy assembly - Positive, smooth drawers - Positive, visible markings - Negative.
Fabulous shelf unit. Fabulous shelf unit;Fabulous shelf unit - Positive, no specific characteristics mentioned in the sentence.
Liked it so much I bought a second. I bought this originally for my daughters bedroom. This thing is massive but it is amazing! I liked it so much I bought a second one for my office.

It doesn’t look cheap or flimsy.;Great idea for divider - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, no cracks or missing pieces - Positive, not cheap or flimsy - Positive.
the high gloss white laminate can shatter and chip. I'm a fan of the old Expedit bookcases - I have two in birch and they've held up quite well. This is my first time trying Kallax and my experience has been a bit mixed. While the price is excellent, I'd rather pay a little more and get a higher quality unit like Expedit. While the basic look and feel is similar to Expedit, I'm disappointed there isn't a birch option. I went with the high-gloss white and it has some issues. First off, the edges all come wrapped in protective tape that's a real bear to remove. Second, the laminate shatters to pieces when your hammer strays even a tiny bit off the mark during assembly. I get it - it's my fault that I don't use a hammer most days so my aim is off, but the result is that my new shelf unit doesn't look so new. I just hope the damaged areas don't flake off any further.;High gloss white laminate - Negative, protective tape - Neutral, shatters and chips - Negative, price is excellent - Positive, disappointed with the quality - Negative.
Great Addition to Help with Storage Issue. I just assembled this shelf. It took les than 2 hours for two people together. Nice and sturdy. I think it is good quality and attractive. I was concerned it would look cheap, but it looks real nice. I am happy with my purchase.;Great addition - Positive, Nice and sturdy - Positive, good quality - Positive, attractive - Positive.
good idea. but didn't really work. the screws require extra steps to actually get into the shelf sides. Read nail first, then a bigger screw, finally the screw that comes in the package. also, my door doesn't really close. kind of pops out beyond the shelving unit. positive - you can easily remove the back of the insert if you want to use that shelf for something with cords.;Requires extra steps to insert screws - Negative, door doesn't close properly - Negative, removable back for cords - Neutral.
Best modular furniture build yet. I've put together hundreds of modular furniture pieces and this one is by far the best planned and executed I've ever seen. Instead of using lots of weak screw connections this uses dowels (I love to add glue to them) that have better holding power and are cheaper to provide, easier to install and last longer. The instructions used no text to explain the process and were extremely easy to follow. The overall sturdiness and solidarity of this furniture is far and above the rest. It comes in 4 boxes which also make carting it around much easier to do.;Best planned and executed - Positive, uses dowels - Positive, easy-to-follow instructions - Positive, sturdy and solid construction - Positive.

Oh well. I took this home and painted it and after it dried took it in and went to install and found out it didn't fit, my Ikea cabinet was not deep enough. Not sure if I bought the wrong size or It was on display in a different cabinet but now I cant use it. lol;Ikea cabinet - Neutral, not deep enough - Negative.
Great look. I purchased this product this month and I went back and brought another and I am so glad I did because it open my family room up to giving it this look of elegant.;Great look - Positive, elegant - Positive, open up space - Positive.
Great item.. I love the Kallax. It took me a couple minutes to realize there was a protective film on the sides of the shelves, top and bottom. Was relatively easy to put together but it is best to have 2 people do this. I didn't like that the dowels had to be hammered through the shelf and the hammer caused a little minor damage...nothing noticeable unless you know it's there. Best to try to use a rubber mallet maybe. But all in all, I really like it. I plan on buying some inserts but haven't gotten that far yet.;Protective film - Neutral, relatively easy assembly - Positive, best to have 2 people - Neutral, dowels require hammering - Negative.
Low quality and weird fit. These are easy to assemble. However, you need to screw them to the Kallax shelves. So, as others have mentioned, once they are in, they are in. My drawers did not slide in in such a way that they are level or that did not leave a gap at the top or the bottom. I had purchased two. One is going back, one is going in the trash.;Easy to assemble - Neutral, Low quality - Negative, weird fit - Negative.
Don't worry, you can do it too.. In spite of the negative reviews by a couple of others, the Eket CAN be put together successfully. Just follow the pictorial instructions, and use your brain a little. What you end up with is a very structurally sound cabinet that is PERFECT for LP records! When the back is slid in, the top piece put on, and the clips inserted into the holes behind the back panel, the enclosure becomes very stiff and stable, unlike the somewhat wobbly Kallax, which has no back panel. I love the Eket!;Structurally sound cabinet - Positive, perfect for LP records - Positive, stiff and stable enclosure - Positive, unlike wobbly Kallax - Positive.

Always a Versatile Favorite. We wanted two eight cube units and the store was sold out so we bought four of the four cube units and what was a disappointment at first worked out to be a plus.

They hold a mix of things. When we redid our loft library we bought two more to use as book shelves. The unit is sturdy and easy to assemble.;Love these - Positive, sturdy - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, versatile - Positive.

Easy on the eyes and functional. Bought this for pantry storage in my kitchen and I love the industrial look! Even though it's not super sturdy (not heavy steel), it's sturdy enough to do the job.  I suggest reading the instructions thoroughly before assembling. I was able to put it together in about an hour with a few mistakes (not reading the instructions) along the way. You do have to make your own holes into the wooden boards to secure with screws, but it's not as bad as it sounds.;Easy on eyes - Positive, industrial look - Positive, functional - Positive, not heavy steel - Neutral, sturdy enough - Positive, needs instruction reading - Neutral, easy assembly - Neutral, self-drilling holes - Neutral.

The classic shelves. There's not a ton to say about this. It does exactly what it looks like, and does it well. I bought this to store my board games, along with some books, and the divided shelf space is great for keeping things organized. It looks good, it has a ton of space to place things, it's pretty sturdy (definitely more than other IKEA stuff I've had) ... this would definitely be my recommendation for anyone who needs some shelves for whatever reason.;Classic shelves - Positive, does exactly what looks like - Neutral, divided shelf space - Positive, great for organization - Positive, sturdy - Positive.

look nice, easy to assemble. these add so much to the Kallax room dividers. They turn Kallax into something much nicer. I also bought a two-tiered Kallax set, turned it on it's side, added white inserts to the bottom and turned it into a workable side table and shelf in my guest room/art studio. They look nice.;Nice look - Positive, easy assembly - Positive.
Walk-In Closet & Laundry Room. A great solution for my new walk-in closet and for my laundry room! I bought a total of 10 Kallax shelving units - I used 3 of the 2 wide x 4 tall units (standing vertically) and topped them each with a 2 wide x 2 tall unit.  I used double hanging rods between them.  I used the last of the 2 wide x 2 tall horizontally and hung it to be level with the center 2 sections of the vertical unit. I added drawer inserts and purchased jewelry organizers for them -- then added a vanity mirror and a rack for hanging long necklaces and WOW -- a great closet for almost no money. (I did buy quality cabinet knobs for the drawers to replace the small/ugly modern ones).  The 1 wide x 4 tall units went into my laundry room (with door fronts), so I can neatly organize & store all the cleaning and ironing items. They look great and hold so much! (Again, bought quality knobs for the door fronts) Lastly, I'd like to say that I assembled all of these and attached them to the wall by myself -- I'm a small senior female, so if I can do it, anyone should be able to. I really like the way the directions are presented -- the drawings make everything very clear and simple to follow. In all, a great experience -- the worst part is schlepping to IKEA to get the units vs having them delivered (IKEA -- you need to talk to Amazon to make online shopping/delivery easy and affordable). I really love the look and the functionality of my closet and my laundry room, and my friends are just amazed!;Walk-in closet - Positive, Laundry room - Positive, well-organized - Positive, clear directions - Positive, functional - Positive, affordable - Positive.

Great deal for the affordable. Great deal for the affordable price!;Affordable price - Positive
Changed size. We bought this shelving unit a few years ago and love it.  We decided to get another one to go next to the one we already have.  You would think it would be the same, but no. For some reason Ikea thought it would be a good idea to change the width of the outside edges and now they are not the same height.  So be sure to double check every little detail if you are trying to match something new to something you already have.  Even if it's the same thing, it might be different.;Bought shelving unit - Positive, same product - Neutative, outside edges changed size - Negative.
Too elegant!. absolutely beautiful, durable and functional When it comes to a beautiful storage, no other IKEA product works as functional. We used the book shelving in a whole new way to make an office wall unit.;Absolutely beautiful - Positive, durable - Positive, functional - Positive.

As she ages we plan on adding drawers and doors.;Great look - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, intended for Montessori play area - Neutral, planned addition of drawers and doors - Positive.
Much harder to put together than I thought. I've put a lot of Ikea furniture together over the years. This Kallax 2 X 4 unit was probably the most difficult piece I've had to do. Granted, the instructions call for 2 people and I did it by myself, but the main problem was the wooden dowels were too big for the holes and it was incredibly hard to get the pieces to go together. Also, the MDF in this piece seems more fragile than usual, and pieces of it crumbled off while I was working on it. And the directions for attaching the caster wheels are incomprehensible and contain incorrect information. I had to watch a YouTube video to figure out what to do. Now that the piece is together I love it. But I would not buy another one because of how unpleasant the assembly was. On a positive note, I also bought the Kallax 1 X 4 and that was a breeze to assemble. I'll buy more of those!;Difficult assembly - Negative, wooden dowels too big - Negative, MDF seems fragile - Negative, incorrect caster wheel instructions - Neutative, love final piece - Positive.

Very sturdy shelf - repurchasing!. A year ago, I helped pick out this shelf for my roommate to purchase for our living room. It functions very well as a TV stand. We purchased the dröna boxes to go in the bottom 4 spaces. We use the top 4 spaces for our electronics like the wifi router and Apple TV. The shelf is of surprisingly good quality and much sturdier than I expected. Assembling took two people and about 15 minutes. Now that I'm moving, I'm buying the same unit to use at my new apartment. I offered to buy the existing unit from my roommate but they also really loved it and are taking it to their new place. Both of us clearly loved this shelf, so I expect most people would, too.;Sturdy shelf - Positive, good quality - Positive, functions well as TV stand - Positive, quick assembly - Neutral, repurchasing - Positive.

LOVE these for our home office!. Love these for our home office!;Love these - Positive, for home office - Neutral.
Worst IKEA project ever!. I’ve purchased too many IKEA projects to count, some of them much more complicated than the EKET cabinet. This should have been a straight forward assembly, but it wasn’t because the hardware was out of true, the panels would never line up correctly and, in the end, it wasn’t stable enough to use for anything.;Hardware out of true - Negative, panels wouldn't line up - Negative, not stable - Negative.
So in love with these!. I have 3 of these in my home now. They are so sturdy and I love the insert options for them. I use them to store craft stuff in my sewing room and in my bedroom I have one for bathroom storage and one for general storage. My bathroom is so small and has no storage so I set this up just out side the door and it holds all my towels, makeup, hair stuff, and all manner of girly products. This only takes about 30-40 min. to put together but you really should have 2 people. If you push to hard without someone pushing back you could break it.;Sturdy units - Positive, insert options - Positive, quick assembly - Neutral, versatile storage - Positive, easy setup - Positive.

So long to put together!!. I really think this piece is beautiful but in good old Ikea fashion it was missing pieces and it was defective but the piece that was defective was on the 2 to last step so I would have never noticed it. It too filing and some hammer to get off the extra weld that was on said part and it took me several hours to put together. Mind you I am only one person so a second pair of hands would have been helpful. Also if i had all the parts (not needing to do surgery or go to the hardware store) it may have taken and hour or 2 to put together. I gave it four stars because of the price and the look. But beware my fellow Ikea shoppers give yourself some time;Beautiful piece - Positive, missing pieces - Neutral, defective part - Neutral, lengthy assembly - Negative.

Great drawer...but small. This accessory for the KALLAX is okay. It’s more difficult to assemble than I thought and you have to drill it into the main unit. So make sure you’re sure on where you want it.  The drawers work well and very smooth to open and close, but very small.  I like the wire basket and shorter under basket for more storage.  It is a nice accessory if it works for you.;Small drawer - Neutral, more difficult assembly - neutral, smooth opening - Positive, wire basket - Positive.
Great product, but..... Product is great as long as you don’t hang it floating on the wall. The instructions show the product can be hung on the wall floating but they don’t provide the size screws that are needed.

Perfect size. It's exactly what I wanted and I'm going to buy 2 more as soon as I have the chance.;Perfect size - Positive.
Sturdy storage. This shelf happens to be one of my favorite IKEA pieces. I was originally going to buy the 16 slot shelf, however it was out of stock so I went with the nine slot shelf.

Love these!. I use my Kallax to store metal stamping supplies. These drawers are fantastic. They open and close much more smoothly than pretty much any other piece of furniture I have. I have a couple of drawers full of stamp sets, which are basically blocks of solid metal. The drawers glide open and closed just like they were empty and don't have trouble with the weight at all. I'd recommend these to anyone!;Fantastic drawers - Positive, smooth opening and closing - Positive, stores metal stamping supplies - Neutral, recommended - Positive.
Not nearly as nice as they used to be.. We had bought Kallax series shelves in the early days of Ikea's arrival in the U.S. and up in to the early 2000s. Back then the products were well made and very reasonably priced. Now, all they are is cheap. We were very disappointed in the drop in quality of these shelving units. I would much rather pay a little more and get the same quality they used to have than buy something just plain cheap in price and quality. We still have several of our old units that we've moved from home to home and room to room. They've withstood the wear and tear. These new ones definitely won't. The hollow core sides, the thinner shelves and cheaper chip board are not hearty enough to withstand assembly, let alone use! I had to be extra careful after tapping a wood peg into one of the holes and it push out the wood on the other side of the exterior wall. The chip board was already flaking from the ends of the shelf boards and easily flaked as the pegs were tapped in. The color was rubbed off or not painted to the edges of several of the shelves. Very, very disappointed in this product and Ikea's obvious reduction in quality.;Well made - Positive, reasonably priced - Positive, drop in quality - Negative, cheap - Negative, hollow core sides - Negative, thinner shelves - Negative, cheaper chipboard - Negative, assembly not hearty - Negative, easily flaked - Negative.
Good for the price. Looks better than it should. It was difficult to put the dowels in place with a hammer. A little bit too much hammering to get the dowels in place caused some of the wood to chip off. Still looks good though.;Affordable - Positive, Looks better than expected - Positive, Difficult assembly - Neutral, Chipped wood - Negative.
perfect for library storage. I use two of these as storage for my home library and they are perfect! They are incredibly easy to put together (although you put them together on their side and then have to lift them upright and they are HEAVY. Definitely don't skip the step with the looped strap). I've had my original one for three years and it still looks brand new.;Easy to put together - Positive, heavy - Neutral, brand new condition - Positive, library storage - Positive.

Kallax shelf, LOVE IT!. This is the 2nd Kallax shelving unit I have bought. The 1st one is upright using the Drona bins for clothes in my grandson’s room.

Perfect shelf for small plants. This shelf is great in my sunroom to keep my plants more organized. The height between shelves is enough for plants in 4-6 inch containers, and the clear glass let’s more light through to the lower layers.

Great storage for vintage record albums. This is the second shelf we’ve purchased. First time it was the larger one we purchased. After filling it with our vintage vinyl collection we decided on another one to finish the project of organizing records. It is sturdy enough to hold a few hundred records which can be heavy.

Look good, work well. I’m organizing my studio and these storage units are just great for that. They look so clean and neat and are so useful. The 15” cubical openings fit almost any size book and adding bin inserts and drawer inserts makes spaces perfect for storage of awkward odds ends. Is the quality great? No, but good enough. Are they affordable? Yes.  A bother to assemble?

Just what I needed. Actually purchased two of these units in white and one in dark brown. One now has the wheels on it and the other is stationary. The one with the wheels has a painted back on it -- an iKea hack -- and coordinates with cabinets I built. The other is part of an office set up and is sleep, offers storage (with iKea drawers) and iKea boxes to fit in the spaces. The brown one is being used, with drawers and a door, also with iKea storage boxes, as a nightstand. I couldn't be happier.;Ordered two units - Positive, comes in white and brown - Positive, wheels on some units - Neutral, used as nightstand - Positive, offers storage - Positive.

GREAT SPACE SAVER. I BOUGHT THIS AND I LOVE HOW LOVELY & DIFFERENT MY LIVING SPACE LOOKS;Great space saver - Positive, lovely appearance - Positive.
Nice design. Hit or miss with quality.. The first Kalisz I bought was wonderful. I went back to buy a second one, and this one is warped and when you tap on the board, you can hear it is very hollow in spots. Placing objects on it causes cracks. So, quality is hit or miss.;Nice design - Positive, Quality - Neutral to negative.
Love the High Gloss finish!. I bought this a month ago to store fabric in my Craft Studio. It took me about 40 minutes to assemble- all the parts were there and it seems really strong.;High Gloss finish - Positive, took 40 minutes to assemble - Neutral, seems strong - Positive.

The KALLAX products have been the best versatile home storage design to compliment any style of decor.;Great storage - Positive, functional - Positive, good versatility - Positive, complements any style - Positive.
Should have paid more attention. I bought this to hang from the top of my 2x2 Kallax with doors on the bottom. I didn't pay attention to the fact that it will only hang from the narrow middle ledge. They're beautiful and I wish they would have worked!;Beautiful decorations - Positive, intended use miscommunicated - Negative.

Must have item. Kallax is a must have item in every house. Has so many to offer with just a little touch of creativity for your needs in decoration.;Must have item - Positive, has many offerings - Positive.
Great for random storage in a small space. I bought this unit to tuck into a small wall in my sewing room. It's perfect to hold my notions and equipment without taking up too much room. My only wish is that it was taller -- maybe a 5x3 squares version. I know I can add a 2x3 piece on top, but I'm not loving the idea of the double-thick edge that would give me.;Small space storage - Positive, holds notions and equipment - Positive, wish was taller - Neutral.
Solid construction but white is easily scuffed. I bought six of these several months ago for use in my home office. They are solidly built and were easy to assemble (though a power drill/driver is helpful, as is a second person to help manipulate some of the larger pieces). It was relatively straightforward to get multiple units aligned so that they are all the same height, and look coordinated.  Yet, after a few months of use, the white surface has become scuffed from use. In general, the matte wood surfaces are difficult to clean, as it is not perfectly smooth and absorbs cleaning spray (so dusting with a damp cloth doesn't work well). I've been unable to get the scuffs off (they come from books being used, staplers and other office stuff being shifted around - so produced from just mild usage). So, I'm expecting to paint these within a year of purchase to freshen them up (and seal the surface for easier cleaning!).;Solidly built - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, scuffed surface - Negative, matte wood surfaces - Neutral.
Great storage!. I bought this unit to put some organization in my kids playroom. It was very easy to put together and it's nice and sturdy.

It matched perfectly with our wall unit.. I bought this to go with our wall unit we also bought from IKEA.;Matched perfectly - Positive.
A Cool Design. I love the design, colors, and size of the piece. Assembly wasn't hard. I used an electric drill to very carefully pre-drill the holes for the many screws attaching the two wood shelves to the frame. I was surprised that screw holes weren't already pre-drilled. It would have been a challenge for me to get the screws in straight without pre-drilling. I was disappointed that the lower metal shelf bowed when I put a box filled with scrapbooking paper and supplies on it. I'd thought the metal shelf would be stronger. I took several things out of the box and stored them elsewhere, so I wouldn't permanently bow the shelf.;Cool design - Positive, colors - Positive, size - Positive, challenging assembly - Neutral, bowed metal shelf - Negative.
Shelf unit for child's room. I really am impressed with this unit - the quality is great and it looks wonderful in my grandson's bedroom.

Great. These shelves are perfect for everything. They are sturdy and look great. I bought another shelf to put right next to a shelf I bought exactly a year ago. The shelves are the exact same size, color, and finish, but the new shelf's color is more off white than my older shelf. It's just a small difference in color, but a little annoying that the color changed from last year.;Perfect for everything - Positive, sturdy - Positive, look great - Positive, color change - Neutral.

Great storage!. Very needed in kid's playroom!;Great storage - Positive, needed in kid's playroom - Neutral.
Great shelf unit, but wall anchor system is poor!. Assembly of the shelf unit was easy. The unit is quality. However, we use it in vertical mode. This requires wall anchoring. The provided anchor system does not reach the wall. The designers have not accounted for floor molding. The anchors need to have adjustable positions so the anchor can be attached to the wall. As is you probably will have to design your own adapter blocks to attach to the wall. Looks like IKEA has not learned from their tip over problems.;Quality shelf unit - Positive, poor wall anchor system - Negative.
Sturdy cube. Really sturdy and easy to clean. Easy to assembly.;Really sturdy - Positive, Easy to clean - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive.
Great fit and looks nice. I purchased the drawers for use in my craft room. I have both IKEA shelving as well as some I purchased elsewhere. The cubes fit fine in either.

Great for tall items!. I bought two of these. The first one went together easily, the second was a bit trickier as the holes for the wooden pegs were tight and I broke 2 pegs (had just enough with both bookcases) Love the storage as I have many books too large to fit into regular bookshelves and will buy more.;Great for tall items - Positive, Easy assembly (first unit) - Positive, Bitter assembly (second unit) - Neutral, Love storage - Positive, Broken pegs - Negative, Will buy more - Positive.

We'll see how the quality stands up in Texas heat.;Versatile - Positive, functional - Positive, durable quality - Neutral.
Great Flexible Storage. I bought this for storage in my guest room used mainly by my young grandchildren. The room is tiny. The scale is perfect and it is sturdy and attractive. Assembly was relatively simple, but not quite as easy as the video made it seem. It needed a bit more strength to push some pieces into the final 1/4” of alignment than I had, but my husband got everything to pop into place just right. Great quality for the price.;Great flexible storage - Positive, perfect scale - Positive, sturdy - Positive, attractive - Positive, relatively simple assembly - Neutral, great quality - Positive, good value - Positive.

Poor fit but doable. The drawers are a great concept but don’t deliver on the fit. We had to fiddle around with the sides and screws to adjust them to line up properly.

it has been out of stock for more than 9 weeks!!!!. I like the color and quality for the price the reason why I give only 2 stars is: I bought this kallax shelf unit in walnut gray effect color I could purchase 1 because they did not have more at that time in Sunrise FL, so I was like no problem I will buy the rest and I will finish my bedroom set in 1-2-3 weeks when they will have it in stock again. well I am still waiting it has been like that for more than 9 weeks now. I am actually really considering to return my self unit and buy my bedroom set from another store. it is ridiculous. I check the store availability in every 4 days. I was planning to order the rest 2 units online but they charged 110 dollars for delivery and they do not have a local pick up option if I order it. I called them and of course they do not know when they will have it again in stock. such a shame! please fix the problem.;Out of stock for weeks - Negative, color and quality - Positive, delivered charge - Neutral, local pick up option - Neutral.

Solid Piece. We set this up and threw some small slanted legs we found online to the bottom and it looks fantastic! Perfect organization for our kids toys.

Provider some sort of little cover for that bolt to make it all clean and white would make it more ideally aesthetic.;Solid piece - Positive, Horizontal setup - Neutral, ideal aesthetic - Positive.
Good if you need drawers, but flimsy sides. We purchased the previous version of these drawers which had full board sides. These drawers have flimsy paste board sides with roller rails pop riveted to the paste board sides. This is a major down grade of these drawers. Seems obvious that this was a cost reduction move.

"Functional + Classy. Accompanied with Ikea's DRÖNA box and VARIERA shelf inserts. Works well for my bedroom needs and provides a classy look. My boyfriend assembled it quickly.

Awful. So disappointed with the quality. Have same unit from 10 years ago, strong, heavy and sturdy. Took this out of the box and was thin, peeling apart and cheap. Not the IKEA I used to know. Size is an inch smaller. Not consistent with what is used to be in the past.;Awful - Negative, disappointed - Negative, thin - Negative, peeling apart - Negative, cheap - Negative.
Terrible delivery service. This isn’t a dig against the product, which overall is great. But rather an expression of my extreme disappointment in IKEA’s delivery methods and customer service. It took well over a month to have a shelf unit delivered to my house after serval terminal delays and the fact the delivery company forgot to load my order onto a truck several times. Both IKEA and the delivery company were indifferent and unwilling to help. I guess all I can say is buy this item in store if you’re serious about owning it in a reasonable timeframe.;Great product - Neutral, terrible delivery service - Negative.

Looks good but materials lacking. I bought this a month ago for my daughter's dorm room. The laminate peeled on several corners of the shelves when we were assembling. One of the corner holes was not drilled out properly so when the screw went in it pushed material up and created a bubble under the laminate. It would have broken through and created a hole had I not caught it. I was able to turn the shelf so the bubble and peeling laminate are not visible from the front but we know it's there. The materials used to make the shelf seemed a little lacking.;Peeled laminate - Negative, corner holes - neutral, lacking materials - Negative.

Great addition. I purchased this for my craft room, and it’s great! Easy to assemble with two people. Cubby holes are nice and deep. Just FYI, the Drona inserts are flimsy and the rattan options don’t truly fit to maximize space, so I bought Better Homes & Gardens inserts that fit perfectly and offer a wide variety of color choices.;Great addition - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, cubby holes deep - Positive, flimsy Drona inserts - Negative.
I love how light and airy it is!. I bought this as a room divider/ plant shelf. Because of the glass and thin frame it creates a very light feeling. Creates privacy without feeling enclosed.

Easy to assemble and love the versatility. I had two 4x2 Expedit before and love them. I just bought two of these 4x1 Kallax, and put one vertically and one horizontally, right next to each other for the kids to play or sit on top of them (Might not hold an adult weight). And I was able to reuse the Drona boxes that I originally purchased for the Expedit. I feel they are not as strong as the Expedit, but happy with the purchase so far, wish they were on sale though.;Easy assembly - Positive, versatile - Positive, love the purchase - Positive, not as strong - neutral.

Great add on to the Kallax system. Makes it easy to close off sets, fairly easy to install.

Looks good, but you get what you pay for. Looks good, seems sturdy, but you get what you pay for. Doors do not align. Issue is that the hinges included for the doors do not allow for alignment (round hole, not slot, as shown in the instruction booklet). Yes, shelf is leveled/squared, but one door attaches and hangs a full 1/4 lower on the frame than the other door, leaving a little space between the middle shelf and the top of the door. The other door is perfect. This problem is not evident until the whole thing is put together (doors go on last). Not worth the trip to return/exchange -- and possibly have the same situation on the next one -- but will not be buying the taller bookshelf to go with it.;Looks good - Positive, sturdy - Positive, doors align (left) - Negative, doors align (right) - Neutral.
Nice unit but I would’ve. Nice unit but I would’ve preferred to have assembled the perimeter pieces and then slid in the shelves as was done with the expedit in the past!

Bring back the expedit design please !!!;Nice unit - Positive, preferred assembly design - Neutral, required two people - Negative, bring back expedit design - Neutral.

Good plant shelf. Good and sturdy but I didn’t attach the wood shelf at the top.  Too much damage from water. Instead I used an old rack from at oven.  Wood and plants don’t mix.;Good plant shelf - Positive, sturdy - Positive, wood shelf at the top - Neutral (due to missing information in the sentence about the condition or sentiment towards the absence of the wood shelf), damage - Negative.

Great. I like what I bought. it looks good in my room. Looking to buy another one.;Looks good in room - Positive.
One of my favorites!. This is one of my favorite pieces of furniture, probably because it’s so different. The raw industrial look is catchy, and it’s rare to find it for such an affordable price. It’s taking extraordinary willpower not to buy the rest of the set and completely redo my living room in all Fjallbo. The design’s not without flaws though. There are no predrilled holes in the wood shelves for screws. While this isn’t too big of a deal for reasonably handy people, it does mean an extra level of care is needed in assembling if you want everything straight. Also, my doors are not exactly flush with one another. I feel if I were to mess around with the leveling feet a bit, as well as the corner braces, I could get them better situated... but it’s a slight annoyance I’d rather not have to deal with in flat-pack furniture.;Favorite piece of furniture - Positive, raw industrial look - Positive, affordable price - Positive, design flaws - Neutral.
Versatile unit. I bought these units and created a sewing room cutting table. I placed two of them back to back and glued a table top on it.

Works great. This isn't the first Kallax shelf I've bought but it's the biggest in this line. The finished product is great, as usual, but this was the hardest one to build so far. We broke two pegs putting it together and had to drill them out. I was extremely lucky that I've saved every extra Ikea peg I've ever gotten and had enough to finish building the shelf - otherwise I'd have been in trouble. My apt isn't big enough to have this thing just sitting around while I wait for spare parts. What I learned is that Ikea needs to have those little wooden pegs more easily available, or possibly include a few extras with every product, not just a few here and there. But like I said, the finished shelf is fine, it works just as well as the others I have.;Biggest Kallax shelf - Neutral (as stated in the sentence, the finished product is fine), Hardest to build - Negative, Breaked pegs - Negative, needed extra pegs - Neutional, Works great - Positive.

Love, love, love!. This shelving unit is perfect in my kitchen. I bought 2. I'm using them for my bar/pantry. My house is tight and everything needs a place. This unit corrals all of my stuff. If it doesn't fit on these two shelving units, I don't need it. The color is the exact shade as the paint of my stairs. I couldn't ask for a closer match. I purchased a Hemnes shoe cabinet to go neItxt to it. I'm going to use the paint on the shoe cabinet for a better match. The Havsta shelves have a rail across the back so things don't fall down behind. I'm thinking of cutting out the baseboards behind for a more flush fit. It is super easy to assemble. I did it on my own in less than an hour. The bigger bottom is great for the booze bottles and the food stuffs are up top.

Easy to assemble and looks great. I have two of these units in my house now - 1 that separates my living room from my office, and one in my craft room to organize all of my supplies.

Multi-room problem solver. We use a white one horizontally in the kitchen to store appliances, etc., added the Linnmon top for countertop. Have two ebony ones horizontally in the living room for TV and media storage, one horizontally in nursery for all baby-stuff. Have used baskets so far, but looking into the additional drawer and door inserts. Even saw blonde wood one being used in an office setting on an Australian TV show.

Great addition to a Studio apartment. I bought this in mind to separate from the living area to my bed area since my Studio is an open floor plan. It is the perfect size for storage without being an eye sore in my apartment, the 4x4 was HUGE.

Looks nice. I got about 3 sets of these drawers to go in 3 shelf units. They are nice and look good.

flimsy and wrong screws. I wanted doors, and because we had to get this set up for a client visit we made do. Unfortunate that they sell a good set of shelves then send this cheap stuff out.

Nice looking shelf!. I bought this for a particular spot in my living room and this shelf is perfect! I love the simple lines, the height and width are just right. The price was very reasonable and it was super-easy to put together and I also bolted it to the wall for safety. My record album collection and books look so nice on this shelf.;Nice looking shelf - Positive, simple lines - Positive, height and width - Positive, reasonable price - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, safety - Positive.
Great Unit. We purchased 3 of these to make a wall unit in our exercise room. 2 standing up and 1 laying.  We put a few doors and drawers in there also. Looks so nice and am able to store a lot in them.;Great unit - Positive, makes wall unit - Positive, stands upright - Neutral, lays down - Neutral, doors and drawers - Neutral, stores a lot - Positive.
Great value for price. Really happy with the quality. Shelves are sturdy enough to withstand my two little ones. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with those little plastic screw covers- with a white bookcase I dislike seeing the silver screw heads.;Great value - Positive, happy with quality - Positive, sturdy shelves - Positive, complaint about missing screw covers - Neutral.
Origami construction. I love the Kallax system but despise the origami structure of this. The old ones were sturdy, this however you have to drill into the cabinet, making it impossible to change the location of the doors. The walls are flimsy and the back looks not that good.;Origami structure - Negative, flimsy walls - Negative, impossible to change doors location - Negative.
Quick to assemble, smooth operation. The drawers were nice and quick to assemble (I bought a bunch and did them assembly-line style and they were done in no time!) The bottom of the drawer slides around a bit while you're trying to hammer the plastic bolts into place - a clamp fixed that and actually helped the hammering go faster, too. Screwing it into the Kallax by hand takes a fair bit of oomph - we were doing five of them and by the end both of us were having a lot of trouble turning the screwdriver anymore. An electric driver might be a good idea, if you can get it in there. I liked that guides were included to make sure you got everything to just the right depth and all - I feel like it would have been easy to overlook the detail and make the user deal with it themselves, but they went that extra mile and it looks great. The drawers themselves move perfectly smoothly, and I feel like they also lent a little extra structural stability to the Kallax unit.;Quick to assemble - Positive, Smooth operation - Positive, guides included - Positive.
Tricky to put together but easy if you do it right. I bought 5 of them, I took each piece out of the box and assembled them as they came out, the first one went together with no problem. I put the next 2 together in the same order as the first but could not get either one to fit together.  I discovered the problem that a lot of people have had. The pieces are placed in some but not all of the boxes in assembly order. You must start with piece #1 and put the proper 2nd and 3rd piece on each side of it.  When you are doing the 3rd side it is very easy to put the wrong piece on, If you do the final side won't fit.  The problem is that piece # 1 has a deeper slot for the back to fit into. If you assemble # 3 wrong #1 will be on the side, not the back. This will cause the back piece to block the final side from sliding into the holes. After discovering this the next 4 went together in less than 2 minutes each.;Tricky assembly - negative, easy with correct order - positive.
Great look!. SO happy I bought this to store home schooling materials. The fabric boxes hold a ton and it all looks terrific. (Yay- no more piles of stuff laying around!);Great look - Positive, holds a ton - Positive, terrific organization - Positive, no more piles - Positive.

Wonderful storage. A shelf collapsed in my closet. Went right to IKEA. This item went together easily and stores tons of stuff.

We love it!. Great storage solution and with the combination of the cubes is awesome!;Great storage solution - Positive, awesome - Positive.
Great-looking, versatile shelf system. We originally bought a 2x2 and 4x4 of the Kallax shelf units a few years ago, for our board game collection. In the intervening years, the collection grew and we decided to grab the 5x5. I've also been looking for a place to store all our art and craft supplies, and it dawned on me that one of these would be perfect for that too, so we got a second unit. The old one is now in an office closet, storing the various cords and other electronics and office things we had. The size of each cube is perfect - just large enough to fit everything in a category together, but providing both stability and separateness to bring everything together and make it feel organized. It really works well for all of the uses we put them to! As far as assembly, it came together pretty quickly but is definitely easier as a two-person job. The instructions want you to build it while it's upright, but we had a lot of difficulty getting the long shelves in sideways, so we built on its side to use our weight to help push the shelves down and in and then turned it onto its bottom when it was done. The first one did come out not quite plumb, perhaps, as a result, so do exercise caution if you go this route. We installed drawers across an entire row and that seemed to actually help straighten it out, so it didn't really make much difference. If you need to organize and store some stuff, you pretty much can't go wrong with these units!;Versatile shelf system - Positive, great-looking - Positive, perfect size - Positive, stability and organization - Positive, easily assembled - Neutural.
Very nice!. Just what I expected! Only reason I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is because a screw wouldn't go in right no matter what so it ended up being a little slanted. Other than that I love it!;Expected - Positive, love it - Positive, slanted - Negative.

Pressure system is troublesome. This is the first IKEA furniture I had so much trouble putting together. The joints did not lineup correctly, I bought 2 and one of them the backboard was not correctly sized and I had to sand down to make it fit.

Perfect for Homeschooling. I bought this for my homeschooling materials/curriculum. It was easy to put together (I did it by myself) and looks great.

And I can see all my stuff.;Great style - Positive, flexibility - Positive, holds a lot - Positive, easy assembly - Positive.
No top shelf?!. I bought this not realizing that the top section is open - no shelf! Why? It doesn't make sense. I would have happily paid a little more to have a top shelf at that opening.

It’s great but.... I bought this a couple of weeks ago and once I got it home part of the packaging was scraped up and therefore the bookcase was damaged.

As Pictured. I bought this to use as a TV stand and storage for dorm room. Works and looks great! I also purchased the storage cubes for it as well.

As advertised. Overall a good product. The shelves are deeper than I expected and hold A LOT of stuff! The quality is so-so, sort of what you'd expect from cheaper IKEA products. While putting it together a few of the wooden pegs snapped in inside of the holes, but the shelves still feel pretty sturdy.

Great Addition to My Room!. I fell in love with the Fjallbo series a while back and i finally had the opportunity to buy the shelf unit! It helped unclutter my room, while adding style. Word of caution when assembling it: make sure you follow the direction exactly, count holes and pay attention to front and back. I had to start over at one point. But it was worth it! Beautiful piece! Pay attention also when putting the doors on. Mine do not line up. Yet. Still have to redo the one side.;"Great addition to room - Positive,unclutters room - Positive, elegant style - Positive, careful assembly - Neutral (with some difficulty).

"NEW SHELVES DON'T MATCH THE OLD SHELVES. FIRST/BIGGEST FRUSTRATION....the 3 Ikeas closest to me College Park, MD; Baltimore, MD and Woodbridge, VA have NOT had the 2 by 2 Kallax birch effect (402.758.13) for at least a month even though it is expected on the next truck.....a bit like Waiting for Godot. SECOND FRUSTRATION I managed to buy one because someone just happen to return one the day I checked. When I put it together THE NEW KALLAX IS SMALLER THAN THE KALLAX I BOUGHT 5 YEARS AGO, so I cannot use the units together. Good news the drawer inserts will still work. I need just one more Kalla (402.758.13). I thought about using a 4x2 Kallax birch effect (502.784.82), however that would leave me with this odd shelf unite that does not match my old shelves and is not useful in my new small space.

"A couple of tips for easier assembly. The holes in the top and bottom are sized so that the screws bite into the wood; so when you screw the top and bottom to the sides, the screws push the two pieces away, no matter how hard you push. The fix is easy: before you put the top and bottom on, drill out the holes a little bit so the screw slides through easily. A 7mm or 9/32 drill bit would be perfect; I didn't have either one of those, so I used a 1/4 and then pounded the screws through with a hammer one time before attaching the top and bottom.  On the subject of pounding, while the wooden dowels can be inserted with a hammer, but a rubber mallet makes it easier to push the pieces into the holes once the wooden dowels are in place.";Assembly tips - Neutral, screws push pieces away - Neutral, drill out holes - Positive, rubber mallet - Positive.

I struggled the entire way, I then found a shopping cart, managed to get it in there, then had to push the cart into my car on the loading dock to get the box in there.

I am very pleased with this product.;Easy to assemble - Positive, holds a lot of material - Positive, can see fabric - Positive, pleased with the product - Positive.
So functional!!. Easy to put together. Great accessories to add to it, like drawers. The drawers were a little more difficult to assemble, but function well with this unit. This is my third unit. Highly recommend it. I recommend putting cushions on the bottom of anything that may scratch the surface though. I use the IKEA rattan baskets and sometimes they scratch the finish if you don't put a barrier between the basket and the unit.

Lots of Trouble.

It functions well now that it is assembled.;Difficult assembly - Negative, unclear instructions - Negative, broken pegs - Negative, hardware store visits - Neutral.
Cost effective, flexible and attractive. I used two units. One horizontally below a window and butted it against another unit vertically creating a corner L shape which combined both storage and open cubes. The open back allows access to the electrical outlet under the window, and the storage flexibility is simply outstanding. We used the Ratan inserts and doors and drawers and open cubes. Looks fantastic for about 10% of the cost of custom units.

. Its one of my favorite items from ikea.;Favorite item - Positive.
Tedious to put together, but nice overall. I bought and put together two of these. This shelf might be tricky if it's your first time assembling furniture. Because it's metal, the screw holes are inflexible and make it difficult to turn the screws (and using a drill is not recommended). There were over 50 screws to put in for each one, so it took me about an hour for each unit. However, the end result was pretty nice and solid. Oh, also, the top wood part didn't have holes pre-drilled, so you have to make your own--just be careful not to drill all the way through so the hold doesn't show on top.;Metal shelf - Neutral, Tricky assembly - Negative, Solid end result - Positive, Inflexible screw holes - Negative.

Good storage. Bought 3 boxes about a month ago. Finally got around to assembling. Got down to the last piece of 1st box and discovered we put one of the pieces out of order.

Add style to any modular unit. Decided to try this on a LAPPLAND television unit since the modular sections are 15x15. I bought one for my unit and when installed, is not perfectly flushed with the edge it is off by about 3-4mm, but it is no big issue - I replaced the flimsy knobs with glass handles from home depot and it looks amazing when completed! Like other people have mentioned, and as the instructions direct, you will need a small power tool to easily and properly install the drawer - this is important to take into consideration since not everyone has a tool handy or feels comfortable using one. Also, like others have stated, it is meant for light objects as the base of the drawers is cheap pressed board, but if you are handy with tools, you could easily cut one of the preferred thickness. For me, the whole process took about 40 minutes.;Adds style - Positive, not perfectly flushed - Neutral, replacement of knobs - Positive, can be used with power tools - Neutral, light objects only - Neutral, installation process - Sentiment: Positive.
Great for toys and books in kids rooms. We have two of these, one in each of our kids rooms for books and toys in bins. They actually like cleaning up their rooms before bed.

Great for Making a Wall Unit. We created a unit that fit our wall perfectly with the narrower open bookshelves and the tall glass door display cabinets. Havsta collection is sturdy and well made and easy to assemble. We love the clean look and the variety in the collection to create the look we wanted to achieve.   The display cabinet has spacer pieces on the back to account for positioning against a wall with baseboards! That was a welcome surprise and really shows the consideration that went into the design.   The spacers were not included for the narrow open shelf though. The anchoring kit for the open shelf does accommodate being set a little away from the wall for baseboards and what not but we still felt more comfortable adding some of our own makeshift spacers to keep the shelf in the right position and not pitching backward.;Perfect fit - Positive, sturdy and well-made - Positive, easy to assemble - Positive, clean look - Positive, considerate design - Positive.

Great room divider. I was a little daunted by the number of boxes this came in, but myself and my roomate, both all of 5ft tall managed it ok. It was a little harder to assemble than some of the other ikea furniture we have, but not excessively so. Definitely recommend having a soft rubber mallet and some old washcloths to pad it to help get it together easier. It makes a great room divider and is very sturdy, especially once fastened to the wall with the provided anchor (you do need to provide your own drywall screws). Overall though it was exactly what i hoped it would be.;Number of boxes - Neutral, manageable with help - Neutral, harder to assemble - Negative, sturdy - Positive, room divider - Positive, well-fastened - Positive.

CDs will not fit in these drawers. I thought this would be perfect to store CDs. Two rows in each drawer with the titles up so I can see them. But alas they are a quarter of an inch too short.

So Disappointed, not like they use to be at all!!. I bought a Kallax about 8 years ago and the door inserts then were all wood and didn't require you to screw into the shelf. I decided I wanted to add 2 more and now they are cardboard and must screw into the shelf permanently damaging it so you can't change it later. They are also much harder to align. VERY disappointed.

Versatile Bookcase with lots of accessories.. This is my second one of these. The first had 25 cubes. This was a lot easier to assemble. As always it fit together precisely and works vertically or horizontally. The accessories (I added lots of drawers) would get tedious unless you use a drill/driver set on low torque. But it was worth it for the finished product. IKEA's bookshelves, cabinets, and anything else you need to assemble looks as good or better than traditional furniture that costs a lot more.

Frustrating assembly. The puzzle from Heck. I've never before had trouble assembling IKEA furniture, but this one threw me for a loop.

I love this. I don't know why I waited so long to buy this. I actually purchased two. I attached them to the walls perpendicularly and created a closed off area (with door passage) in my open floor plan. This became a teen hangout, for all her things, her loft bed, couch and game systems. The Kallax puts together so simply. You don't appreciate how simply Ikea items go together until you buy another box-kit! In any case, once attached to the wall, this is very sturdy. I'm going to buy several more for different uses in my home.;Love this - Positive, bought two - Positive, attached to walls - Neutral, sturdy - Positive, simple assembly - Positive, closed off area - Neutral, became teen hangout - Neutral, several more - Positive.
Perfect storage solution!. The Kallax shelf is a great method of storage instead of a traditional dresser. We own two and really enjoy using them in this way.

This really is a massive. This really is a massive shelf, but it is exactly what we needed organizationally. With all the different inserts or “cubes” available we have customized this shelf into all the things we needed (toy bin for baby, school supplies for our Kindergartner, junk drawer, craft supplies, coffee/tea cart) and still have it look classy! I love that it is easily mounted to the wall for safety (comes with the anchoring device, you just have to provide the actual screw you drive into your wall)! It is really quite easy to put together, once you do the first row and get the hang of it, it’s smooth sailing! I highly recommend if you need a lot of storage and want to customize what that looks like;Massive shelf - Positive, customizable - Positive, safety feature - Positive, easy to put together - Positive.

Very practical. I have almost a dozen of these doors throughout my good, and they are super practical. Yes, I have a *few* Kallax units. These doors are good quality but not excellent - they are a bit delicate and a tad flimsy. They look good though and you can swap the handle to make it fit your decor. Installation is not as easy as you would think but not impossible. Keep in mind that you will be drilling into the sides of your Kallax so if you remove tis insert, you will have holes left.  All in all, they are great to customize the fantastic Kallax.;Practical doors - Positive, good quality -Neutral, flimsy - Neutral, look good -Positive.

"Quality delivered. This was my first purchase with IKEA and I'm definitely going to make more. The quality and esthetic is as promised. The only downside is the construction. I put together 2 of these over a weekend. The fittings are REALLY snug. I don't know about anyone else but, after a week, I'm still suffering from ""IKEA shoulder"".";"Quality delivery - Positive, Esthetic as promised - Positive, Snug fittings - Neutral, Suffering from ""IKEA shoulder"" - Negative."

Nice looking, sturdy, pieces missing. Relatively easy to assemble, once you realize that you are not crazy - there really is hardware missing. I live 2 hrs away from IKEA, so had to improvise.

You need to buy these. I love my Kallax shelves. I actually bought five of them in various sizes. So many things I love about these shelves (in no particular order). 1. They look great. They're clean and simple. 2. The separate pieces are quite light but the unit is very sturdy when it's put together correctly. 3. It's easy to put together. If you get stuck trying to assemble it, you can always find help. 4. The units don't have that annoying particle board backing. I love this because my freshly painted walls aren't covered up by the unattractive backing and it makes it so convenient to plug stuff in. 5. They are so versatile. You can buy fabric totes or drawers or cabinet doors to put in the squares for added flexibility and storage options. This is actually what sold me on these shelves. IKEA sells a cat bed that you can put in the squares (who knew?) and I have one in my Kallax. 6. They are super affordable compared to other cabinets and storage units. Trust me, I scoured the internet for weeks. 7. My Star Wars collection looks great in my Kallax units and I am very happy with them.;Looks great - Positive, sturdy - Positive, easy to put together - Positive, lightweight pieces - Positive, no particle board backing - Positive, versatile - Positive, affordable - Positive, convenient - Positive, Star Wars collection looks great - Positive.

"Perfect for my purpose. This is an excellent replacement for my generic plastic home hardware store shelving, for my doll collection. My only disappointment was that the 24 units are no longer available. However, I have made the 46-1/2 size fit my room satisfactorily. I bought two units without the drawer kit, and four with. I will probably buy one more drawer unit; one shelf will be partially behind another in the corner, so I can't use the drawers for that one.";Excellent replacement - Positive, fits room satisfactorily - Neutral, well-constructed - Positive, no longer available - Negative.

"Great shelf but lacking extras pieces in case. The shelf looks great. I am not experienced in putting things together and am of small frame. I was able to do the all on my own except I need my child to help me to lift it off the floor. That’s a good sign to me; not cheap materials. My only problems with the first shelf (I purchased and put together two) was that it is held together by wooden dowels between the shelves and I broke one. They had zero extras. There were extras for everything else but no extra dowels. The chances of a dowel breaking is pretty high. Why would they not include any extras. I used an extra dowel that was half the size from the drawer inserts I bought. Now here’s the kicker.... when I put the second one I purchased together there was ONE extra dowel! Wow. If I had only opened that particular shelf to assemble first it would have worked perfectly. They are really nice shelves. They look great";Great shelf - Positive, lacking extras pieces - Negative, held together by wooden dowels - Neutral, broke dowel - Negative.
Looks great! Liked the drawers better than cubby. The drawer inserts were easier to put together and looked completely professional when finished. The cubby with pull out door inserts were a little trickier because you had to get the screws just right so the door would open easily and stay closed when shut. I feel like the design could have been better. I thought I would just be installing a door on hinges. It is a box insert. I guess so your stuff doesn’t fall behind the shelf. Just wasn’t as easy as the drawers.;Drawers - Positive, look great - Positive, easier assembly - Positive, professional finish - Positive, tricky cubby - Negative, design could have been better - Neutral.

EKET Cabinet. I have purchased two of these cabinets and am looking to purchase another one. They are both stylish and functional. Putting it together was a bit of a challenge due to the fact that the instructions were not done in the clearest way possible but once you put it together, it is a great piece of furniture. Since it is such a uniquely shaped piece, be aware that most storage boxes sold for other units won't work well here. I suggest purchasing the EKET box which is made to fit perfectly in this unit and look very nice.;Stylish - Positive, functional - Positive, challenging assembly - Neutional, uniquely shaped - Neutral, clear instructions - Negative, great piece of furniture - Positive.

holds LP records. it holds Records which was my use. I also got the doors. its pretty strong. I added some epoxy to help strengthen it up. the wooden dowels are thinner than 1/4 so if you need to you can drill and use dowels, like I did, since I broke their wooden dowels. you have to push some thru the particle board into the vertical board , if you don't alight perfect it bottoms out and breaks. careful...; Holds LP records - Positive, Pretty strong - Positive, Required epoxy addition - Neutral, Thinner wooden dowels - Neutical, Breakable if not aligned correctly - Negative.

Great shelf unit. I bought the grey and wood effect unit since the other colors look rather generic. I added six captiva legs to the bottom to raise it off the floor, horizontally, and it looks better and more high end, plus I can dust under it. Other big box stores carry units that are similiar, but I have found the Kallax unit to be better quality, thicker materials. However, the inserts that go into the unit are now very low quality, so stick with using baskets and don't waste your money on the door unit inserts or drawers inserts. Too bad ikea lowered the quality on those, what a shame. Also this shelf unit is great for records!;Grey and wood effect - Positive, added legs - Positive, high-end look - Positive, thicker materials - Positive, lower quality inserts - Negative, great for records - Positive

Impossible to put together. This was an impulse buy, largely because of the spectacular light orange color on the showroom floor. However, it is impossible to get the backing board on before you add the top. We spent an unbelievable 90 minutes working on this and ended up just leaving the backing off. Too bad because it's such a cute piece and now it has these weird track marks where the backing should insert. It does brighten the kitchen up beautifully.;Spectacular light orange color - Positive, impossible to put together - Negative, brightens up kitchen - Positive.

Great kitchen storage. Our kitchen does not boast a lot of storage space so we bought this to house our “countertop” appliances, like the Instapot, crockpot, and toaster.

Breaks easily, extremely difficult to assemble. I watched a video showing how to assemble this..I started with the piece labeled as 1as shown in the instructions. I did everything right..but the keyholes drilled into the wood have been drilled completely wrong and nothing fits right. The plastic pieces break right off.

Easy peezy and sturdy. Been putting off this purchase and it couldn’t have gone any better between ordering and delivery!

Superb turntable stand. It's easy to miss in the photos but this is an ideal turntable stand. It's at an optimum height and the lower compartment is perfectly sized for LPs including those in slipcovers. With the other matching pieces it makes an excellent media system.  Note that you should use a right angle to insure proper alignment during assembly. There is enough play in all the holes that the unit can be assembled crooked and the doors will be out of alignment. Just wait until you have a second person and a builder's square to align it and do a final tightening of all the bolts (and there are quite a few!). Personally I like that the wood panels don't come pre-drilled for the wood screws. That allows you to pick whichever you think is the best side to face upward. These are real pine so knots are common. If you want more character put them on top. If you want a cleaner tech look then you can hide them.  This unit can be assembled without the doors if desired although you will probably want to use the screws to fill the holes. Since they're black you really don't notice them. We started with the doors off then added them to change up the look.;Optimum height - Positive, perfectly sized lower compartment - Positive, real pine - Neutral, easy assembly with second person and builder's square - Neutral, customizable appearance - Positive.

Perfect. My husband bought two to house his stereo equipment. They are simple and functional.;Simple and functional - Positive.
Great for audio. I purchased 2 of these and the matching cabinet with doors for a vintage audio rack. It works extremely well for that and all the shelves have enough separation for LPs.  Note that this unit does not align with the other two designs because it lacks a wood top for the lower shelves making them about 1/2in low.  These are made in China with the usual quality control problems. One of my units came with mud inside the plastic bag and a corner than hadn't been painted and was already rusting. Living more than an hour from Ikea... Also note that you should use a right angle to insure proper alignment during assembly. There is enough play in all the holes that the unit can be assembled crooked.

"Nice add-on for Kallax. This is a great little add-on for the Kallax unit. Goes together real easy with 4 shelf pins. There are 4 felt strips with adhesive backing that you put on the two side panels, and then the insert just slides into place. The side panels are approx. 1/4"" thick, and the center shelf is approx. 1/2"" thick. I only had one issue where one of my Kallax cubbies was a little off (probably my fault in the original construction) and I had to tap the side of the insert pretty hard to get it in the space.";Easy assembly - Positive, fits Kallax unit - Positive, approx.
Not the same as before. I have bought five of these in the past and love the way they look and how they last.

Eket System. For my Eket purchases, I’ve stuck to buying white, combining it with pieces from either white Kallax or Besta. It has worked out well in two rooms in my home.   In the smaller room there are tight spaces, a large, low window, some lower ceilings, and unexpected corners. The smaller scale of the taller Eket one- and two-door cabinets, some stacked, some not stacked, on two walls, has been combined with a run of low, white Kallax units on the other two walls.   Putting together that room, I found Eket offers many more options and combinations for storage and stylistics in small spaces, compared to larger or old-style furniture systems.   Related to sense of space, the scale and simplicity of Eket, especially when using the taller, doored cabinets, maxs out, rather than minimizes, how the large the small room feels.   For some of the Eket pieces I purchased for the small room, I choose to buy the shallower cabinets as it is easier to squeak them into tight spaces.  In a larger, long, narrow room, with a lower ceiling on one side, the combination of the smaller, randomly stacked Eket “boxes” at the tag end of a run of simple, shorter Besta “frames” (with and without feet), on a low wall, on the floor, is bringing out the best of that space. I’m thinking that’s due to the parallel repetition of long linear lines in both furniture and exposed wood posts, beams, and floor boards. The white cabinets and the simplicity of their lines again maxes out the sense of space within the narrow room.  So, 5 stars for Eket, I think, in bedroom and living room. Maybe 6 stars when scrambled in with other Ikea cabinet systems.;Small spaces - Positive, Taller cabinets - Positive, White finish - Positive, Combines well with other Ikea systems - Positive, Maximizes sense of space - Positive.

So many uses!. I have many of the Kallax of different sizes in our house. It is great that with the addition of doors or drawers and new hardware you can make it fit into so many different styles and uses!! I do wish that there were more insert options in the colors other than white, or the abiltiy to have a door that will cover 2 squares at once, but other than that this is great!;Fits into many styles - Positive, versatile - Positive, different sizes available - Positive.
Just what I was looking for. I was looking for a way to store the various bits and pieces for different projects I am working on in my studio. My usual method was to have a pile somewhere, and add to that pile. Of course, the piles would spill into each other, and eventually became more knitting projects pile and sewing projects pile instead of Knitting Project for Customer A, Knitting Project for Customer B, Sewing Project for Customer C, Sewing project for Customer D. I also wanted a low credenza-like shelf to add work surfaces to the studio, as well. Other, similar products from other companies looked the same online, but were considerably smaller in dimensions. When turned on its side, the KALLAX is a nice height at 30 inches. The whole unit is very heavy, strong, and sturdy. I am very pleased with it.  As far as how well it works for my original needs: I can now see, at a glance, each project and its materials. When new pieces (fabric orders, button orders, new patterns) come in, I can just toss each item into its appropriate cubby, and it is not in danger of intermingling with other projects or getting lost somewhere special where I put it so I wouldn't misplace it. (You know how that goes.) Additionally, the top of the unit turned out to work very nicely as a place to mount my yarn swift, yardage gauge, baller, and scale, resulting in a very effective yarn winding station that remains out of my way, even while set up. The flat-packed package did require two people to move (as, I assume, will the final piece of furniture), but I was able to assemble it easily by myself. Everything turned out nicely square and solid.  I bought the black-brown finish. My studio has a black and white motif, and though this is not a true black, it is close enough to blend nicely with the rest of the room. It really looks more like a wood with a black stain (there is a wood-grain pattern to the finish). The unit is not solid wood, but a composite wood product, but the finish looks very wood-like.;Stores various bits and pieces -Positive, Low credenza-like shelf -Positive, Nice height -Positive, Heavy, strong, sturdy - Positive, Clear work surfaces - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive, Nice finish -Positive.

Always a good choice. We’ve owned several of the Kallax storage cube units in different configurations and have been very satisfied with the quality every time. This size is perfect for storing a lot of books, which was the intended use. You can actually double up if needed (which we did).

Love this!. I love the quality of this. It was relatively easy to assemble and it’s solid. Great value and definitely recommend. The only thing that I might like to see would be an option for a back to enclose the compartments to use as a cubby system instead of shelves. I like these better than other bookshelves because they don’t wobble when put together.;Love this - Positive, good quality - Positive, relatively easy assembly - Positive, solid construction - Positive, great value - Positive.

Hard to align well. It is easy to install but hard to align well if you drilled the hole on the shelf a little off, you are unable to make the door look perfect unless re-drill the hole. I have tried to adjust the screws as the connector gives some adjustable range but the door ends up to be either hitting the bottom or not able to be closed entirely. Initially was thinking to install 2 doors now I don't wanna take a risk to screw the other cub.;Easy to install - Positive, hard to align doors - Negative.

Stand up shelf. Love this shelf. It has large square openings, is thick and looks more expensive than it was.;Stand up shelf - Positive, large square openings - Positive, thick - Positive, looks expensive - Positive.
Not as straightforward to assemble as in the photos.. I have been used to intuitive and error-free procedures for IKEA furniture and this at first look seems easy and straightforward. Only it is not because if you kind of mix the order of putting the sides together which is easy to do as they all seem the same then the pieces don't fit and you have to force them apart and start over. Not a particularly fun thing to do with connections relying on a rather flimsy piece of particleboard.;Assembly not straightforward - Negative, seems easy - Neutral, particleboard connections - negative.

Pleasantly surprised. I was skeptical about purchasing these drawers. I could not find the inside dimensions of the drawer to ensure that my items would fit. I was pleasantly surprised at how much you can store in one of these drawers. The inside dimension of the drawer is 10 ¾” wide and 12” in length. The side of the drawer is only 2 ¾” high, but the overall height of the drawer is 5 3/8”. One drawer holds all my Crystal Nuvo drops (60 plus bottles) and some sprays. I can also get 14 plastic 4x6 cases in one drawer (arranged in a specific order). I have not attached sides of the drawers to the Kallax, so they do move a little when you open the drawer.;Skeptical - Neutral, Pleasantly surprised - Positive, Inside dimensions - Neutral, Holds Crystal Nuvo drops - Positive, Plastic cases - Positive.
Not recommended for records. I assumed from the pictures and dimensions that this would be a good fit for vinyl records, but it's such a tight fit that it's impractical. Vinyl sleeves ostensibly do fit, but any records that are slightly too tall have to be squeezed in, and the records are hard to get out. The cubes are also tedious to assemble because you have to slide the dowels into place. Fortunately, returning them in person was a painless process. Despite all that, I'd still recommend this product, so long as you use them for books or something other than records. And as always with IKEA, it's a good value.;Not recommended for records - Negative, tight fit - Negative, impractical for records - Negative, good value - Positive, tedious assembly - Neutative, good for books - Positive.
Love it. Really keeps my stuff organized. I bought one 10 years ago and I just bought my second one 3 weeks ago. Really love the depth- can fold and place jeans and bulky/ messy clothes like bathing suits in this.;Keeps stuff organized - Positive, love it - Positive, high depth - Positive.
Small shelving. It’s nice and work will for displaying or for storage of books;Small shelving - Neutral, will work - Positive, for display or storage - Neutral.
"Don't Expect this to be like the original Expedit Doors. I loved the Expedit doors that you could slide in and out and re-position (you decide that your shelves should be in another room? You want to flip it on its' side? Easy! Just pull the doors out and flip them 90*!)  Now, the doors look nice from the outside but are so poorly made that the only way for them to have any structural integrity is to drill them into the sides of the shelf as outlined in the new instructions. No longer removable/repositionable without destroying your Kallax shelf from drilling multiple holes and if you ever decide you want to remove the doors to just have an open bookshelf, you'll be stuck with a ton of unsightly drill holes on the inside.   I bought four expecting them to be like the original ""slide in, slide out"" doors and after I opened the first one I realized how different they are now. I'll be returning the items I can.";Slide in, slide out doors - Negative, structural integrity - Negative, removable/repositionable - Negative, look nice (from outside) - Neutral, drilled into sides - Negative.

"Great quality, great price. When looking for shelving for our kids' playroom, I shopped around quite a bit.

Great shelf!. Great! Sturdy, looks good. I also bought the legs that go with this shelf so that I can stand it on its side and use it as a toy, books, accessories shelf for my baby's room.

Other similar shelves from other stores that are closer in price if not a bit higher tend to be more flimsy and don't come with the legs.;Sturdy - Positive, looks good - Positive, great quality - Positive, affordable price - Positive, comes with legs - Positive.
"Look ok / Quality lacking. I bought 4 of these to install in a bright green Kallax. The first three installed fairly easy. The fourth one gave me a lot of difficulty; one of the hinge side screws somehow broke a large hole in the side of the Kallax resulting in it being useless.  Overall I am happy with the look of this product. However, I wish that it was offered in right/left options. My unit is in a very tight corner and I’d prefer the doors to open out from the center rather than up against the wall. I also wish that the interior of the insert was black to match the door rather than bright white. If you’re using it in a white Kallax it would work. But in any other color Kallax, the white really stands out.

Just love them!;Versatile - Positive, Attractive - Positive, sturdy - Positive.
Exactly as expected. I bought two of these to place side-by-side in my office. I noticed several reviews complaining about the difficulty of putting these together, but I found them easy to assemble. After connecting each panel by hand, you will need a rubber mallet to gently tap the panels together. Do NOT use a hammer. Use a rubber mallet and GENTLY tap the panels in place.

High gloss delicate, be careful. While it looks better and comes with a premium, the high gloss surfaces are delicate. I have about 5 regular Kallax items in dark brown/black and none were this delicate.

Love this shelf!. I bought this shelf to use as a plant stand near my windows. It works perfect, has enough height in each shelf (there’s only a few big plants I can’t fit on it so I put them on the top) and I love that the shelves are glass so that light can get through. I was debating just getting the cheaper shelves that ikea offered but I’m happy I splurged for these! Some of the screws did get stripped easily during assembly and were hard to really get in but you just need to take your time with those.

Impossible to put together. DO NOT BUY. Wish I actually read the reviews before driving 2.5 hours to an Ikea and purchasing 4. These are impossible to put together. I literally needed to hammer the first one together because there is no way I could get the two pieces to slid together. On the second one I broke the connectors because even hammering wouldnt make them slide into place. Not sure what I am going to so considering I live so far away from the nearest Ikea so returning is a HUGE inconvenience. I may just use wood screws like they should have used in the first place.

I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. Online it said they were in stock. Even at the store it said they were in stock, but they weren't. Since I do not live close to the store, I did not want to waste my trip and so I settled for buying the Kallax bookcases instead. I bought 4 of them, all different sizes. I was very disappointed.   Regardless of size they are held together with 8 screws and wooden dowls. The wooden dowls do not fit well into the holes. Since they are a few inches long but thin, a few of them broke. Luckily I have tools and my own dowl jig so I drilled them out, widened the holes and used bigger dowls.  I also had to use a rubber mallet to tap the dowls fully into the holes. I then had to also use the mallet to tap everything together because I could not push everything together snuggly and I'm pretty big.   I eventually got everything together but it was a lot more work than it needed to be. They can either use thicker dowls and/or drill their holes ever so slightly bigger so everything will fit together easily.   I never had these problems when assembling their Billy bookcases of which I have 12 or 13 of.;Billy Bookcases - Neutral, in stock - Neutral, thin dowels - Negative, broken dowels - Negative, poorly fitting dowels - Negative, wide holes - Negative, rubber mallet required - Negative.

Good but…. There’s a lot of space wasted at the back of the drawers, as they don’t reach all the way to the back of the cube when closed. It’s weird considering how well IKEA uses every available inch. I wish the drawer sides were higher too, they are quite short. Can’t put anything too heavy in there either as the bottoms of the drawers are quite flimsy.

Difficult assembly.. I've put IKEA furniture together for years. This piece, as others have commented, is a pain to put together. I followed instructions exactly. The last board cannot slide into place because the back piece needing to be in the slot cannot fit until after it's together, which makes no sense. Waste of money as the piece is damaged trying to get it put together. Buy the allen wrench, screwed pieces.;Difficult assembly - Negative.
Perfect size for storing vinyls. I bought this specifically for the purpose of storing our records since our collection had outgrown the little shelf we were using. The shelfs are perfectly sized for this. I'd had my eye on another, similar shelf from a different home goods store, but it was much more expensive so I was excited to get a better deal.  That being said, I've bought plenty of IKEA pieces in the past and know that sturdiness is not a strong suit and instructions are somewhat lacking in specificity. With that in mind, I tried to be as gentle as possible when putting the shelf together. However, after some confusion with the instructions where I had to separate pieces I'd put together, I ended up with a couple of small cracks and bumps. Luckily it was tucked in the back and I was able to remedy with duct tape and white paint so you can't really tell. Overall, I'm happy with it but know I'll probably end up replacing it with a sturdier piece sometime down the road.;Perfect size for vinyls - Positive, suitable for records - Positive, sturdiness - Negative, acceptable - Neutorials instruction - Neutral.

I would buy this product again and plan on adding more Kallax pieces of different sizes in the future.   I docked one star because the product arrived with damage that obviously occurred before or during packaging. The damage is on visible pieces and IKEA expects you to personally return the item to the store or accept a discount and settle for a damaged shelf (because return services are not currently available).

Looks great, not hard to assemble. I almost didn't buy the EKET cabinet since so many people complained about the assembly, but I figured I'm usually pretty good at assembly, and this time proved no different. The first one took about a half hour, including the underframe, the rest about 20 minutes each. A few tips - 1. Look closely at each piece illustrated in the directions to make sure it's facing the right direction before you try to interlock the pegs and holes. Sounds obvious, but it can be deceptive. 2. A rubber mallet (or hammer with a piece of leather or thick blanket over your strike area) makes locking the pegs into the holes much easier. I can see how people expecting a truly tool-less process would find this part difficult. 3. Use common sense with the black pegs that secure the backing, push the pin in only as far as it will go, they don't all have to be equally tight. 4. If attaching the underframe, an electric drill does make it easier. Once it's done, it looks great, sleek and slim but not flimsy.;EKET cabinet - Neutral, looks great - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, assembly tips - Neutral, sleek and slim - Positive.

My husband love it. My husband love it;I'm sorry, it seems the sentence doesn't contain any key characteristics or explicit sentiment related to the product itself.
Stylish, Versatile, Affordable. The Kallax (and previously the Expedit) series is possibly the best product that Ikea has ever produced. I can't think of a more versatile piece of furniture.   Need some book cases? 4x5 Kallax. Liquor cabinet? 4x1 Kallax with a few hacks. Custom desk setup? 2x4 Kallax with some modifications.  I say this with first-hand experience, because I personally own a dozen (seriously, literally 12) individual Kallax units of varying sizes and am using them as a linen drawer, art supply case, book case, extra dining-room storage, a modified desk, and a room divider, and more. My apartment is probably 50% Kallax by volume. These things are awesome!  Their modern yet simplistic style, and the sheer efficiency of perfectly square cubby holes, make this the swiss army knife of affordable furniture.;Stylish - Positive, Versatile - Positive, Affordable - Positive, swiss army knife - Positive.
Great Shelf Unit. I got this to make as a divider for my living room and it’s so useful in many ways. Plus I always get compliments on it.;Great shelf unit - Positive, divider for living room - Positive, gets compliments - Positive.

Easy to assembled and looks. Easy to assembled and looks great;Easy to assemble - Positive, looks great - Positive.
Solid quality, versatile. I bought this one and the tall one and hacked them because I wanted the iron/solid wood look. So I took one of the wood panes to a lumber shop, found some nice wood and had it cut to size. I sanded that, gave it polish, and replaced the top and the glass pane. Now it looks like something bought at WS, super elegant and it's mostly Ikea and some DIY!;Solid quality - Positive, versatile - Positive, DIY project - Neutral.

Great shelf unit!. I love these shelves! I bought 2 to cover a wall in our toy room, and the cubbies are perfect for storing lots of different things - a bin of small toys in one, stuffed animals in another, books in another, etc. I took off one star because the wood pegs provided for assembly are just a bit too long, making it impossible to get a tight fit. I thought it was just a fluke or they weren't going in all the way, but every peg was the same size and no amount of banging or applying pressure (i.e. my husband leaning almost his entire 200 lbs of weight on it) made them fit better. So there is a little gap between the main sides and the inner shelves, but luckily it is not really noticeable when there is stuff on the shelves.;Love these shelves - Positive, cubbies perfect for storing - Positive, slight gap between main sides and inner shelves - Neutral.
. Easy to assemble. Doesn’t feel very strong when assembled. Suggest assembling where it will be put. Moving once built not a great idea.;Easy to assemble - Positive, doesn't feel very strong - Neutral, suggest assembling in place- Neutral.

And the price is very affordable.;Organising must-have - Positive, helps keep things organized - Positive, versatile - Positive, looks great - Positive, affordable price - Positive.
Exactly what we wanted. We used the Capita legs with this since we didn’t want it sitting directly on the tile floor. It works perfectly.;Works perfectly - Positive, used Capita legs - Positive.
Easy to put together.. This shelving unit is very easy to assemble. Looks nice and was extremely affordable. It's comes with brackets to anker the shelf to a wall. If you don't reinforce the shelf it is a bit wobbly, but for the price you get what you pay for.;Easy to assemble - Positive, Affordable - Positive, looks nice - Positive, comes with brackets - Neutral, wobbly - Neutral.
the perfect craft room. Im creating the perfect craft room these are great;Perfect craft room - Positive, these are great - Positive.
Bookcase for family room redo. It was absolutely just what I wanted. We got 6 pieces of the havsta for our wall.

More chocolate.;Affordable - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive, Sturdy - Positive, brown color desired - Neutral (but could be considered a preference rather than a sentiment).
Simple, effective. It’s amazing what $100 and some vision can do to change a room. In my new home, my son’s room size literally shrank by half leaving us little space for his toddler books and trucks (he has a lot). I easily assembled the EKET boxes and my husband mounted them (easily) into the studs using the rail systems, and what a change. IKEA for the save.;Effective solution - Positive, Amazing change - Positive, Easy assembly - Positive.

Perfect shelf for a bedroom. I bought this shelf to match the white, furniture asethetic in my bedroom, and I love the features it has. Since there's a solid wooden surface on the bottom and top, I use those to support my heavier items (each can carry 15 lbs). The third shelf height works great with my IKEA desk for a printer with enough clearance to lift my printer and scan items. This works great for storage and for displaying momentos.;White furniture match - Positive, solid wooden surface - Positive, supports heavy items - Positive, third shelf height - Positive.

Great piece of furniture. Of all the brands of 4 by 4 cube organizers you could get, IKEA’s is the best quality.;Great piece of furniture - Positive, best quality - Positive.
Minimal, modern beauty. Great quality.. When anchored to the wall it is very sturdy. Anchoring is a must. Metal construction feels high end. I have had this in my child’s nursery room for the last 2 years and it is perfect for combination of display shelving, storage (with drawers) and book storage. Love the minimalist and versatile design.;Minimal design - Positive, modern beauty - Positive, great quality - Positive, sturdy when anchored - Positive, versatile - Positive.
Nice looking. It was a bit tough to put together by myself, but I managed. One part didn’t 100% slide into place, but once all set up, it’s hardly noticeable.;Nice looking - Positive, tough assembly - Neutral, one part didn't slide into place - Neutral.
I love the whole Kallax system.. I have being buying Kallax for years. I keep adding doors and drawers over time to keep clutter out of sight but leave some spaces open for things that I want to display. You can use as a room divider or cover a whole wall with storage as I did. The core is filled with recycled corrugated cardboard so units are not too heavy. Of course you should always anchor the unit to the wall or ceiling.;I love the whole Kallax system - Positive, adding doors and drawers - Positive, cover a wall with storage - Positive, not too heavy - Neutral, anchor to wall or ceiling - Neutral.

I love buying and building Ikea furniture!;Perfect fit - Positive, holds records and collectibles - Positive, excellent materials - Positive, easy directions - Positive.
Terrible construction. Love the idea of EKET, but the pegs and holes are so poorly made nothing actually fits together very well. You have to put your entire body weight on every piece to make it fit. 3 pegs broke completely away from the unit and it is useless. These are not worth even $5.;Terrible construction - Negative, poorly made pegs and holes - Negative, few pieces fit together well - Negative.
Great versatility. I have two because I love that you can have them tall or wide, they can be used for so many things and are great storage. Easy to put together, highly recommend!;Great versatility - Positive, can be tall or wide - Positive, easy to put together - Positive, great storage - Positive.

Earthy and Elegant. I bought three of these for my new wellness/fitness studio. They line up next to each other perfectly (because of the adjustable feet). Lots of studios use Kallax shelving, so I like that I have a different look. I had no difficulty building them but I am somewhat handy. I would say they are a bit more complex to build than other Ikea pieces.;Adjustable feet - Positive, different look - Positive, no difficulty building - Neutral, more complex to build - Neutral.
Kalax Shelf Perfect Fit!. I was trying to find another shelving unit to match the TV set that I also bought at IKEA and it matches perfectly! Height and color! They look great and my girlfriend and I love it!;Perfect fit - Positive, matches TV set - Positive, height and color - Positive, love it - Positive.
Never too many bookshelves!. We bought this nearly a month ago for use in my eldest daughter’s bedroom. She had shorter desks she had outgrown, and with the need for her to have time to intensely focus for a couple of her school subjects, hooking a desktop to these shelves and have all of her books and binders available to slide right out onto her desk has been perfect! (We homeschool, so we have a LOT of books!)  We have two of this same shelving units in black/brown and two larger, and 4x4 and 5x5 in the black/brown. I was thrilled to see that they finally made this in the white!;Perfect for keeping books - Positive, available to slide out - Positive, satisfied with purchase - Positive, multiple units - Neutral.

Great storage combo!. I am so happy with my purchase of this storage combination. I am using it in my entryway so that there are drawers for hats/mittens, and storage for other items in the upper pieces for me. These were all easy to put together. I know some comments on the upper piece with the doors said that they couldn't get them to align properly. Mine align perfectly. I had to play with it a little bit, but they are perfectly aligned and fully functional. This set looks so clean and sleek and it's so easy to use for the kiddos. Perfect addition to my home. I purchased in the dark gray. Take your time to put the pieces together and follow the instructions - just like any IKEA product - and you'll be just fine. I'm contemplating buying more of these pieces for other parts of my home.;Great storage - Positive, easy assembly - Positive, perfect alignment - Positive, clean and sleek - Positive, easy for kids to use - Positive.

"Great unit!. We bought two of these for a closet/small den area. We put one horizontal like a low dresser, and another vertically, like a bookcase. It's pretty great because they match so well. I like the grey with wood color; it looks sleek and modern but still warm. We put the seaweed baskets in them which fit well (though be careful because sometimes the baskets can be pokey, and make clothes smell like straw), and one the horizontal one, added the kallax grey doors. I wish the doors came with golden knobs because the silver knobs on them don't match the warm tone of the wood as well. Overall, seem sturdy, fantastic price, not too hard to assemble, and really add a ton of store (equivalent to a full sized dresser) to a space. We're excited that if we move again someday we could repurpose them easily as a tv stand, or bookshelf in virtually any room of the house. We might even get another for our bedroom!

Looks great. Gonna start of by saying use a power screwdriver! Since this is an add on there are no pre-drilled holes. It takes a good amount of arm strength to use a regular screwdriver. I’ve installed them with both types of screwdrivers on different units. Power tools just to predrill makes it a breeze. I love the way the drawers look and on one unit I added my own knobs. They are more on the shallow side but really work great.;Looks great - Positive, requires power screwdriver - Neutral, shallower drawers - Neutral, added own knobs - Positive.

Great bookshelf. Perfect size for my needs. Easy to assemble.;Great bookshelf - Positive, Perfect size - Positive, Easy to assemble - Positive.
Great Look .. POOR Quality. I purchased the EKET because of the smaller footprint/sleeker design compared to the KALLAX. Unfortunately, the unit we purchased did not align properly and cracked during assembly. We exchanged the unit assuming this was just a lemon but had another issue when assembling our second EKET. This unit did not crack but no matter how hard we could not get the boards to 'click' in place. We really wanted to like this product but the quality/ease of assembly just wasn't there.;Small footprint - Positive, sleek design - Positive, poor quality - Negative, did not align properly - Negative, cracked during assembly - Negative.
