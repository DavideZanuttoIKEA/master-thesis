20423720,Extra shelves. These extra shelves make waisted space not waisted. 
20275814,White cubes. This unit works great for TV components and radio speakers. Plus the baskets hide all accessories underneath the components. 
40409935,Bookshelf. All my extra books fit on the shelves. The baskets help hold the extra stuff that won’t look nice exposed. 
80275887,"Kallax. Nice clean look, sturdy and easy to put together"
10391041,Great bookshelves. We bought 4 of these and made a library wall with them. Looks great and holds lots of books.
80275887,Love this product!. This product is the perfect solution for my small space
20213312,Great for my plants. Instructions can be confusing but the shelf is a great price and perfect for my plants.
00415599,White Kallax Shelves. These shelves are perfect! I bought the 9 cubbie and the 4 cubbie and put them side by side in my closet. They look so nice and professional. They provide so much extra storage. I will probably buy more for the upstairs closet as well. I hired the Task Rabbit to put them together and that was a great experience. Thank you IKEA for such a nice product.
50481172,Easy to assemble.. Easy to assemble.
60221683,Finally no MDF!. Finally no MDF!
10275862,"Cost Cutting Garbage, ignore Older Reviews. I bought one of these guys in 2015 and it went together like a breeze - its still standing after being moved across the state several times. This one I got in 2024 - EVERY shelf piece is hollow with their cardboard honeycomb stuff inside (formerly plywood) and MUCH thinner wall structure on each piece. The shelves flexed so badly it doesn't slot together and leaves huge gaps, plus we knocked a hole into the side panel of it with a soft rubber mallet trying to get it lined up. And yet, Ikea has the gall to charge more for it? Spare me, please."
60221683,"Patience with the assembly pays off.. I ordered two of these for my living space. The units are solid and seem durable. However, patience is key in getting these assembled in a way that the vertical supports don't torque themselves into alignments that aren't squared up in the corners. Get all four vertical pieces barely attached, and then go around tightening each corner a few turns at a time under all are fully tightened. It'll take longer this way but you'll be happier with the end result. If you tighten them one by one you'll find that the vertical supports won't square up well, and you'll end up having to undo them all to correct the problem. Slow and steady wins this race."
60221683,"Very sturdy and sleek. Super easy to assemble, sturdy materials and construction.  I love how thin looking the shelves are: makes all your items really pop out.  Being able to choose the shelves spacing is a plus.  Sturdy enough for large books."
60221683,"Minimal & pleasing storage solution. Love this shelf! It allows a lot more light into a dark room, has ample storage, & is very sturdy. It has a clean, classic look that is very minimalist.   It does require two people to build, but with lockdown I had to build it alone. So I used thick books as risers to stabilize the pieces as I was building and it was a huge success — with no bowing or any issues.  Could not be happier with this shelf. If only the smaller version was not discontinued! Wish I had more space so more space so I could get another one."
89442641,Love it. Exactly what I wanted. Looks great and easy to assemble. 
80275887,Love it!! . I love this product! It does exactly what I need it to do! 
89442617,"Impressive for the price. These are mass produced, user assembled shelves. The finished shelf is surprisingly good looking with clean lines and a nice finish. Assembly is pretty easy and the elements fit very well. "
90562166,Easy to assemble. Modern sleek look.. Wish the back panel was more stable and secure. 
80275887,"It fits perfectly under my windows when placed horizontally. I needed a low bookcase to place under my living room windows to organize books, handwork, and various ""stuff"" in our small apartment to eliminate clutter.  Placed horizontally with no additional frame or legs it fits perfectly.  I have room to display houseplants on the top.   I have four Knipsa storage baskets placed on the bottom four cubby holes which work great and look very nice.    Our furniture is  mostly in traditional wood tones but the white looks clean and bright under the windows which have white plantation shutters and woodwork.  All in all I find this purchase a good value for our purposes, and it was easy to assemble.   Our"
29336356,Annoying af. It took me almost 2 hours or more to try to get this to line up or to even get the door on. These are the WORST directions ever. Ended up throwing it out my back door and cracked into peices fuck this box
00275848,"Love Kallax. I have about 10+ in my house, they are in my craft room mainly, they can hold so much! Love them"
50481172,Does not go together AT ALL. The screws didn't fit into the legs
49481658,"Perfect sewing table!. I am using it as a sewing table. Instead of having the shelf upright, I laid it on its side and I have an L-shaped sewing table. The table is study enough for sewing and I have canvas storage bins underneath to hide materials."
20275814,Great product. I love this line of product I have been able to setup my art studio with this cube system and I continue to find ways to add more for storage and functionality.
80275887,"Perfect Craftroom Storage. These Kallax pieces are beautiful, easy to assemble, sturdy enough to hold a great deal of paper and perfect for organizing!"
40423719,"Awesome. This holds my 12x12 scrapbook papers! I love it! I purchased 4, wish I had purchased more! IKEA is 4 hours away, so I will have to wait to buy more!"
00275848,"Perfect Craftroom Storage. These Kallax pieces are sturdy, easy to assemble and beautiful. I have never been disappointed!"
70286645,"Nice addition to shelves. My wife loves that I got this for her shelves. It’s a nice touch.   Overall, assembly went smoothly."
79278269,"Perfect for 12”vinyl albums. If you want a great shelf to store your albums, look no further. These are the best."
00324518,Well made. I love this. Turned it long and used as tv stand
50214678,"some amateur design, but cheaper than most. Not IKEA's finest assembly procedure or fit+finish, but well priced for the appearance of the final product.  * Super-annoying adhesive on stickers on the frame has to be scrubbed off. No clean peel... * Mis-drilled side piece meant either skipping one set of screws or skipping the stiffening plates (I did the former) * No wall attach kit despite recommendation to attach to wall. Note you'll need less common 2"" screws if you're using anchors. * Poor fit: gaps between shelves and frame. * Wooden shelves don't have pre-drilled holes and the laminate is too tough for the tiny wood screws. You're going to ALSO need a drill to pre-drill (not in instructions).  Looks nice enough when done but twice as annoying as expected. Feels like some designer's first project and he doesn't have his own place so never assembles furniture.  I wouldn't buy another. "
70301542,Kallak shelves are excellent.. We have 5 of these shelving units in our house.  My wife uses them for her art supplies.  They were delivered to my house and brought upstairs.  Assembly is easy.  Great units.
80556236,Worst Ikea product ever. I understand that it is chip so I anticipated some issues with qualities. But assembling the product is a nightmare because it requires some tricks to attach the last wall to complete the shelf. I gave up and carefully used a resin-head hummer to finish the ugly gaps. At the end I smashed it leaving some cracks on the outside. Goes to garbage.
79294542,Not stable . Put together the unit but it still seems loose? Also mounting screws were not included 
20275814,"Strong. Strong, sturdy, easy to build, looks good."
90428842,Size. A little bit too small...
20275814,"I purchased this to store. I purchased this to store my teaching materials in my home office. It’s perfect for what I needed it for. My husband was able to put it together without difficulty or complaint. I have since purchased another for my home office and two more to hold books. I’m using these to replace an old shelving unit. They’re sturdy, nice looking, & easy to move around! These are great!"
80275887,"Perfect Shelving for Craft Room. Bought 3 of these, stacked them and anchored them and they work great in my wife's craft room. They are very sturdy, not too hard to put together either."
59902658,"Great shelves!. The website picture is a little misleading, I thought I was getting a triple unit not a double and a single. But either way, I’m happy with my shelves, they’re definitely more sturdy than my old plant shelves, and more aesthetically pleasing!"
49442676,"Instructions clearly not written to go together- look at BOTH!!. Love the unit, but I’m extremely irritated that the instructions for the shelving unit say nothing about the underframe requiring four of the larger bolts from the unit to come out so the brackets can be installed. That information is in the instructions for the underframe. I have problems with dexterity and am none too happy about doing the work of getting those bolts in securely just to turn around and have to do it again. Also would have appreciated one of the screwdrivers with 90 degree bends for getting the underframe screws in. Otherwise, lovely storage unit. Tip over hardware is a lot better than the old plastic kits and the wide variety of inserts add more functionality."
80487813,"Cute & Functional. I love my shelf so much. My uncle painted the frame part pink to match my kitchen decor. I use it to free up space on my countertops. I put my little white retro style microwave on it, my pink toaster and pink bubblegum machine filled with chocolates. I also put 2 pans (pink of course) on the bottom shelf. I’m very pleased with my purchase."
20275885,Great. Provided just the storage needed in my office.
30275861,Kallax Unit is perfect. I bough a large Kallax and it is perfect for storage in my closet under the stairs.
20275885,It serves its purpose.. modern. It serves its purpose.. modern style furniture in the office or at home.
00415599,Great addition to my living room. I bought 2 of these units and put them side by side for a base for the tv. Very easy to put together. Added a lot of depth to my living room!
20278167,Difficult instructions. The instructions are difficult to understand. The door doesn’t close very well. Flimsy
10409932,Superior cubicles!. So much nicer than any others I’ve ever had. Easy to assemble! Great hardware and instructions. Love the way they are attached to the wall! Highly recommended.
60275812,Great little shelf. I love it. I just wish it had a back but that's my issue. Item is solid and well made and did just what I needed.
00415599,Excellent room divider. Using this piece as a room divider/display case in front of my linnmon desk.
79442694,"Good Shelves. The shelves work well, accessories like cubes, doors and drawers make the unit more versatile.   Finding one was a different story, had to watch the website like a hawk."
20275814,Perfect for my purpose.. Simple and straight forward assembly. Sturdy and nice quality. Went back and bought a second one.
80401292,Works great. This wine rack works prefect. Actually thing of buying a second. Would be great if Ikea could make a wine grass holder for the Kallax cube.
20275814,"Sturdy, sleak, and stylish. This. Sturdy, sleak, and stylish. This is a great buy and provided great storage in my house."
10324513,Great shelving unit. I love this unit. Great color. Took forever to order due to the leg base being out stock. Well worth the wait!
20275814,"Salon Furniture. Needed a shelf that worked for storage and a usable top space. Has options to make closed cabinets and shelves to hold retail. Great product, made well and sustainably. Also a quarter of the price of actual salon furniture."
79442694,Great Vinyl Album Storage. This cabinet is perfect for storing my vinly album collection. The cabinet looks great in the media room.
50481172,"Love It. I have a small room so organization is key to me. This was easy to assemble, it doesn't take up a lot of space, and it's great for organizing."
29442677,"Beautiful, functional, and affordable . Easy to assemble. The additional drawer or cabinet door cubbie inserts (purchased separately) make this unit customizable."
79278293,Study shelving. I used two of these stacked with a two opening unit on top to create a vinyl & CD storage in my music room. The shelves are very sturdy and fit vinyl perfectly. The four drawers hold lots of CDs.
60278170,"These were not as great. These were not as great as I wanted them to be. As with the drawers, which I love. These also have to be screwed into the shelves and are permanent"
10305741,These bookcases look great in. These bookcases look great in my apartment. I needed more space for books and knickknacks and these are perfect. I had a little help with building them. Thy were affordable and really do the job.
40275846,Love it - sturdy. I love the Kallax because it is so simple and incredibly sturdy.
80275887,Love this!. I love the quality of this. It was relatively easy to assemble and it’s solid. Great value and definitely recommend. The only thing that I might like to see would be an option for a back to enclose the compartments to use as a cubby system instead of shelves. I like these better than other bookshelves because they don’t wobble when put together.
60275812,"Kallax. I've had all sizes of the Kallax storage units.  I've combined them, in all sizes, like a puzzle to fill a whole wall.  Be sure to tether if you do that.  They fit most decorative styles.  "
39442686,"Beautiful. This might be my favorite piece in my office. I’ve used the bottom cubes for storage bins, the top cubes for display cases, and the top shelf for books and plants. It is being used as a divider to section off a large room and it’s the perfect piece for the space."
80487813,"The unit is working well. The unit is working well in my kitchen. Assembly was okay and it looks good in the location I chose for it. I wish the shelves had the option to be adjustable, but that's not a huge deal."
80275887,Baggebo. Looks amazing in my bedroom .
50481172,"A Staple!. I got 2 of these shelves and adore them. They're stable, sturdy, and easy to put together by yourself. I would also imagine they're easy to paint over for a different look. I would buy another!  One tip for assembly is to just lightly hand screw everything in before tightening them all the way in the final step! Otherwise, sometimes the holes don't align properly :)"
90428842,"Cute but not easy!. These cubes are very cute and practical but the fact that Ikea sells them as easy to assemble baffles the mind. I have done several of these at this point and there hasn't been a single one that hasn't required some light hammering (which risks ruining the board) or basically me just accepting that one of the sides will be slightly off-kilter. Every single product I have bought from Ikea that required actual tools to assemble (including a kitchen cabinet!) has been easier to assemble in comparison/proportionately speaking. Like I said, they are cute though, and a practical solution for some awkward storage needs around the house, so it's a good bang for the buck as long as you take the video on the website with a grain of salt."
60275812,Record storage. Works great for what we bought it for
70286645,Nifty accessory. This works beautifully in the Kallax. It is a lot more sturdy and natural looking when it’s installed in the unit. It looks like it was built that way — almost seamless so to speak.
30275861,"an organizational workhorse. the Kallax holds books, papers, artifacts...the list is too long to mention. It is at once classic and contemporary, the shelves are strong and don't sag, no matter how full and heavy. It can be infinitely re-imagined. It has a substantial presence but not heavy looking, always stylish with clean lines that never go out of style."
80487813,Easy assembly. This was perfect for my need: a closet shelf for towels and misc stuff. I did not need to secure it to wall. Sparks joy!
80487813,Easy to put together but flimsy. I ended up returning because I purchased the tall version and needed the short. I’m an IKEA evangelist but I’d say this is probably twice as expensive as it should be. It’s easy to put together but seems very flimsy. I didn’t end up buying the shorter one.
30275861,Love. Love these cubby holes to help keep things organized
09481684,"Love it!. I made this desk in 45 min. It was extremely easy to build with the instructions. Just make sure you don’t miss a step! And I was able to do it all by myself. Had it built before my husband got home 🤣 and I loved the packaging, it was minimal but efficient. So we didn’t have boxes for days!"
80487813,"Poorly-aligned holes in uprights made for a miserable assembly experience.. You'd think that drilling holes down the center of a strip of wood would be relatively easy for a manufacturer to do well -- but this shelving unit shows that IKEA is not up to the task. The holes in the uprights were sometimes centered and sometimes not, and in one case this required a bit of home woodworking (using far more in the way of tools than came in the boxes) to correct. If the price were half of what it is, I might not gripe too much -- but for this price, it's completely inexcusable for IKEA's factory to be so incredibly sloppy. It's also important to note that these shelves look to be solid slabs in the product photos, but are actually made of thin sheets of metal wrapped into square tubes at the front and back -- this means that they sag when weight is put anywhere other than the ends, front, or back of the shelves."
20275814,Easy assembly and looks great!. Easy assembly and looks great!
40409935,Great Storage piece . This shelf is the perfect storage piece and looks great in my space.
20409936,Easy assembly and great storage . I have Purchased kallax multiple times since IKEA came to Canton. 
20275885,"Versatile . I love these Kallax furniture pieces, they’re super versatile, you can use the as a book case, as drawers for your clothes, as a storage organizer, as a display, or even a TV stand! We have five and rotate them for different uses!"
49285817,Great use of space. . Excellent storage.
80275887,"awesome product. I  love the ease of putting it together, it looks cool too and I would say Awesome product in a very reasonable price. Now I have almost 5 of these . Thank you"
50481172,"Baggebo shelf. My teen loves this shelf! We have had Kallax for storage in his room a long time, but he has been asking for shelving to display smaller items. I saw the Baggebo in store and knew he would love it. He did and put two together himself and arranged his favorite things just the way he wanted. This was a perfect solution at a price we could afford."
70301542,Perfect for vinyl record storage. Must mount it though. This is perfect for my album collection. I used metal wall anchors from the hardware store to mount all four corners to the wall. I have about 900 vinyl albums and this holds them perfectly. As always follow the directions. Assembling on a carpet using a level are important. I also added wood glue to all the dowels so they stay solid. 
40334558,Made a cute little table . Added the legs and it’s a cute little side table in my son’s room. Perfect height for his low chair. He’s 8. 
70483274,Very hard to put together . There are a lot of defective problems. It's very hard to put together.
49481700,Perfect for my crafting space. Perfect for my crafting space
40346924,"Great Kallax Storage. Great Coloring, easy to assemble and gives wonderful storage!"
20275885,"Bought two. Love this. I bought two of them, turned them on their side and stacked them.  Looks great, really sturdy."
80275887,Just what I was looking for. Purchased to create a closet island for my newly renovated walk-in closet.
20454504,"Excellent small storage space. Great small piece of furniture on wheels.  Easy to assemble.  In one room it’s a plant stand with space for indoor gardening gadgets.  In another it’s a night table.  Love it so much, I bought a second one. "
40501892,Love it!. I love this stand for my Kallax shelf. It lifts it off of the floor and makes it look so much better. It’s very sturdy and easy to assemble. I going to buy more for my other rooms.
70301537,Perfect for my Scrapbooking organizing. I love the space I have with the larger cubbies! So many different ways to organize and so many options! I’m very pleased with this unit!
89442641,Great and Versatile Bookshelf . Bought these for my home office and they look great.  They were easy to put together and because of their size I can move them around as needed. 
90495695,"Huge Disappointment!!! Doesn't fit- too large!!. Very disappointed with these - they don't fit.  I picked these up with some other items in Renton yesterday - a 110 mile drive from me. Got home with them and they don't fit - they are too large to insert into the cubicle.  I have 2 different Kallax units - one is a 20 cubicle unit, the other an 8 cubicle unit - these will not fit into any cubicle in either of the units!!!  According to the sticker on these inserts they were manufactured (?) in Poland 2021-11-08. I saw another reviewer say that theirs were too big too. What happened to quality control??? I don't make a drive that far on a regular basis so, I'm stuck with the useless things since I won't pay shipping to return them.  Shouldn't have happened - very disappointed."
90495695,Doesn’t fit the kallax shelf. I purchased it thinking it would fit in the shelf like the reviews and description said but it don’t. It too big for the shelf space and annoying trying to fit. Easy to put together but useless because I can’t fit it in the shelf just sitting in my home collecting dust
70301537,Gift to Myself . I love it!I can put books and my fave things in it.
70301537,"Perfect storage. I have two of these, one in my classroom, the other in my closet. The Drona squares fit perfectly, but so do baskets and other storage as needed."
70301537,Wonderful storage. This is a wonderful piece of furniture for any sewing studio or craft room.   I use my Kallax units for storing fabrics wrapped around comic book boards. It’s deep enough for two rows of fabric in each cubby. I use the dröna fabric baskets in my Kallax to store quilting kits and fabric stabilizers.   I’d highly recommend the Kallax in any size!
70339291,"Great shelf for books & small TV. This works perfectly for books, baskets, and a smaller TV on the top shelf in a bedroom. Was easy to assemble."
59902658,"Great Product, But Disappointed. This shelving unit is absolutely beautiful and did not seem difficult to assemble - I hired a worker from Task Rabbit so I don't know for sure. However, I was so disappointed to find out that this particular item is just two units, one double width and a single width, put very close together. It is not one big unit. With so many combinations you can make from these units, I have no idea why this is the only one that is sold together, it's very misleading. I also had mine delivered so didn't realize until I had them in my home. I decided to return the single width unit and buy another double width one."
59902658,"elegant and sturdy storage solution. I already had three of the single shelves, and when I bought my house I added these additional pieces to make a full wall for books. It almost looks built in, and it's a gorgeous focal point for my books and records."
59902658,"Love the low profile. I wouldn't have thought from the description that these metal shelves would have such a low profile, but after seeing them at a friends house I was sold.  They are solid and the glass definitely makes them easy on the eye. Would buy again!"
70339291,Love It. We bought theFajallbo shelving unit. We love it! It’s stylish and sturdy.
70301542,Nice product. I would love to see them add a way to secure them to each other on the sides but over all it looks great.
59902658,Quality and design. This book case is well made and easy to assemble. It also looks fantastic and elevates the space it's in. Highly recommended.
79294523,Beautiful Display Shelf. This shelf is perfect for our little bodycare boutique. Great price for the quality. Assembly is a little tricky if your not use to putting furniture together. OVERALL...love it! Thank you IKEA!
70301537,"Kallax. Love this unit, in fact I have several of them. If you have children, please anchor them. They are heavy and easy to put together."
59278307,Entryway storage . Bought this to store shoes and items at the front door entryway. Very functional and stylish. Hubby put it together quickly. 
00388633,Looks great with Havsta glass door cabinet. Great addition to the cabinet. We have 4 of these (using 2 on each side of glass door cabinet. Nice sturdy construction. Made with solid wood - not compressed particle board. All together with cabinet and 4 of these towers fills 12 foot wall great!
49481700,"Does the job . Got this for a study workstation, and it’s perfect. Fits the space, is pretty sturdy, and looks good."
59442628,Easy to assemble . Very easy to assemble good quality!
89294532,"great shelving units. I saw these in a photo and they looked like what I wanted. I ordered and could not be happier with them. They are sturdy, well built, look great and most of all very easy to assemble."
50305739,Glossy and great. The glossy white Kallax is one of those IKEA pieces that is such a great price point for how modern it feels. The 4 square version was easy to put together solo. And I paired it next to a larger one I bought years ago. This is a great extension that was in budget and looks seamless. Highly rec. and go glossy — it’s the best of all the colors
59278307,"Love it!. Clean lines, great configuration for my purposes"
09442720,"The Best for my Craft Room. I put this off for years but finally with an update of flooring was forced to organize my craft room.  I chose the Kallex to be the main form of storage and love the pieces I bought!  the 16 unit wall shelving piece plus the pieces to divide several of the areas for paper, and other supplies are perfect.  It was much quicker to install than I expected and now only after a couple of days, I realize how silly my procrastination actually was.  I should have done this years ago!!!  "
19442692,Worked perfectly for the storage. Worked perfectly for the storage closet
70286645,The best options. I was looking for something nice and elegant for my spa 🧖🏼‍♀️ and it really is how I wanted it
20213312,"Perfection. I waited MONTHS for Vittsjo to come back in stock, and I am so glad I didn't give up and purchase something elsewhere. To get a similar look elsewhere will cost ~$300. This shelf unit is GORGEOUS – modern, clean lines, simple, well-constructed, sturdy. I do wish the holes in the top and bottom wood slabs were pre-drilled, but it wasn't too difficult to do it ourselves. We also didn't receive enough padding stickers for the glass, so we improvised. I can't say enough good things about this unit otherwise."
89294532,"Awesome shelves. We use these for plants, books, games and display items. They’re so versatile and surprisingly sturdy. Love how the light can flow down through the shelves"
50481172,Great but.... The shelf is great. Bought it to use for bathroom storage and it fits perfectly. I took off one star because it was way to hard to assemble. Would have been great if Ikea had made the screws for adult sized hands!
90286649,"Easy to assemble. And hold. Easy to assemble. And hold more than I expected. Turned an 11 year old shelf into something new with the drawers.  Please note - you do have to screw in the insert, so they are permanent."
80334603,"NOT difficult to assemble!. Lots of reviews saying these are difficult to assemble. They are not. You just have to follow the instruction of leaving the panel labelled “1” on the bottom throughout the entire assembly. The groove in panel one is significantly deeper than the grooves in the other panels. This allows the piece that slides in the back to sit lower so that you’re able to pop in the last panel without any resistance. Again, just leave the panel labeled “1” on the floor (or table if you’re assembling on a table surface) and you should be fine.  **I did struggle until I realized my mistake. Once I figured out that I wasn’t following the instructions properly, these cubes assembled in about a minute and a half. "
60333954,"Good size for my needs. Easy to assemble!!!. I bought two white Ekets 2 x 2 as the size was good for my needs. When I was reading the reviews, I was in a doubt if I can assemble it myself properly. Luckily, I found on Youtube a video instruction, how to do it ""ikea eket instruction part 2"". I even didn't use the paper instruction. Both pieces were assembled perfectly!!! Thank you Ikea and the person who did these video instructions."
20454504,Mr bub . My husband loves this little cart
60333954,"Don’t give up like I almost did!!!. Writing this review to help people who had trouble like me. I spent over an hour trying to align the pieces to fit, I even searched for tutorials on YouTube, and couldn’t find one for this specific model. Was very frustrated and was about to send all 4 of my Eket back to where they come from.   I took them apart and I realized the fault is not the product, it’s in the instructions. All the side boards should be numbered from 1-4, not just the first board. Essentially you would connect number one first with the sides and the pieces inside, and at the VERY END, the last piece should be the board opposite from number 1. If your last piece is the ones on the side of number 1, you will never get it to align. It took me less than 5 minutes to finish each one doing it this way, which is to follow the pictures to a tee. But Ikea should modify the instructions to be more specific and fool proof and number each side boards.   It looks beautiful and perfectly aligned when done!"
19442654,easy to assemble.. looks great
50334591,Basic storage gets the job done. Cubes give lots of configuration options. Seem like good quality and easy to assemble. 
90286649,I love these drawers. Adding the drawers made the shelves more organized. I love the look it gives to the unit and it was so easy to put together.
60275812,Looks so much better. This looks so much better than the old bookcase we were using.
10409932,Love it. Makes my sewing room very organized
70286645,So awesome. The drawers slide smooth and it looks great in my Kallax
00415599,It’s good quality and perfect. It’s good quality and perfect for what I needed.
49442676,Perfect fit!. I bought this as a tv stand for the guest room. I added storage cubes below and put books and a few other decorative items on the top row. The additional stand was a great addition to give it a nice touch.
49189203,"Putting together was a pain. Its so difficult to put together for something that's just supposed to ""snap together"". the plastic attachment grooves on the sides don't work nor fit together perfectly so a part of the sides don't lay flat with each other. Had to literally use a rubber mallet to force things to fit better. And even then they didn't line up correctly. Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is bc the assembly was the only problem I've had with it everything else was fine I guess.. "
40311873,"Is exactly what you expect . It’s fine, a bit expensive, but functional"
90286649,Great product. These drawers are much nicer than expected.  They went together relatively easy and having the metal bearing slides make them very smooth in operation.  I even bought another set.
80487813,Missing the frame….. I bought this shelf 2 weeks ago. I tried to set it up today and figured out the frame part was missing. Is this shelf including 2 parts? So upset about it. ☹️
40423719,Perfect for puzzles. I use the Kallax shelf to organize my child’s play area and this insert is absolutely perfect for storing all of her wooden puzzles! 
00275848,Kallax single row. Ordered the Kallax single row. It a great way to store vinyls. Regular size vinyls fit perfectly. Putting unit together was easy and quick. Very satisfied with purchase. Would highly recommend. 
60275812,"My new favorite IKEA furniture. This thing is great!  It's super easy to put together, and thanks to the various inserts it's also a very versatile piece of shelving.  I added the pedestal on the bottom so that I could place it over an air conditioning vent."
60275812,Perfect size. Purchased to clean up a corner that I wa using for storage. Looks and works great
60275812,Easy. Simple to build simple to use very sturdy absolutely love extra storage
60324520,"It serves a purpose. It serves a purpose for storage, but i think the materials are too cheap. When we were putting together our KALLAX cubes, it didn’t line up perfectly despite our careful attention to building instructions. Now the shelves don’t shut correctly and it bothers me for the price and time spent trying to build it. There’s just something not right about the way the material looks and feels. It looked better online than in person. Not satisfied sadly "
90495695,"Needs sanding. This would not fit my kallax shelves properly and I needed to sand down two sides to make it fit, but otherwise it’s great!"
50454507,"Rolling Shelf Unit. Love the small and very well made rolling shelf to store things in my craft room! Easy to put together, too!"
10409932,Perfect for organization. Bought this item to organize my twins’ toys. Setup was a breeze. Purchase two sets of drawer inserts as well. Looks amazing in our playroom. Definitely recommend.
40423719,Paper storage. This is a great insert- perfect for storing cardstock inside the kallax units. 
50305739,Installed in closet. These are really nice and durable in closet
80275887,"Hacked the Use. Instead of purchasing a closet system, I used two of the Kallax units to rework a walk in closet. Standing, this particular configuration fits under the existing hanging clothes rack. I place a second Kallax on the other wall in a horizontal position. I can now hang cloths, neatly arrange folded sweaters and jeans, and have more room than ever before."
00314642,"Cheaply made, Flimsy. These used to be made much better. They are terrible now. I wrote another review under the inserts with the doors that goes into more detail, but essentially, these used to be decent, but now they are little more than cardboard, with a laminated particleboard front. Very disappointing."
70286645,"Terrible quality. I have an older Kallax shelf with several drawer units. The drawer enclosures are made from actual wood. These pieces of garbage barely qualify as cardboard. They are flimsy and arrived RIPPED. And i now realize I am writing a review using the word ""ripped"" when describing a drawer enclosure."
00314642,"So disappointing!. We bought this newer version of the Kallax, after having owned the older version (c. 90s-2000s.) This was very, very disappointing. Extremely cheaply made. Would never hold up to continued regular use. We were expecting the same quality we used to get from Ikea products. This is not anywhere near the quality of the Ikea products we used to purchase!"
70286645,Units are great but all arrived damaged. Units are great but all arrived damaged and I do not have a local Ikea store to return them to. 
70301542,"Space saving, beautiful. Used this to replace a dresser in a small house, wish we saw it sooner! Able to organize and save space! Still have ample room on it for more. The doors and drawers are fantastic.  Easy to put together , Even for this old person!"
50339292,"Awesome. It is good quality, and not tightening all the bolts in the assembly, makes making mistakes so much easier to take apart"
70332124,Beware. Doesn't come with mounting brackets and didn't find out until I got home. Mounting brackets are not available anywhere either.
90428842,impossible to assembly. This is one of the only products I have bought at IKEA in over 20 years that I had to return. I just couldn't get the joints to be clean as pictured.
20510864,"Impossible to assemble. These are really nice looking, but were impossible to put together. The peg holes weren't machined enough to fit the pegs properly. We returned them."
90428842,cant assemble. awful
70332124,Impossible to assemble as instructions. Impossible to assemble as instructions show. Looks horrible from corner/ends. Wasted of money and time
60221683,Excellent . Big space 
70286645,"I had the old ones that were made of solid materia.. This new design is awful unfortunately. It’s flimsy, and requires you to make holes and damage the bookcase. Wish I could return it. Disappointing"
59552914,"Frame needs to be attached to unit. So disappointed in this--you just set the shelving unit on top of the underframe, which means it just wobbles around.  There needs to be a way to attach the frame to the shelving. "
80275887,"Unbelievably Cheap. I know IKEA is the place to buy affordable furniture. We purchased one of these for our young daughter years ago (maybe 2015 or 2016), and it has held up to her, her friends, and one across the country. We just bought another one for a closet, but this time, the quality is significantly lesser. I don't know if the shelves are made of foam, or what, but they are so light that they float/glide across each other when stacking. I'd estimate that each shelf weighs less than a ream of paper. We're desperate and we live far away from an IKEA so we'll keep it, but honestly, it is just so cheap I don't know if I'll go back for the 4 shelf Kallax that is delayed due to quality issues (according to the salesperson). This can't possibly be good for the environment."
10487816,Impossible to assemble. This would have been a nifty little shelf if only one could assemble it. Holes of uneven size and not deep enough for screws or dowels to fit or be tightened properly. The pieces that I put together kept falling apart so it was impossible to build because one couldn't get the frame to stay put long enough to attach the shelves.
40423719,Kallax accessories . Helped me organize my craft papers 
40423719,"Love it. I use it to hold things think they are tiny drawers. I craft so it holds my paper cutters, stamp positioner, and anything large that needs to be stored flats"
40423719,"Paper storage. I like stacking my papers vertically, it's perfect. The unit does  take up some space on 2 sides of the cube, I use job tickets/dry erase folders for my paper projects, they are 13"" tall so don't fit in these, but 12X12 papers fit perfectly."
90495695,"Tight fit, but great for shoes. I knocked off a star due to how difficult it was to get them inserted into an already built Kallax unit. I would recommend inserting at time of Kallax build, before final tightening of all the bolts. That said, they are great for dividing the squares on the Kallax. I have a 4x4 square unit in my closet and installed four of these along the bottom row. It allows me to neatly store 4 pairs of shoes in each Kallax square."
40423719,Hobby Supplies Storage. It’s not easy finding storage that is deep enough for my 12x 12 scrapbook paper. Kallax fits it perfectly! And the various inserts make each cube customizable for other items I need to store for my hobbies.
40423719,Just what I was looking for!. I love my Kallax layered shelves. They fit perfectly in my shelving unit. They were so easy to put together without any tools. I use them to stack cardstock in my craft room. I couldn’t be happier. I need to buy more!
40423719,"Great slots. This worked really well for the purpose I had. Plenty sturdy enough for folders, little piles of papers and such."
69442642,Kallax. So sad not to have my Expedit as an option. These are ok but the others were far superior (I had them over a decade and 3 major moves). My recommendation is based sadly on the fact that there is no longer the previous version. The base is a good option to have however it is waaay too tall.
90286649,"Well designed, easy to install. Very versatile piece of furniture.  These drawer inserts are easy to put together and install.  A little bit of wood glue on the dowels and in the slots helps make these drawers just that much sturdier"
70286645,Great Product. Great Product
30530574,"Eket cube. They don’t go together as easily as they should. Plastic tabs broke off easily on 2 of the 8 I purchased.  On the other hand, super easy to mount straight on the wall. "
20275885,fabulous. This holds records and 3 ring binders gorgeously. So love the options for it too.
00334536,"Easy Assembly / Great for Vinyl or Other Shelving. Didn't take me long to put these together (I ordered two for giving myself room to expand my ever-growing vinyl collection). Very little tools needed for assembling, and it's great for why I need it. A little tricky getting everything to line up, but once you do, it just pretty much slides into place and is very sturdy."
30495599,Excellent add on to kallax. Excellent add on to kallax products
80275887,Love it!!!. Very sturdy and well made. I was actually surprised at the nice quality. Easy to assemble. Looks very nice in my space.
90495695,Shelf insert. Perfect way to organize vinyl crafting rolls.
50483289,Looks nice. This piece coordinated nice with the Kallax shelf that I purchased. Love that it has the back panel
10409932,this one is my favorite. trying to find other places in my home to use
19931865,"Elegant steel shelves. I bought a set of these 10 years ago and just bought another. You can't tell them apart, they have held up so well. For steel shelves, they are very elegant and suitable for a living room or anywhere. The wide drawers work well, but due to the width you don't want to put anything too heavy in them."
30275861,"Kallax forever. Of course Kallax is the best deal on the planet for storing vinyl LPs, but it can do so much more. Having 4x4 or 5x5 cubes to work with is liberating, and enables you to put things that go together in the same cube, instead of having to find wherever something will fit (where you'll never find it)."
00275848,"Turns small spaces into dense storage. This is perfect for small areas between other things, what might otherwise be wasted space becomes 4 spacious cubes for clothes, toys, whatever. Also helps with de-cluttering because a cube can contain the sort of things like alarm clocks or a jewelry box that you would normally think has to take up valuable space on top of a bedside table or dresser."
20278167,"These are great!. They are different from the ones we got several years ago….more cheaply made, but they work the same."
80275887,Great storage unit!. Great storage unit!
40346924,Love the new color. We got this for the playroom to hold the grandkid's toys and it works great. We purchased some of the Drona fabric cartons to hold more items. Very pleased with the look and the size of this product.
50481172,We love these. Just what we needed for a greenhouse project! Also easily assembled- always a plus
60221683,"Almost 5 ⭐️. Solid build. I like the unit but received one of the frame rusty. Tried some elbow grease and some solution with no luck, so I had that portion facing to the wall. I read almost all the reviews before buying, didn’t expect that I would come across with the same issue with other reviewers. Still a good unit."
60333954,"Ruined my life. I’ve never experienced such frustration in my life. We had four people trying to put this together in turns for over 4 hours and still could not do it. It is the bane of my existence. The amount of agony and trauma I have gone through is unparalleled. I’ve bought previous IKEA furniture and I’ve never had this issue before. Please, for everyone’s sanity, don’t buy this. Even when finished there’s no sense of accomplishment, just more pain. We spent so long, agonized every step of the way, and for what? This piece of junk? It doesn’t even look that good. For the amount of effort it takes, it is not worth it."
50481172,"Sturdy, fits in small spaces. Great item to create shelf in narrow spaces"
30275861,Kallax Shelves. These worked out really well in our bathroom.
10305741,"Love our Kallax. Great and versatile storage in my grandchildrens room. It fits perfectly on our IKEA tv console, making for the ideal solution to overflowing toy boxes. We will eventually add some drawer and door inserts."
59442666,Use it as a bench for the mudroom. It fits perfectly with the DIY mudroom project. 
90495596,"Base does not actually attach to Kallax unit. Looks great with the raised base, but Ikea should really note in the product information that the base does not attach to the Kallax unit, so you have to anchor to the wall.  It would still be nice to attach the base to the storage unit somehow."
20275885,"Good quality, fair price. It's a good quality shelf- second time buying one."
00501889,"Look nice but they sag under load. I have several of these under some 4x2 and 4x4 Kallax shelves. They add a nice look by raising the shelves up off the floor. However, for being made of steel, they do sag a bit causing the entire shelf to sag a bit. It’s disappointing. There should be a set of legs at the midpoint to help support things. I’m going to have to find a way to add support."
20213312,"Easy assembly and fit perfectly. Purchased this shelf unit to fit within a small space and after the easy assembly it fit into that space like it was made for it.    Only criticism on assembly is for alignment of the pieces.  They did okay on the overall design, but it would work even better if you simply used screws that had a bit of an alignment collar.  Similar to a lug bolt on a car is used to help align the wheel to the hub.  These completely flat based screws makes you have to leave them all a little loose until all pieces are in place and then you can tighten and align as you go.  Not too difficult but still not as simple as it could be."
20213312,Best shelf for house plants!!. Great shelf for house plants 
20213312,"Great piece, a bit wobbly. I’ve waited to be close enough to make an IKEA trip for this piece. I love how modern it looks and it was relatively easy to put together. Once assembled, it seems like it could use another set of the triangle braces that are provided for the first glass shelf on the bottom. I know it would mess with the aesthetic a bit, but I’m thinking about how I could brace it on my own.  It did NOT come with any wall hardware or pieces to attach to the wall. Since it sits out a bit with a baseboard, it would take a very long screw to get to the wall. I was expecting the plastic “zip tie” type anchors to be included."
70301537,"No screws to bolt to wall. For a shelving unit that depends on being bolted to the wall per IKEA’s instructions, they didn’t actually provide the screws needed to do it, nor do the instructions tell you at the beginning that you need said screw before you begin. We have a two-year-old, and so we panic-searched our house for something to bolt the shelf with before we had to pick him up from daycare. All the instructions had was a dotted outline of the screw with an absent product number (which all the included parts had throughout the pictures) to show you it wasn’t included in the materials provided, and that info only showed up at the back of the instruction book in the steps for bolting it to the wall. There was no notice at the beginning saying to be sure to buy the screws so you could ensure you had all materials before building the shelf. Frustrating as a parent, to say the least!"
30275861,"Some disadvantages compared to Expedit. So, it should go without saying that this is an iconic shelving unit and I'm glad to have it. That said, you asked for a review and the honest answer is: I'm quite disappointed. I had a 5 x 5 Expedit shelf unit and I expected Kallax to be very similar. First, after renting a truck to move the boxes, I discovered (in store) that the 5x5 Kallax unit has been sold out for months and that it was unlikely to be back in stock soon, in any color. I ended up opting to buy a 4x4 plus a 2x4 to make the room divider I needed. This is somewhat less than optimal because the Kallax has a wider edge than internal part. Another disadvantage of the Kallax units is that they have exposed hardware on the top of the unit, and drilled holes inside the sides of the shelves that are visible if you don't use the wall mounting hardware (which I don't, because I'm using the shelves as a room divider). Both of these features make the Kallax look less polished than the Expedit. Finally, I'm very disappointed that the door units must be drilled into the Kallax. I loved the Expedit door inserts in part because I could easily take them out and transfer them to a different block to change up the look. Now the units can't be moved, and they are much trickier to assemble. All in all, after having an Expedit, Kallax seems like more of a hassle, less polished, and less flexible."
60324520,"Fine small shelf unit. Well built, easy to assemble, attractive.  The large shelf spaces are functional for books of assorted sizes."
70301542,"Love the modularity. I love the look of the shelf unit, assembly was very easy, and the idea of modules which are drawers, cabinets, or baskets is pure genius. Unfortunately it is not very stable and I suspect that it will need bracing before too long for it not to collapse."
70301537,Super wobbly??. I just bought 2 of the 5x5 units and had them assembled by TaskRabbit... and they are VERY wobbly. This is a huge surprise as we had several of the older model and they were sturdy as rocks. Not sure if they were poorly assembled this time or if this is due to the newer model? Anyone else have this issue?
50339292,Great cabinet. Very pretty. Not difficult to put together.
20473593,Great. A little tricky to assemble (a lot of pieces are almost symmetrical and easy to install backwards) but once it's together it looks super sharp.
50339292,"Fits Everything I Intended. Holds a lot. Glad I finally found a place for our vinyls that I am completely ok with. Overall, I am happy with it."
50481172,"Easy to assemble, reasonable price. Was easy to assemble"
50481172,Small scale shelf. Smaller scale shelf great for storage and decorative organizing 
80303437,"Lovely Shelves to Display Plants. Shelves in front of 8' windows to display orchids and violets. Glass shelves allow light to lower levels. Overall, beautiful, easy to assemble except for one screw that was stripped upon arrival and was useless. Very happy with these shelves."
40501892,"Wrong size!. I realize it must be difficult to actually write on a website that a product is incompatible with another product, but Ikea has accomplished this. Neither the short or long leg sets I bought work with either of my Kallax units. Terrible. Buyer beware."
50214678,"Basic shelf. Some wobbliness, and the metal oddly enough is not as thick as my older versions!"
80275887,Great piece of furniture!. We gave this to our 13 year old son for Christmas to use as his entertainment center. It worked out beautifully! He LOVES it ❤️
49398678,"Exceptional Piece(s) of storage . I love everything about my new Kallax! It is great quality wood and was easy to assemble! I love it! I ordered online and was a little nervous about that, but it was delivered without any issues! Thanks Ikea!! We will definitely be back! "
10275862,Good bookcase. A little rockie. Not very sturdy. But great amount of storage.
30275861,"Great except…. Got for my sewing room to store fabric and it works great except it doesn’t line up evenly with the studs in an American home, nor does it line up with the height of our electric sockets, so it is hard to plug in stuff. But it was easy to assemble and it stores the fabric well "
99294560,Perfect in our guest room.. Perfect in our guest room. Looks great and holds lots of books
99294560,"Nice style. We've had this one for nearly a month, and it's definitely a good style. I wouldn't mind seeing an option for rectangular tall shelves for a larger display area. A couple inches wider on each shelf would've been perfect. However, it's sturdy and stylish and works well all together."
49307640,Great storage for vinyl. I was looking for something to display my vinyls and some statues/figures at the same time and these were a Great Wall mountable option.
00275848,Great window seat/book shelf. The product was very easy to assemble. Holds a generous amount of books.
60333954,"Awful!. I bought two of this thing, bc i had an od version of the same thing that I liked a lot, a kallax i think it was. Thought this was the same thing, but its completely different and MUCH worse. Harder to put together, doesnt actually connect with thing that looks like a longer bookshelf. Just a massive downgrade."
00334536,"Complete frustration . We bought 2 of  the eket cubbies to make a longer bookshelf. I loved the sleek look online and thought it would be a great addition to our home. We opened up the first box and started putting it together. It was much more difficult to figure out how to get it today because the directions absolutely suck. But, we finally figured it out. But to our dismay, one of the shelving holes were drilled too close together. We took the whole thing apart thinking that we messed something up, but we ended up right with the same problem. So we opened the next box and started putting it together only to have the exact same problem. Two with the exact same problem? I questioned my husband again if we screwed something up. He is convinced it’s a factory issue so back to ikea they go.  "
00324518,good. good
49442676,Love it . Quality all the way 
70301542,"A huge bummer. Nearly finished building it when one of the screws simply would not screw in so tried to turn it to try a different angle, and a bunch of the connecting wood pieces snapped and lodged inside the shelves, impossible to get out. So can't finish putting it together and wasted the $270. Just terrible."
70301537,"I couldn't imagine a poor quality shelf. I bought these shelves based on the many postitive reviews. I couldn't have been more dissappointed. The entire structural integrety is on small wooden dowels. The shelves do not support themselves, let alone put anything on them.  Based on this product alone, Sweeden should not be allowed into NATO."
70301542,"Cardboard inside the walls! Not solid particle board.. Bookshelf is fine until the day you want to move it. Ours got weaker and started to wobble, so I wanted to lay it down on its face to add metal braces to the back corners, and the thing just ripped apart under its own weight. I am glad it did because I can see now that the outer edge pieces are thin strips of MDF with cardboard filler! I can't believe they can sell this as a safe product."
70301537,Misaligned. Edge dowels won't go in all the way so the whole alignment is nearly a half inch off. If I hammer them in any harder the wood will bust.
70301542,"Dowels do not fit into shelves. I've put together several of the smaller Kallax shelves over the year with no problem. Unfortunately, with this unit the dowels are too large and do not fit in the shelves. I called to complain after ruining a couple of the shelves and dowels, was sent a new one and had the same problem. I had to redrill all the holes so the dowels would fit - very time consuming for what should be an easy assembly. Noticed this complaint in other reviews and should have paid attention."
10487816,"Nice product!. My daughter’s preferred clothing organization method is “put everything in laundry baskets.“ She needed a unit to stack her laundry baskets, this works perfectly for that!"
10487816,"The quality of wood is horrible.. The price wasn't worth it. The wood quality was not good. I had to sand and varnish because the surface of the wood was too sharp and had a lot of splinters. After assembly, the balance was not right."
10487816,Solved storage problem in the. Solved storage problem in the kitchen.
50339292,"Defective batch. After finishing the assembly, the doors were not aligned at the same level. I returned the product and ordered a replacement, but unfortunately, encountered the same issue once again"
70388639,"Good, but ... Solid sturdy shelf, but why not include some hardware covers like most other brands?  It decreases the quality appearance to have silver hardware showing. Not that hard to assemble but it would go much faster if Ikea used a little extra ink on the instructions to mark the boards. "
89442641,Great storage unit. Love this storage unit and the base with adjustable base is a must! For the price this is unbeatable!
20423720,Just what I wanted. I love everything Kalyan. IKEA never disappoints!
89442617,"Just what I was looking for. The Kallax was easy to put together, everything seem to line up no problem.  It worked in the space that I had, I would recommend this product."
10305741,Great. I love these shelves. They are easy to assemble and they are strong. I bought two of these and one is going to be my TV stand. NICE!!!
49442676,"Looks really nice.. This shelf compliments my other office furniture and is very versatile. I decided to add inserts for more functionality, but could have easily used without them. Not too hard to put together."
69442680,Built an entire wall of shelving!. We used 6 units and three bases and constructed an entire wall of shelving. We used heavy duty threaded c-clamps to securely connect each pair of units together and to connect the resulting “stacks” together.   To save assembly time we used TaskRabbit to do the assembly. Well worth the $188 dollars. The Tasker did in two hours what would have taken us 6 hours.
40311873,Looks good. Looks good
40409935,"Not worth it. I have been buying Kallax shelf since they first opened their store’s in Germany. So, many years. I used them in the garage, kids room and living room. The little cubbies are very useful and versatile. Over the years I noticed the shelf getting smaller and smaller. But now it’s enough. I will not buy them again. I will return these after coming back from my vacation. They are so not worth the money. Instructions are easy to follow and Putting them together was easy except that some of the dowels would just break off so easily, they feel like big toothpicks. I was not able to pull the broken ones out. They would just crumple as soon as my pliers touched them.  The entire shelf is so very light, it feels like I am using thick cardboard to assemble it. If you have children or pets you will definitely have to mount it to the wall.  As a consumer, at some point I have to say this is just cheap s… once put together forget about taking it apart…."
70301537,Impossible to assemble. I’ve assembled many IKEA pieces of furniture in my life and this is by far the worst. The holes drilled were not deep enough for parts to fit together and we literally had to deepen them with a drill in order to assemble the bookcase. Usually a little banging with a hammer here and there solves the issue but the holes on the sides were about 3/8” short so no amount of hammering helped (and trust me we were so pissed we used quite a bit of force). I would have returned if it wasn’t such a hassle to bring everything back when I had to borrow a car from a friend and drive 30 miles to get this in the first place.
50339292,"Perfect!. My boyfriend and I love this piece!   This universal shelving/cabinet unit can be used almost room. Sturdy, and easy to move. It’s look can be simple and used as office storage, or dressed up with a plant or storage cloth/wicker bins. Money well spent for sure!"
50339292,"Quality & Aesthetic, Tricky Assembly. The unit itself now that it’s built is great, but there are so many components that look identical yet are actually every so slightly different that are easily mistaken for the correct piece, which leads to a lot of building, disassembling, and rebuilding"
10305741,"Very modern . This is such a clean and efficient storage module.  I only wish the cardboard boxes they make fit the cubes better.  (I also liked the metal trim and lable holders on the old cardboard boxes.  Fabric is good, but the sleek coated cardboard in various colors was nice as well.  Not find if the matt paper ones) Still, this is a great piece for so many things. I seem to remember it wasn’t as heavy many years ago.  The heaviness of the furniture isn’t good. "
50339292,"Cute unit. I purchased to set up as a coffee area station in my pantry to save working counter space. Works well. Typical Ikea set up but once we figured out the layout, switching the middle vertical post to the correct side, it was fine. Level was good. Just missing the magnet to hold a door shut and they are out of stock on the missing parts page of true website, so not sure how I will fix that."
50339292,"Great Piece!. This works so well in my space. I bought with the intention of using it in my office, but it is versatile so might move it around to change things up in other rooms. Great quality for the price. It was easy for me to watch my husband put it together. LOL"
50339292,Convenient and stylish storage. Very happy with this purchase. I did set up 2. It is quite easy to put together and are great pieces of storage.
99017445,Craft space. Excellent storage and work area for crafting. Looks very nice assembled. 
50334591,"Excellent storage option!. Functional, attractive, organizational tool. I love the EKET series!"
20213312,Classy. Love the shelving unit. Looks high-end but so inexpensive. Easy to put together. It definitely should be attached to wall since it is not heavy and could tip over.
50334591,Awesome Organizational Tool. I purchased three of these to give me added space in my dresser for sweatshirts. They work wonderfully in both functionality and appearance.
99306860,Awesome Organizational Tool. I purchased this piece to put sweatshirts in to keep them better organized and neater. It works great and exceeds my expectations in both functionality and appearance.
30275861,Storage. Handy
00501889,"Looks great but starting to sag . I love how this base elevates the Kallax, but unfortunately, after about a year I can see the top shelf is starting to detach caused by sagging in the middle. I thought this would be strong given it’s constructed of metal. It really needs a center leg to properly distribute the weight.  "
10487816,The price is low and the performance is good.. The price is low and the performance is good.
10345073,"Love it. This gold shelf-within-a-shelf is perfect for board books to fit more on the shelf, or anything else that isn’t tall enough to use the whole cubby, but you want to use some of that open space above. Super cute design, easy to put on, securely attached even full of heavy books."
79442627,Sturdy budget-friendly shelving. This now commands my laundry room. Put it together in about 15 minutes. Looks great and seems like it'll last for years.
90301555,Perfect bedside table. I used the unit as a bedside table. Fits the decor perfectly.
29278262,"organization and good looking. My sewing and knitting supplies have a home. The construction was relatively easy. The space behind the doors does not allow full use of the cube, so is somewhat limited. The drawers work well, and it has been cat tested and approved."
89442679,Love it!. There's too many black shelving units in my place so I thought I'd go for a brighter unit. So glad I did! I love this for my media/turntable/vinyl/cds/art books collection. I hope thet make a dvd shelf unit.  Also easy to put together.
90324509,Love it. Perfect use 
70342199,sturdy shelf . Came together nicely. Screws were too soft. The position of the screws can be hard to reach in places. My screwdriver slipped in the slot and made the screw a bit rounded. 
20278167,Good quality and versatile.. Good quality and versatile.
20275885,"Kallax Storage unit. Speedy delivery, easy assembly, sturdy and great color, only suggestion to Ikea; provide an optional backing for this unit. Thanks, Ikea."
90286649,"So usefull. Love how it makes the Kallax look like a ""piece of intended furniture."""
70332124,Great Budget Shelving. Just the right size. Easy to assemble. Looks good on the wall. Thinking about buying more for my kids.
29294554,Love it. Just what we wanted 
59442685,"Book shelf in family room. We are very pleased with this book shelf and black base stand. At first it seemed like it was too light weight to hold all our books, but it is loaded and we are very pleased with the outcome."
40314640,Nope!. I am not going to drill holes into the cubby to insert a liner and MAYBE be accurate. Nope. Returning these and buying simple inserts.
90324509,It fits in my space!. It fits in my space! It is wonderful storage for my scrapbook albums and supplies.
10275862,"worse quality. I had pruchased this item a couple years ago and I was very happy wth them, and now I wanted to complete the design of my office with the same product, but after building it i realized that not only they are not longer the same size as before, but also they have change the quality of the product for worse! completely disappointed of IKEA's new products"
10391041,Great bookshelves. We bought 4 of these and made a library wall with them. Looks great and holds lots of books.
79278293,"Looks great under my family room windows. I put two of these, laying down like in pictue, under the windows of my family room and added a cushion on top of each. They look great and everyone enjoys sitting there and looking out the window. I am putting baskets of toys underneath for my granddaughter."
20275814,Just what I needed!. Needed a stand for my 55”TV but didn’t want to spend a lot of money.
20275814,storage. Needed something for my grandkids toys and these are the best. I 've had a Kallax unit with 12 cubbies for over 10 years. It's stood the test of time and wear. Still looks great! Love IKEA.
40324516,Used this as a horizontal book shelf.. Bought a stand for this to be mounted on and it turned out perfect.
20305745,love. LOVE these units for storage in my basement...now waiting the LEKMAN boxes to come in!!!!
40346924,Great Product. Easy to build. Quality product.
80275887,"the parts are different. I have 4 Kallax of various sizes in my house. I've never had a hard time building one before. I'm not sure what is different, maybe the wooden dowels are longer than they used to be or the holes are not as well made. This was the smallest one I've put together and it was such a pain. The dowels simply wouldn't go into the holes smoothly, even with all my weight (not inconsiderable) pushing in. I ended up using a rubber mallet that almost worked but dented the sides. I'm very disappointed."
20454504,"Super handy!. We keep this under the table as a place to organize notebooks, laptops, and cables that have shown up now that we work from home. The casters are not very effective at keeping it in place."
70388639,The wood is soft so. The wood is soft so it does dent really easily. There are no caps to cover the screws so it’s a bit of an eyesore. Very sturdy.
89294532,Perfect display shelving. I bought this to display my LEGO CONSTRACTION Star Wars figures. I needed something that was the right spacing and would also allow light to get through. My figures are seen easily in daytime and at night I have the IKEA led light strip DIODER on The underneath of the solid top shelf aimed down and its enough light for nighttime enjoyment of my figures. Construction of the shelves was easy. The hardest part was fitting the boxes in the car.
60275812,"Versatile Piece. Was looking for a printer stand for our office makeover. The Kallax is very sturdy, without loading bins in the openings. Works well adjacent to my desk area. Plenty of storage options underneath."
20415193,So very nice. I wanted bookcase that were a bit more “upscale” than the very affordable Billy bookcases. I was so happy with the Havasta! Very sturdy- high quality. I used it without the base due to height restrictions in the desired space. It works perfectly fine that way. I really like this product.
10487816,Sturdy. I like that the shelves are metal. I plan on painting the wood legs black. 
59425916,Sturdy. Love these cubes. They are sturdier and better quality than the one I bought from Target.
10305741,"Quality control issues. I purchased three of these. Two assembled as expected, the other had a piece that someone forgot to drill holes in. Now I have to pack it up and drive an hour round trip to hopefully get a correctly manufactured one."
00275848,Great. Great
90305803,"Good Looks, BUT Tough Assembly. I have now assembled 8 shelf units and have found that in every unit there are at least 3 mis-alligned screw holes. This makes it frustratingly VERY HARD TO SCREW together and ends up taking extra time and effort. Once together, they look great."
20213312,"Nice. It's really clean looking and smooth. Only thing, I would not say it's toddler friendly. But otherwise it's a great item"
20213312,"Got so many compliments! But this shelf wobbles!. I loved this so much I went back for another one! Great price and size. 50 mins to assemble for me. THIS DOESNT DESERVE FIVE STARS because the parts didn't fit together when I assembled it, even though in great at building. They weren't manufactured right. Also it wobbles left to right with if pulled or pushed lightly!!!!!!!!"
40303439,"Great shelves. Really love this shelving unit. I have several large lego sets and this is perfect for displaying them, most other bookshelves or shelving units are too small. Glass is easy to clean as well. "
70339291,Great item. Sturdy and well built! 
89278301,Beautiful and functional. Beautiful. Functional. Practical. Quality.
90301555,Versatile Kallax shelving. So easy to put together and can be used vertically or horizontally. Looks so clean. Exactly what I needed in my kitchen for extra shelving.
10409932,Looks better than i nexpected.. Looks better than i nexpected. Very pleased
29278304,Nice . Nice choice from us in getting this of our home 
00314642,"Good quality products. Great quality. Well made , by me, but solid furniture. Mostly easy to follow instructions. I like the challenge."
59552914,New entryway look. Added to our entryway to replace an old sofa table with zero storage. Baskets hold shoes and doors/drawers hide stuff.
00415599,Kallax Shelf Unit. This shelf unit is sturdy and able to hold lots of books without the worry of the shelves bowing. It has clean lines and fits in with my white sewing furniture. Went together very quickly. Very pleased with my purchase.
40314640,like the drawers better. Aligning and securing the Kallax door was little hard . You have to make a new hole on the shelf and then screw the door unit on.
00275848,"Brackets not spaced for wall studs. I think this shelf is perfect. I only wish the brackets were spaced for wall studs. They the way they are, only one mounting screw hits a stud. The other side must rely on a dry wall anchor."
90428842,"Very happy! . Priced right. Looks good! Works great. Added wood glue for insurance, but could be fine without "
20278167,NOT HAPPY - NEED TO RUIN BOOKCASE TO USE. I am not happy with these as you need to screw them into your bookshelf which will put holes into your unit. Returning as I had not open these yet but opened the drawer ones which is the same. I think IKEA should put this in the description. Will never understand why they changed them.
80275887,Super easy to build. I am a 13 year old and this was very simple to build! I only needed my dad’s help twice!! The end result is super nice it is great! im on my dads account btw
50324511,Drawers. Good
00501889,"Not for Older Models. I bought my Kallax 2010and just brought this base, but found that the screw hole does not align. I compared it to the newer Kallax model and found the older model has thicker sideboards. I wish Ikea had a sign that says ""for models from 20xx-20××""."
10391041,Simple and sturdy. Purchased as a storage shelf. It's solid and the lip on the back of the shelves help keep items secured
20213312,"damaged parts. I did a click and collect on this item. After driving 5 hours round trip, I got home to put it together and one of the sides was really damaged. I ended up putting it together but needed zip ties and had to hammer out the flat pieces."
90286649,Perfect addition to my Kallax shelves. I have several Kallax shelves holding vinyl LP albums. I just added another to my media room for board games. I am glad they make a consistent product from year to year. Even the color matches. The drawers are great accessories. I'm using them for decks and games pieces. Perfect.
80487813,they fit perfectly in the space needed. They are light and bright and sturdy
80487813,"Easy to assemble, looks great. Purchased this to hold plants in front of a long window. Very easy to assemble, looks neat and clean while letting the plants shine. Able to store plant food, watering can, etc on lower shelf. Very convenient."
20275814,Great for closet. It fits in my closet. Waiting for the taller 4 unit on stock. It really helps organize your closet. Waiting for the inserts to place my shoes next.
20213312,"Who owns a glass punch?. The instructions were… fine, but it did not come with a glass punch (?) that you’re supposed to use on step 18 to screw into the glass. I have thousands of dollars of tools and no glass punch. Also, the end product is wobbly."
40415601,Great product. Easy to assemble
40423719,Perfect for desk top …. Perfect for desk top … with a couple modifications
20278167,Great storage for crafting supplies . My wife used this for all of her craft and sewing projects 
10221685,"Exceeded my expectation. I hesitated buying it because of the price and there was no sample on the floor. I took a chance and came back because the shelving unit looks bland. I was surprise how well the construction, sleekness and it has a soft close mechanism. A definite add-on and the pricing in my opinion makes sense."
10305802,Cute and functional. Terrible to put together.. Holes for screws do not line up MOST of the time. Very difficult to put together involving much swearing and a need for power tools.
70388639,Love. We added them to the cabinets that they originally go to and it makes our living room look amazing.
20275814,Classic and easy. I love this series and find it both stylish and convenient for storage and display. I bought the 2x2 to stack on top of a Kallax unit I already had.
70286645,Easy to install and assemble. Easy to install and assemble
40346924,it's fine... but definitely a re-engineered version of previous purchase. I have purchased 8 cube storage shelving several times in the past and have always enjoyed the option of adding casters to the bottom to make them easily moveable. I didnt realize this was no longer an option. I was disappointed to find the boards are now hollow and in order to attach casters I was forced to improvise.
20278167,"Hmmmm, on the fence here.. I have the old expedit shelving that wasn’t put together exactly like they were supposed to. Close enough to work as shelving but not great for thr insets. I also bought the drawers for them although they’re not ‘fixed’ and I can take them out as needed. I have to say I was expecting a better quality door insert. This looks and feels more like cardboard! The drawer inserts are much more substantial and I had expected that for the doors! Lets mot EVEN talk about the directions and of how little help they are! Did’t realize the door assembly would be so difficult! Ah well, I’ll put them together another day!"
19552949,"Ordered twice. After moving we ordered this item as a night table It’s perfect! Also added 2doors, all essentials can be stored."
20275814,Fantastic! . I put wheels on 2 Kallax & Table Top
30275861,Getting Organized. Sick of the clutter and these shelves are just what I need!  With the accessory shelves and bins it is just perfect.
19189030,EKET Perfect for my Sewing Room Decor. We bought the shelves for sewing room decor. It was perfect. I wish I could post a picture for you all to see. Thank You IKEA
29278304,Sturdy storage unit. This is a very sturdy unit. It was very easy to assemble. We bought two doors and two drawer units. It made it very useful for us.
80428852,Nice. Nice
70286645,Perfect!. Easy to assemble and they work great!
40275846,"The Standard for Storing Records. The Kallax is the standard for record storage. This product is built sturdily, and it is attractive. It's a great addition to any music room."
80303437,"VITTSJO Review. Great piece, including quality, value and price!"
79521356,"Eket Cube. These cubes are pretty easy to put together and to hang.  They look great as well.  Great purchase, recommend!"
80487813,Ample shelf space. Great value for your money.. I was looking for another item i saw online but decided on purchasing this one instead when I saw it in person at the showroom. I liked that the shelves are thin metal yet very strong. The 5 shelves worked perfectly for my walk in closet space.
20275885,"I Love It!!. These are so easy to put together, lightweight to move around and look great in my living room. Perfect for holding puzzles and other goodies and not too deep to make the room feel small."
20301554,"Our favorite furnishing. Kallex cubes are all over our house. We love them that much. Most recent purchase included two double cube and a single cube we are using as sturdy plant stands to keep away from new rescue pug that wants to eat everything. Only negative is that I think single cube is overpriced compared to others (which are a great value for the money). Versatility with drawers, doors, bottle inserts and bins is a a big plus. (I wish there were glass doors, though.)"
70339291,"Great addition to the living room. This is a great shelf, very sturdy and creates a nice divide between the living room and our dinner table. I can confidently place my small speakers and plants without worrying if I bump into it."
90305803,"Utilitarian with simple style. I got this in the As Is section of the store (my favorite!)  I didn't realize it was meant to be a TV stand until I looked it up later. I'm using it as an end piece for my IKEA Vallentuna sleeper sofa because it fits perfectly, and the glass middle shelf lets light get to the bottom shelf, where I have some ceramic decorations.  The only thing is that because it was As Is, there's permanent marker on it with some identification info, which I wish the employee hadn't done because it won't come off, though that's not an issue with this product specifically."
60275812,"Organize stuff to look neat in LR. Papers, files, books, maps, cables and more piling up in a corner? Look terrible? Quickly assemble these units to hold organized, attractive storage boxes.. Even look good in the Living Room."
50339292,"Storage . I'm using as a record player stand and record storage. It also has the additional storage at the bottom for whatever needs""hiding"". Did in perfectly with the current decor..."
70388639,Havsta Shelf. The shelf is fine but assembly is impossible. The parts are not clearly labeled and the instructions are bad. The only help comes from customer videos and there were none for this shelf.
20305745,"Perfect shelf. Used this to put wigs, purses & hats on really looks cool with the gloss white"
50305739,"Kallax Review. The kallax was easy to assemble, love the shiny finish, and quality is as expected."
50305739,Sturdy Shelving. I bought this for my son and his new wife. This is exactly what they were asking for. I was surprised at how heavy and sturdy the unit was. They are very pleased with their gift!
10275862,"Excellent Product!. For such a big shelf, it was very easy to assemble, if a little time consuming. Next to no tools needed, and once finished, is very sturdy. Would definitely recommend "
00334536,Great efficient beautiful product. Great efficient beautiful product
80401292,"Kallax shelves and divider. I used the Kallax shelves and divider in my closet. I have placed 9 pairs of sandals into the divider, it’s a great use of space."
10305741,"Surprisingly Poor Construction. This is the first IKEA product series I have been sorely disappointed with. We have bought quite a few products from IKEA: desks, outdoor furniture, a bed, chairs, a dining room table, and quite a few others.  In most cases, the tolerances are quite good, and things fit tightly, so long as you follow the directions.   For both KALLAX shelves I bought, the problem is the dowels: following the directions, using a hammer, I inexplicably damaged both shelves because the dowels didn’t quite fit.  I do not recommend this at all. I am not returning it, due to the distance to the store. If it wasn’t so far, both would be going back."
60333954,"Excellent quality. The item is excellent quality, sturdy and easy to assemble."
49306872,Good product. Good product
60275812,Kallax 4 cubby. I prefer to get the smaller 2-4 cube shelf units a they’re much easier to move around or if you’re having a manic moment in the middle of the night and want to rearrange the entire room. It’s far better to move smaller shelves than the larger 8+ units. … was it worth the price? Mmm I’m pretty sure these used to be around 30ish bucks but now they’re back up to 40 to 60 rounded up. I’d appreciate if they were 34 dollars  and wouldn’t spike up in cost more than 5 bucks. Idk that’s just me 
60324520,"Great for LP storage. I bought a few of these in the 8-cube configuration a long time ago to store vinyl records and loved them. I heard that IKEA discontinued them years ago and recently found out that they started making them again. The new edition is not quite as sturdy as the originals but are still very good. The outside frame is a little more narrow and the whole unit is slightly lighter, but the old ones were probably heavier than they needed to be so this shouldn't be a big deal. Happy with both the quality and the value. "
70301537,Perfect shelving!. I have a large craft room that was now easily organized by the space made by this 5x5 unit. 
29278262,Not worth the price.  Poor construction. Beware the door assemble and construction is junk.  I have had this for less than 6 months and the side ripped away from the side walls and I have tried to fix it and it keeps falling apart.  It is really terrible cheap construction.  The pull out drawer part is fine but the doors that close are garbage.  Don't buy this if you need closing doors.
60275812,"Very nice. We’ve had the tall 4 shelf for over 20 years and it’s still in perfect shape. Ordered this square unit to accompany and it doesn’t disappoint. It matches perfectly. Sturdy, easy to assemble and looks amazing."
80334603,great for scrapbook paper storage.  Not easy to put together.. Great for scrapbook paper storage.
49442676,"Perfect for board games. Very easy to assemble, sturdy storage for our collection of games."
80487813,EKENABBEN Shelving was perfect. Purchased two and being used in the garage to organize boxed items to pull when needed. Sturdy shelving with enough spacing to keep boxes off the ground. Great price for our needs.
59552914,Kallax Bookcase. The book cases works. It's an inexpensive option for the time being
80275887,Wrong color in box!. I purchased a second Kallax unit in the black color to match the one I already own. The sticker on the box indicated that the color was black. The pieces inside were white. I live 5 hours away and can’t justify driving back to return it. Highly recommend you pop the box open before you leave the store to double check the color!
80487813,"Beautiful shelf!. I am pleased with this shelf! It is a great price, easy to assemble, and has a lot of space. It also looks great!"
60278170,"First purchase. Nice unit, easy to assemble. I did forget about securing the Kallax to the wall before installing the insert. "
39442672,Books. Holds all of my cookbooks
20275814,"Craft Room Complete. Several years ago I bought a series of Kallax cubes for my craft room. They worked out so well, I decided to line the opposite walls with more cubes. These are well built and can be adapted to every type of storage need."
20423720,Kallax shelf. I love my Kallax units and this shelf helps to organize my crafts by using up extra space.
80487813,EKENABBEN PRODUCT .  This Ekenabben Open Shelf Unit is an outstanding product that can be used for many different options.
10305741,"Glossy finish off-putting. I love the shape, design. But the mounting is not functional. The security brackets are not spaced for both to hit studs, so the expectation is that one would be in a stud and one in an anchor. I decided to wall-mount mine, so I placed brackets on the bottom. It looks great on the wall. And finally, the finish is glossy, almost glassy, which clashes a little with my eggshell walls. Not a deal-breaker, but not what I was hoping for."
80487813,So cute . These shelves made my kitchen cute
10305741,"High gloss white is not white it’s UGLY yellow white. The high gloss white is yellowish not a true white and it looks disgusting with the blue pansartax boxes, not to mention it was originally delivered without the base, I ended up having to order another base and pay delivery twice because customer service would have had me wait a week, one of the boards arrived damaged to top it all off but the worst part is honestly the color and the fact that it’s so complicated to construct that you can’t return"
40346924,Shelving. Awesome product to put in my craft room for storage. Easy to put together and position in the room
70339291,"Perfect fit!. I was looking for something that would hold our receiver and turntable, while looking good with another piece of furniture. This was it, and it looks great."
20275814,Kallax. I have 2 of these now. They make for easy quick bookshelves and storage
60221683,"Excellent product . Slim design, nice width and height, number of shelves, strength and quality are A+! Excellent design made it very easy to put together also. Love it, went back and bought a second one!"
10391041,Good for the space it. Good for the space it was intended for
50483289,"Great storage addition to my sewing room!. I bought this little shelf for my sewing room to provide more storage as well as provide an ironing surface. With this shelf being at counter height, I can easily add a do-it-yourself ironing board to the top! (plywood+batting+pretty fabric) This will make this piece even more versatile, which is great! My husband put it together for me and was surprised it just snapped together. He did come across one broken piece that he had to go exchange at our local IKEA, but out of all the items we have purchased, this has been the only instance of that happening. I actually do not have this one attached to the wall at the moment, but it seems sturdy and holds a lot. I am very happy with this purchase!"
60278170,"Stylish. Fits IKEA cabinets like they’re supposed to and look stylish, gives the cabinet a more upgraded look"
20278167,Great. This door adds beauty and function to my Kallax unit.
29481678,Looks good and a good. Looks good and a good value. A little awkward to assemble but well designed and sturdy. Read and understand all instructions thoroughly before starting.
60324520,"Sturdy and worth it!. I own the 2x2, the 2x4, and the 4x4 Kallax products. They are so sturdy and work great with it without the bins. I highly recommend them as a solid piece of furniture in any room."
20409936,More storage. The only issue I have it needs to be reinforce some how the inner sides come loose and pull apart .
20278167,Great addition!. Love the versatility the Kallax cubes offer. These door fronts were easy to install and fit great.
70388639,"Love this set up. I purchased three base units with doors, two of the upper shelves and one upper shelf with glass doors. It looks fantastic!"
29481659,"So much quality. I made a whole wall of the cubbies.  They are versatile,  sturdy and beautiful.   I have the desk attached it is wonderful.   I have used a sewing machine and the ceramic items and statues didn't even jiggle.   Recommend for everyone. "
40501892,"NOT fit old Kallax shelf unit!!. I have two Kallax shelf units of the same size, measuring 30 3/8 by 57 7/8 inches, which I bought at different times. One is high gloss white, and the other one is regular white. The base legs can only be installed with the white unit, which I purchased about two years after the gloss white one. The part number 10081882/10081773, which is designed to connect the Kallax unit to the legs, is shorter and cannot reach the holes on the old high gloss Kallax unit. but the product detail information here mentioned it fit all KALLAX unit. which is not true!"
80275887,Great Office Addition. I use Kallax on its side to create an L-shaped desk in my new office. It has worked great. Was very easy and quick to assemble.
30495599,"Perfect for NEWER Kallax Shelving. I love the way this elevates the look of these shelves (and literally lifts them off the floor, so they’re less dusty).   Be careful! If you have Kallax shelves that were purchased several years back. IKEA changed the design several years ago, and the outer dimensions are about an inch off. Mine are slightly bigger than the current Kallax shelves, so these legs don’t actually mount properly. I was able to screw them into my slightly larger version and use them."
20409936,Kallax. Very sturdy using it as a dresser in a small room 
20278167,Doors. Great quality. Good looks. Easy to assemble.
59294557,"Very nice wall unit at a great price. Easy to assemble, thoughtful design, sturdy and attractive"
20213312,"A little wobbly. This is the second vittsjo I’ve purchased in the last few years and this one seems to wobble and sway a bit. I recommend anchoring to the wall. I’ve assembled a lot of ikea furniture and the like over the years, so pretty confident I assembled this correctly."
20278167,Perfect Fit. Easy to put together. Fits my needs exactly. Simple and clean.
20278167,Old style was better. While the doors are functional and look good I gave 2 stars because the quality has certainly declined. Walls are now made of cardboard rather than the sturdy construction of previous models. Difficult to install due to screws tearing cardboard walls before ever making it flush onto the kallax cube wall.
40303439,Was not what I thought it would be. Once assembled it get rather flimsy for books. Better off getting a billy bookcase or similar for heavy objects. It would be great for decor and Knick knacks.
20275885,Nice for the price. I decided to organize and create a smaller footprint for the toys the grandkids play with when they come over. This works great. The 13 by 13 cubes are very spacious. I do recommend fastening it to the wall if in the upright position because the little ones definitely try to climb it.
20423720,Wish this was available in all colors!. This would be a perfect option for my use but it doesn’t come in the black brown color so I’ll be looking for other options outside of IKEA
90495596,Fabulous. I made a wall to wall bookcase in my old home. Then there was no  extra  frame with legs. This is a relief since it makes it easy to clean below the bookcase.  Love it!
10487816,Great shelf for smaller spaces. This shelf had the exact dimensions I needed to fit a small space. It was perfect to keep all my flour bins in the kitchen. Keep in mind that the metal shelves are extremely thin and can dent easily. So take care when assembling the unit!!
40415601,"Kallax Shelf Unit. I already purchased one of these for another room; so, I knew what I was getting. Really STURDY and very handsome. I didn't have any problems putting this piece together. I have all my sewing books in there."
40311873,"Excellent value for this product family!. I like this size for kids toys and end tables.  I can put one of these together in about 20 minutes taking my time.  I am a Kallax fan.  We have purchased many sizes with various inserts over the years, and we have never been disappointed.  I think my favorite is the black brown with doors and drawers.  My kids prefer the lighter color units with colored inserts (especially the green metal doors offered several years ago.)  The lighter colors don't require as many touchups over the years, but touching up scratches isn't difficult if you're crafty. We have used permanent marker and paint to good effect.  If your product is damaged or missing parts when you get home, IKEA will make it right.  They have even mailed parts to my house.  Reach out to customer service and see what your options are."
20275814,Kallax cube storage. These are the best! I wish I had more of them.
50339292,"Great look, great security.. I love this line for the industrial natural look. This particular unit has the front doors with perfect handles to thread a baby lock through! "
19552949,Good for small space . I like it
10391041,"Havsta open shelves. Beautiful, open shelves for displaying framed photos and books. Shelves are very thick and sturdy. I love this piece of furniture. I plan on adding 1 more piece of Havsta furniture to the living area for closed storage to have a beautiful, coordinated look."
90305803,Really Tough to Assemble . Shelf looks great and functions well after it's put together but it was really difficult to assemble by myself. The wood shelf's are not predrilled so you have to apply a ton of pressure to get the screws in. I ended up using Bungie cords to hold the shelf in place while I added the screws. This would've been easier if I had clamps or a second person applying pressure.
00275848,Perfect fit. I needed something for storage that would fit under my large window. I was rearranging my craft room and didn't have enough storage. Kallax + bins and done! I'll put a cushion on top and the cat will be able to look out at squirrels all day!
20423720,Love this shelf. This pice creates a functional shelf and adds to the look and storage of the Kallie cube unit. Awesome price and unbelievably easy to put together. 
50454507,"Perfect find. I was looking for a shelf of some sort for my printer/extra office supplies. The Billy bookcases were much too narrow and the Kallax were too chunky for the space I needed it in. This cart is the perfect compromise! The Pudda baskets fit perfectly in the square compartments, and I’ve got spare paper, notebooks, etc on the shelves. The quality was also surprising; I’m used to most Ikea furniture coming with a super thin board you nail in to the back, but the back of this is sturdy and could certainly be exposed in the room. Thanks for this piece, Ikea! Hopefully there will be a broader color range in the future."
70301537,Perfect fit. We love the quality. I used it as a room seperator. 
29481701,Office Space (sans Bill Lumbergh). Versatile. Functional. 8 years and counting. KALLAX is a killer line.
70538846,"Also good as a TV Stand if you don't want to put your TV at a too low position. I bought this as my TV Stand, because I don't want to put the TV at a too low position. It works well. The depth of the frame can hold a 55 inch Samsung S95B and a Bose S700 soundbar (it is not too slim to place a big TV with wide/deep stand). The heights between the 3 boards are good enough to put Playstation 5 / Xbox game consoles vertically as well. It is easy for us to have wires through (of course, not so good to hide those wires because there is no such a whole board at the back). The structure is solid enough.  Assembling is OK. Although the structure is simple and clear, there are too many screws to put in. I finally forfeit one of them since I am sure it doesn't hurt at all without that screw. Designers should simplify that more if possible. On Pricing perspective, a little expensive for $179."
20275885,"Perfect organizer. So, my daughter and two grands are visiting and need somewhere to place personals and clothing items. This unit works perfect and adds to the decor of the room. We currently have a wicker day bed and TV with a few accent items. The organizer is the right fit."
70286645,Love these drawers. I originally bought these drawers when I bought Kallax cube unit. Installing the drawers and building the 8 cube unit was easy. I loved the drawers so much I actually ordered another set. They give the unit a different look and are functional as additional storage! 
80275887,KALLAX is one of the. KALLAX is one of the best storage systems on the market.
10487816,"Love! Perfect shelf for my little plant collection. . It’s exactly what I was looking for. It’s aesthetically pleasing and I love the natural look with the white. It has a good weight to it and I feel it will hold up well, as long as I don’t put too much stuff on it. The metal shelving is extremely convenient since plants tend to be messy and drop water all of the time, making for easy cleaning. I also love the spacing between the shelves because they’re the perfect width apart where I can add smaller plants on the lower levels. Absolutely in love. It was also extremely easy to install; I used a drill to ensure it was sturdy. "
40510863,"Beautiful color. Easy to assemble, stacks nicely, perfect"
20275814,"Always a Versatile Favorite. We wanted two eight cube units and the store was sold out so we bought four of the four cube units and what was a disappointment at first worked out to be a plus. We place two together but now have the ability to split them up in different places in the room, move one to another room, etc. They are solid and not difficult to assemble."
60275812,Got another one.. Great little shelf - I already had one and got another for the upstairs hallway. 
00334536,"Love love love eket!. When we redid our daughters’ room we needed to replace their Kallax bookshelf with something only slightly narrower. I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the eket is smaller, it holds way more books! This would be because the inner and outer walls are thinner. The eket takes some more muscle to put together than kallax but you can get more functionality from the eket. Plus we liked that they have backs so our kids don’t lose things in the abyss behind the unit. Also included are the stand-off posts so it can be flush against your floor trim and the wall! My new favorite go-to piece!"
10487816,Handy little shelf. One nice extra touch that you might not notice on the picture is that it has leveling feet.  I’m using mine as a plant shelf - the metal shelves are nice because they do get a little wet when I mist my plants.
90495695,Wine storage. Excellent fit. Wish there were other colors but worked perfect.
10391041,Solid pine construction. Expected another particle board furniture. This is solid pine. The stain and finish are amazing. The furniture is very strong (why the box is so heavy).
10305741,"Kallax white gloss bookcases . I love these to store all my books. They are very sturdy once attached to the wall. I must say that they are not as nice as the Expedit units they replaced. They’re a bit thinner overall but still have the same interior dimensions to fit larger books. Easy to assemble except the sticky plastic  protective strips were an absolute pain to peel off. It took longer to peel all that off than to actually put the units together. Very annoying! Other than that, I would definitely recommend them. I have hundreds of books and I love how organized and beautiful everything looks. I will be trimming them out with base, trim and crown molding for a built in look."
49481658,"Perfect sewing table!. I am using it as a sewing table. Instead of having the shelf upright, I laid it on its side and I have an L-shaped sewing table. The table is study enough for sewing and I have canvas storage bins underneath to hide materials."
00324518,"Just what we needed!!. We needed a large bookcase to fit under our windows. when turned on the side, it fit perfectly. And because the cubbies are square, it did not affect the space. If you follow the directions, the bookcase will go together easily. It is quite sturdy. Perfect!!"
09189200,"Misleading and disappointing.. I didn't realize this piece was just three different pieces put together, and that's on me, but that being said, I had issues with every piece. All the pieces are made to go together without tools, and that relies on the pieces fitting just right, and they do not. Even when I got them to slide into place they weren't flush at the corners. The instructions were beyond confusing because Ikea now refuses to put any words in their instructions and only one piece in every box was labeled at all. On the other hand, the feet required a power drill to install, and I can't see that reflected anywhere in the description. I decided not to use them, which would have been fine except I paid like $15 more for them to be included in the bundle. There was also no way that I could see to pysically attach the cubes to each other. This is my third failed Ikea build-turned-return in a row, and I'm confident in my assembly abilities. I've loved ikea for years, but they have lost my business."
00314642,great little drawers. just enough space to function
40311873,Great product we got the. Great product we got the drawers to go inside. All easy to build
20423720,Chips easily. This is interesting to put together where it doesn’t hold by itself and kind of have to shimmy in the unit. In putting it together it chipped and I was being careful and didn’t drop it. For the price I wouldn’t recommend.
50481172,"Just right. For something so light and easily assembled, and moderately priced, this shelf is really quite sturdy. I'm using it for plants, so the open design is perfect. The spacing between shelves is generous. I may buy another (but that would lead to buying more plants...)"
40275846,Nice Unit. Love the skinny design - fits in nicely next to my stack washer/dryer unit.
40311873,Great Addition. Fits right in with my old three-drawer shelf in the same line.
20275885,Great Piece . I have a couple of these - sturdy but light enough for one person to move. Looks good and highly functional.  
20275885,"Great shelf, poor delivery. The Kallax shelf is a great and versatile bookshelf. I'm using it to display heavy books and collectibles. The different configuration options allow me to customize the unit(s) to fit my exact needs. The IKEA delivery service however was not so great. IKEA used a 3rd party delivery company that left much to be desired. The delivery was rescheduled twice and communication was inconsistent and confusing. I received text messages from the company informing me that the delivery was 30 minutes away put the gps link showed the truck at least 90 minutes away. Later the delivery was cancelled and rescheduled. When the order finally did come I received another text informing me it was 30 minutes away and immediately after a text saying delivery complete."
40346924,Kallax - looks great !. easy to install recommend purchasig the stand
20454504,Great for under my desk. Thus was easy to put together. Fits perfectly under my craft desk. Holds computer router and other components.
30275861,Perfect. So easy to put together and looks so great in the intended space in our home.
20275885,"I can’t drill holes into my space. Apparently, these need to be permanently affixed via screws into plaster to be safe. NO THANKS AS THAT IS NOT A VIABLE OPTION!"
20423720,"Love it. It's perfect to make a ""garage"" for my son's trucks in our kallax shelf. I only wish it came in the other colors but it does the job even though it's mismatched."
70286645,"great upgrade. I wish the drawers were a little deeper, seems like the walls could be a few inches taller for even more capacity but they are a great upgrade to the single deep bin I had before. They were very easy to install and I want to complement the designers on how it's almost impossible to assemble them incorrectly because each hole and screw is different. Everything came together nicely. I struggled a bit with attaching the insert to the Kallax frame because I don't have strong enough hands to screw into the particle board but will borrow an electric screwdriver and I'm sure that'l take care of it. "
90495695,easy to install and functional. These inserts allowed me to sort some fabric rolls for easer access. I found the bin too deep and it quickly got so cluttered. This way my rolls are organized for easy access and less wrinkles. 
20423720,"Great addition to make Kallax even more effective. I've enjoyed the upgrade of Kallax. I added drawers, this shelf and the crisscross. My sewing supplies are not much more accessible. I found the large bins too deep and stuff just tended to gather on the bottom, things got wrinkled. Now everything has it's own place and is much more accessible. "
40346924,Best Board Game Storage Out There. We bought this for our collection of board games. It’s the perfect size and looks great. Very easy to put together. We’ll probably be getting more. 
20409936,"Best storage solution . This is simply the best storage solution for just about anything from toys, vinyl, movies, games and etc... "
10275862,Kallax 16. Works great. Easy to assemble.
59442685,"Kallax for record albums. I like the kallax, especially with the riser. Easy to out rigger, but no matter how careful I am putting together flat pack there is always a “seam” that doesn’t quite align. One side came pre-dented; I didn’t feel like spending 2 hours to return it so put the damaged side to the wall. "
10487816,Sturdy little shelf. I love this shelf! It’s very sturdy. I bought it for my mom’s kitchen because she needed more storage. She likes it.
40409935,I did it myself! XD. This is the first time I have built an IKEA furniture. Normally my son does it for me. He is a Navy sailor and has been away from home. I wanted to remodel his room and bought this shelf to display his model cars etc. I wanted the white shelf but mistakenly took the natural wood. I was going to return it but the color was a better fit for the bedroom theme. Not to mention how easy it was to put together. I'm making a list of other pieces I wanted but found intimidating. 
80334603,"Hard to assemble if you don't follow the directions.. Follow the directions! Pay attention to the ""1"" printed on one of the pieces and get a rubber mallet and these can be assembled in 2 mins.  I first tried these without reading the directions as it was only 5 pieces. It was a nightmare. You can do the first 3 sides and then slide the particle board in and then you will spend 1hr plus losing your mind, patience, temper, etc swearing the product is defective. I even broke one trying to jam it in as it just wouldn't line up... However, my wife then asked if I followed the directions and I didn't even look at them. She then took it and followed the directions and assembled multiple of them in 2 minutes :) lol you just have to pay attention to the directions and the ""1"" and they are so easy to do but use a rubber mallet with a cloth to make it easier - thanks wife.  Hope this helps."
80334603,Dimensionally Wrong Construction. This is the worst ikea product I’ve ever had so far. It doesn’t fit last part and ridiculously doesn’t make sense. Please listen to the reviews that are similar to mine.
80334603,"Almost impossible to build. The assembly process almost took me down. Down to a sad, dark, dark place. In lieu of regular screws, it is necessary to wedge into place plastic screws that required maximum force to set into place — including sitting on it, jumping on it with the full force of a grown adult, and ultimately banging it at full intensity and speed with a hammer, which admittedly provided an outlet for the pent up frustration. Do not buy this unless you are ready to face the ultimate challenge"
60530577,Frustrated!. Just bought this unit today and was excited to put it together. Talk about frustrating! Bad instructions and I couldn't get it assembled with the back panel in place. Once you align the plastic screws on 3 sides and slide in the back panel it is impossible to get the screws on the 4th side lined up AND in line with the back panel! Dinged it up a bit with my effort. Hardest piece from Ikea that I've ever tried to assemble. So disappointed!
80334603,"Difficult to assemble. I read the reviews and the difficult the cabinet is to assemble but I bought it anyway, which I don't completely regret because I live the design, but I'll definitely have to get a real rabbit person to assist. The directions for mounting the shelf are especially vague."
60510862,"If You Can Put It Together...Pieces Do Not Align Well. This piece would have been a beautiful storage option , if you can put it together that is. After trying for a few weeks, I just was not able to put these cubes together. The video provided on product's page isn't near close to reality, and customer service just recommends using Task Rabbit. There's something about these units that are not correctly lining up so that they can slide and lock into place. Ultimately, and unfortunately have to make the trek to return."
60221683,Great shelves. Perfect shelves for my craft room. Fits 12x12 paper/holders both in height and depth. Highly recommend for crafters.
90305803,Great shelf!. This is great for plants. Would also be a nice minimalist bookshelf or console/entry table 
20409936,"Kallax 12. Works great, easy to assemble."
20301554,Easy to Assemble. easy to find the item in the warehouse  easy to assemble 
20275814,"Nursery Shelves. Loved this for my baby’s nursery. At 18 weeks pregnant, I was able to put together easily with a little direction from my husband "
30275861,Kallax shelf. Great product - easy direction to put it together - great quality and looks in great price.
80401292,Low value for price. A bit upset as it’s chipped in two places while careful my putting it together. It has weight to it but it’s now ugly from the chips. It took some time to get it in the init. I also would like if it had a back without having to purchase a door. The unit being opened in the back means things can fall behind it. I purchased so I can put my kids Lego cars in it. 
79552913,kallax. love it
10487816,Great shelf. My daughter uses this for her record player and records. It was easy to put together. The size is perfect too.
30495599,Keeps it off the ground. . This is a great.   It keeps it up so a vacuum can get under.   With all my animals and hair everywhere this is a great item. 
70286645,Add drawers to cubes. Easy to assemble ( our 14 year old put it together for her room). Nice addition to the cubes
20409936,Very versatile. I had a small wall in my living room where I needed more book storage. Very happy with this unit.
59442685,"Kallax 4 x 2. Easy to assemble, sturdy construction. Wish the base stand came in matching color. "
20275814,"versatile. We bought two of these for different spaces, and it completely changed the disorder that used to be there. We especially like that it's versatile and can be used in different ways; it allows you to have different types of baskets/containers and is the ideal size for small spaces."
40501892,tv stand component. sturdy and well made
20473593,Great!. Well built and sturdy!
40275846,"So many uses!. I have many of the Kallax of different sizes in our house. It is great that with the addition of doors or drawers and new hardware you can make it fit into so many different styles and uses!! I do wish that there were more insert options in the colors other than white, or the abiltiy to have a door that will cover 2 squares at once, but other than that this is great!"
29481701,"Nice Craft Table Option. Well-built and thought out. We set ours up vertically. The hardware kit comes with two shelf braces, so the table doesn't rely too heavily on the wood shelf it's mounted on. The bookshelf also comes with wall anchors which I highly recommend if you have children using this. It was easy to install. Took a little bit of effort to level the legs. TIP: to start, lay the table face down with legs up and adjust the height of the legs to the shelf that you want to mount to. From there, when you flip it, you can adjust and level. All holes are pre-drilled for you except where the table bracket mounts to the shelf and where the braces will mount under each shelf, but the little screws are pretty well-self tapping. I piloted the first few and then found out I can just put pressure and turn them in manually. This is WAY WAY sturdier and well built than then the lame Walmart Better Homes and Garden version that I previously purchased and promptly returned."
39285808,"Versatile cubbies. We installed 3 above my daughter's desk for books and mini stereo system, and another 3 on a wall to display items. They look great! There was some difficulty putting the fourth side attached as it is very snug and needed brute force/rubber mallet."
30275861,"Perfect for My Scrapbooks and Supplies . I have been a scrapbooker for many years so I have a lot of albums, papers, and  supplies to store. The KALLAX unit is perfect! It’s sturdy and the cubicles are the perfect size. Assembly was fairly easy. I wish I had bought one years ago! "
80512959,"Bookcase. A bit of a challenge for me to assemble, yet I did it and love the bookcase. May consider purchasing a 2d. "
29442677,"Really well made! . I bought this for storage of my grandkids toys. It went together very well. Very easy to assemble, just follow the instructions. Would highly recommend!!"
10305741,Excellent item. Very nice and awesome look
80275887,Perfect for my nail room!!. Exactly what I needed and love the quality and price!!
69442642,Great for record storage. Easy to assemble and great to vinyl record storage.
89442641,A more finished style.. I love Kallax and it looks even better sitting on a base.
00415599,"Perfect. We've recently moved into an incredibly small apartment. The kitchen hardly has any cupboard space at all and we were seriously lacking space for our food. The little ""pantry"" they gave us now holds our plastics and appliances. We didn't have any counter space for our microwave, toaster, or toaster oven. Not to mention the lack of space for our dry goods. We bought this and two of the 2x6 kallax shelves to put on either side of it. Now we have all the room we need, plus the top of this for our three appliances we use often. It has plenty of space for stacking cans and keeping cereal boxes. We love our shelves."
20275885,Looks Great! Good Storage for. Looks Great! Good Storage for My Needs
80334603,Storage. Great answer for storage - whether it's books or wine - and - they're stackable!
89442617,"Great Storage. Easy to assemble, looks great. We liked it enough to buy a second one."
89307643,NICER THAN PIC. I LOVE IT. COMPACT BUT ROOMY
80275887,This is what I was. This is what I was looking for and works as expected.
80401292,Wine rack. This is perfect on my shelf but wish there were more color options. I have a black shelf.
80275887,I wish you made a 2 x 5 one . I’ve used these for clients who have a lot of vinyl. I mean a lot. This unit never fails. 
20275814,As Advertised. This piece of storage shelving is easy to assemble and versatile to use.
20275814,"Great Shelves!. Love these shelves! They are easy to put together, and look great!"
60333954,Prefect size for what we needed. This piece works great in our bathroom. The corner edges look really nice. The size is perfect - not too big or too small. We use it for rolled towels.
60275812,Great shelf. This was a great shelving unit for my phonograph record collection. It was easy to assemble.
10345073,Beautiful and effective . It looks nice and holds all my mail without falling down.
10345073,"Kallax wire basket. I love the look of this accessory, not the functionality! The basket starts to get smaller towards the back, preventing file folders/crafting card stock from properly fitting. Ikea and product development need to reconfigure this product so it may properly be used with office folders and crafting paper."
50481172,Perfect for indoor or outdoor use. Bought one last spring to keep my plants one for my patio. Bought another for my Christmas village. After the holiday going to move it and put more plants on . It's a the perfect size.
50339292,Good for a TV table. Quick and easy to assemble the table is suitable for a TV.
90495695,"Amazing addition to cube storage. Honestly, it's a little bigger than 13x13 inches, but it fit okay (had to push it in really hard), but otherwise it's amazing. I was able to do so much with my cube storage!"
00415599,Storage and a stand for our bedreom TV!. We needed added storage for our bedroom and a stand for our small TV.  This has been perfect for both uses.
99017186,"Kallax fits any style. Love my Kallax! I bought two with the stands, and it has made an excellent display for my turntable and record collection. "
79442627,Good for the price. Easy to assemble. Size good for varying storage needs
20275814,Kallax Are The Best Shelving Organizers. Love these so much! They are so easy to assemble and look alot more expensive when you use matching bins.I have so many compliments on them.
10538849,"Well Worth The Effort. The quality is outstanding. My carpenter friend. challenge putting it together, but once he figured it out, it went together smoothly. The directions included are not always clear.  It is unique and adds a nice touch to the room!"
00275848,Fast from box to use. I’ve purchased a few variations of the Kallax and they are quick and easy to put together. Just a few minutes from the box to putting it to good use.
10487816,"Perfect Shelving. I have a lot of crafting projects, and these shelves perfectly suit the boxes where I store the projects. They are simple and low-profile and work well in my sewing room space. I am very happy with them (I got 2)."
60324520,"Great shelf. Exactly as expected. Seems very sturdy and it's not heavy, which is great!"
20275885,Great shelves. My teenager used this to organize space in her room.
90324509,So Happy with This Purchase. I bought this 5 x 5 Kallax to act as a room divider. Super pleased with how it turned out. The cubbies are actually wide enough for two rows of books. It's a big piece of furniture but holds a LOT of stuff.
79552908,"Determined To Get Organized. These were easy to assemble, great quality and exactly what I need to get organized!"
70332124,Clean and contemporary design EKET...using as nice stand.. Fairly straightforward assembly. You need to use a hammer with a cloth between the frame and hammer to get the seams on the miter corners to line up. Looks great once you make the seams match up!
80275887,"Versatile unit. The beauty of this system is how simple it is to assemble, and how versatile it is to fit multiple uses in multiple locations. I used two of these to provide organized storage inside a closet. And they are perfect for the job"
90286649,perfect storage accessory. Was quick and easy to assemble.  Adds some handy hidden storage to the great Kallax storage system.
10538849,"Great product!. I am very satisfied with this bookshelf. It has a clear instruction for installation, well thought design component, nice material and reasonable price. The only suggestion is the package should include wall anchor kit. (I ordered the wall anchor kit separately for free from website)"
10538849,Nice sturdy open shelving. Very pleasing shelf unit.  I bought 2
80512959,Fits the need. Was looking for a bookshelf to fill a space and provide some storage. This bookcase along with a few of accessory baskets sold by IKEA did the trick.
10305741,Kallax rocks. Beautiful shelving units. Got these to replace old Billy units that were falling apart. Looks great to store toys for the grandkids.
10538849,"Nice shelf. Good looking peace of furniture. It is suits well for my son's Lego collection. Easy to assemble, I handled it with my 10 years old son."
20275885,Great for my vinyl. I have 5 of these now. I prefer the 2 cube over the longer ones. Just feel it’s more sturdy with all the records. Hold around 80 LPs per cube depending on jacket thickness.
09481698,"So much storage space . This unit has so much storage space. I’m using it for a small playroom for a 6 and 4 yr old girls. It easily stores the all too many figurines, Barbie’s, accessories, Legos, small plush stuffies, craft supplies, etc."
79442627,Perfect piece. Easy to assemble. Looks sturdy and expensive. Can be changed up with insert boxes. 
49481700,Missing Pre-Drilled Holes. Mine is missing pre drilled holes for the connector pieces. I will have to go get a drill to fix it.
59481653,Great craft setup . My wife got this for a craft and sewing area
00275848,Nice book case!. Easy to assemble!
20275885,Great. Awesome storage solutions with several options!!
10305741,"Just OK. I'm not sure who gave the 5-star ratings. But, while simple enough to construct, peeling the thin plastic off the shelve edges takes longer than construction.  If they had a tab to grab it would have been OK, But with nothing to get you started, you struggle for a long time on each section to peel them. I had bought this in the past and didn't have to deal with the protective coverings. Based on that alone, I will not buy more of these."
40303439,Perfect. Fit perfect for the room it was ment for 
20278167, Convenient . Love how you can do more with these kallax inserts
20275814,beautiful spacious shelf!. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. such beautiful quality and easy assembly :)
80401292,"Exactly what I needed!. Well made, easy to put together."
29442677,PERFECT OFFICE ADDITION. I love love love this product....so well made and looks beautiful in my office.  The squares are so big and the bamboo gnabbas are a perfect to store all my small business products! Highly recommend.
10305741,"Love!. I wasn’t so sure about the white gloss finish, but I absolutely love this look! I use for my craft room and craft storage and it fits everything I need plus more!"
30275861,Great storage solution. The Kallax cube storage is very sturdy and easy to put together.  
90301555,Versatile furniture. Love the Kallax cubes. Double cube can be used vertically or horizontally due to all sides finished the same.
80401292,Many uses. I use these for storage other than wine!!!!
80275887,Great products for kids storage . Use of additional box containers to store all kids toys
20409936,"great for the value, easy. great for the value, easy to assemble"
00415599,It looks great. It looks great
29278304,Love them!. I bought two & LOVE them!
80401292,"Fantastic for craft supplies!. This is so so so handy for storing my wool fiber I use for felting! It makes everything easily visible, organized, accessible and beautiful. Love it!"
80275887,Kallex 8 cube. Love it as a paper sorter it helped me organize my craft space. Very easy to assemble.
50214678,Wonderful piece.. Shelving unit provided replacement of wire cubes used in college dorm. 2 shelves were placed in mstrbdroom closet to provide folded clothes & boxed shoes storage. Size; easily put together; and Tinted shelves were reasons for purchase. Very pleased with product & results it provided to our storage dilemna.
79442694,"Perfect Storage Unit. We needed this to get all of our decorations for the seasons stored in one place. Easy to put together and quick, I think it took us just under an hour. We bought non-Ikea 13"" cubes and they fit in perfectly. Super happy with the base too, takes it a couple inches off the ground to look like a ""real"" piece of furniture."
80334603,"NOT HARD! I have some tips. I will post the same review on each eket I bought because I am lazy. These are NOT hard to put together. Really! 1: GRAB A MALLET! I couldn't find mine anywhere but after putting one together without one and getting frustated, I realized that Ikea made these to fit so tightly together it's just not worth doing it without. I ran to my local hardware store. 2: START WITH SIDE LABELED 1! The easiest way for me to see it was keeping the four sides together and looking for 1. But 1 is ALWAYS a piece with plastic pegs. ALWAYS. The pieces without pegs are what I think of as sides 2 & 3. 3: When putting on sides 2, put the round peg all the way into the round hole, if you only get it halfway in and slide; take it out; do it again. After the round peg is in the round hole, I grabbed the eket booklet, put it on top of the joint I was joining & pounded it until it was flat. This worked without fail. Repeat for side 3. 4: Slide the backing in sticker on the outside. Put side 4 in"
00314642,Kaylax drawers. It is a nice addition to the cube.
60275812,Great product. Das
40415601,"Lesser quality than previous years. For anyone who has bought these over the years, you can immediately tell that the quality has gone down significantly from years past. Most of the wood is now semi-hollow and made of particle board basically. If you tighten a screw too much, it can easily break loose - the wood fails long before there is any chance of hurting the screw.  These obviously still work, and provide what I need, but I do not expect my recent purchase of these to last as long as my older purchases of the same item."
40415601,"Really like these!. I have a number of these bookshelves in my home. I put two 4x2s with a 3x3 to use as a TV wall unit. You basically end up with an expensive built in look without the expensive price,"
00415599,Great for storage!. This went together easily and is strong and sturdy!!
09294526,"Perfect storage solution. These units are the perfect solution for storing small kitchen appliances in a breakfast nook. Living in an apartment, my kitchen just didn't have the counter space for my small appliances. The height and size is perfect, I was able to fit two of these along a breakfast area wall. Now I have extra storage, plus a cute coffee area."
89386107,Pay Attention to Assembly. One of the panels is labeled (1)  They all look identical but this one has different groves.  If you don’t assemble correctly in reference to that 1 piece you will not be able to get the backing on!   Overall assembly was easy once I realized that I missed that KEY information!
89386107,This thing was so hard. This thing was so hard to put together. You would think the peg hole system would make it easier. I ended up returning it because the top would not sit flush.
79902657,"Awesome Sturdy and well made. I've had this item for over a year and it still looks as good as the day I bought it home. I have it in my room and it serves as my home office. The shelving unit is study, I have books, DVD player, cable box, many pictures and other heavy items on the bottom and this shelf holds them like a more expensive wood piece. It looks good in my room and makes the room fell airy and big. Awesome unit. It took my daughter and I less than an hour to put both pieces together. They are separate, so you don't have to keep them together, although I have them together."
20275814,The product is great. Assembly. The product is great. Assembly was a bit of a challenge as the holes didn't line up for the final screws. We had to take it apart and shorten the dowels to get the final holes to line up. It was fine after that.
20275814,"Cats love it. My cat has allergies and so do I so trying to get away from anything that doesn’t fit in washing machine, I added legs to this and put it in the window for Stella to have a bed on top to watch the birds and Mrs Wolowitz loves the cat house insert in a lower cube!!"
20423720,Perfect!. Just what Kallax needs to make it practical in my art studio!
20423720,Great asset to Kallax. Love how you can adjust your Kallax to different needs with these add-ons.
20423720,"Works fine but not perfect. 1. I really want to see other color options, matching all colors available for Kallax cubes. 2. I'd also love to see more configurations, because 1 shelf is too generous, and 3 shelves are too tight for my needs (sheet music). May be, pre-drilled inserts with additional shelves sold separately to allow configurations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 shelves at customer discretion. 3. It would be nice if these inserts were compatible with door inserts. And it is a little bit expensive in my opinion."
20423720,A little disappointed.. The Kallax cube divider works horizontally or vertically. There were a couple cubes the divider was an extremely difficult to get in and other cubes it slid right in. My only issue was one of the holes the pegs go in was so close to the edge it split slightly when the peg was inserted.
10275862,"Great value. We own several of the smaller units and wanted something larger for our bedroom. What we like most is the volume that the unit holds, yet it's not an overwhelmingly heavy piece of furniture."
99017186,Not exactly what I wanted. This is the 3rd Kallax shelving unit I bought and was disappointed that I couldn’t get the black doors I wanted. I have the black on the other ones and wanted the same for this one. I had to settle for white.
20275885,"VERSATILE, ATTRACTIVE, STURDY. We are using these wall units in different configurations, and for different purposes. In our bonus room on the side to hold a large screen TV with cubbys for storage, then flanked vertically. In our home office as a wall unit, as well as on top of a desk return on it’s side. Just love them!"
10305741,Best Bookcase on the Market!. THis is the thrid KALLAX bookcase I have purchased. This latest purchase was for my college-age son for his room. He loves is KALLAX bookcase. We bought the cube bins for each square of the bookcase. He is currently using this bookcase en lieu of a dresser.
90495596,Love it. Keeps my Kallax unit offf the floor. 
00275848,"Simple, easy and quick. nice shelving unit using in the laundry."
10305741,Ideal for Quick and Easy Storage. The Gloss White Kallax system is perfect in a number of configurations for storage in my modern home. The loft lifestyle come with very little storage solutions. IKEA has made shirt work of those concerns
00324518,"Super awesome shelf. I waited for this specific shelf/color to be in stock. It's my first Kallax shelf. First Ikea piece of furniture for that matter. It is exactly what I'd hoped. Durable, looks great, all the parts fit together perfectly (not like other brands) and it's light in weight. I'd get it again."
79294542,. Hardest part was unpacking it in the car because it was too heavy for me. Looks really good.
40415192,"Sturdy shelf. We purchased two of these for our dining room since we are lacking storage here in Florida. They were easy for one person even to put together and took no time at all to assemble. I was surprised with the quality of the shelf, they turned out very nice!"
09017483,"Nice, but don't deviate. It's hard to compete with Ikea. Great looks, great price. I purchased thinking this line - Eket and Kallax, were compatible with each other. No, that's not the case at all. That bit cost me $70 in accessories that I won't be getting back. Otherwise the shelving looks great."
70286645,"Kallax Drawers. Already had the shelving unit, the drawers fit really well. It's nice that you can change up the unit and reconfigure it."
20275885,Just the right size. Very sturdy. . The Kallax hold LPs. It is just the right size. Great way to display your albums!
49481658,The Perfect Desk!. This desk came in different sizes and was perfect for the space I needed. It has a lot of storage shelves without looking bulky. SO glad I bought!!!
29481659,"Space and storage with a sleek look!. Love this desk! I can’t believe I didn’t get it sooner. It offers 2 looks, You’ll love it too!"
90305803,"Wobbly. This shelf looks nice and offers the storage that I needed, but it is super wobbly - like moves at least an inch side to side wobbly. I’m debating if I want to go through the hassle of exchanging it or just deal with the wobbly-ness…"
90305803,"Wobbly. Extremely wobbly. Screws are tighted as best they can. Difficult to assemble, will need a drill bit to create holes for screws."
50214678,"Good Quality for Price!. I own multiple of these shelves, and they have been pretty sturdy and help up so far. The quality seems pretty good and it is easy to clean and maintain.  Pros: + Easy to assemble. + Bars and glass shelves feel sturdy. + Looks good / simple to fit into most places.  Cons: - Wooden top and bottom shelf panels can scratch easily (but like typical Ikea furniture). - You cannot buy replacement parts individually if something breaks."
70286645,"Kallax Insert. Kallax inserts are the best, provides different looks for storage "
40346924,Versatility is the Key. The Hallax worked out in every room we placed it. The additional accessories avaible by Ikea to enhance the Hallax is awesome. More future purchases to come. 
70342199,Love the industrial design. We have the matching low shelf unit in this series and this piece works great with that one on the same wall. Excellent value for the amount of storage it provides.
10305741,Great storage. Easy to assemble and sturdy. Lo e the gloss finish.
50339292,Love the industrial design. This series is a perfect style for my sons room. He really likes the doors and the combination of wood and metal. Great price for the amount of storage it provides.
20278167,"Update is good, not great. I'd purchased Kallax door inserts some years ago, and at the time they were difficult to position and added a lot of weight to the shelves. The new version is much lighter and easier to position and attach, but the material beyond the door is a bit too flimsy. One of the new doors doesn't quite match up with the frame, and on none of the doors does the silicon bumper make a difference in noise emitted by closing it. But I like them anyway!"
90301555,"An Interesting and Useful Piece. I didn't believe the IKEA guy when he said that it could easily hold 33 lbs. It is so lightweight, smooth and pretty, and I had no idea what it was when I saw it on my way to check out, but maybe it could solve the problem of my microwave oven cord being too short to fit any of my electric outlets while placed on any counter or current furniture. Actually, it is built to hold up to 50 lbs. It fit under the end of my breakfast bar near the electric outlet, and my microwave fits neatly on top. The cubbies below can hold items too big for my cupboards. It wipes off nicely."
10409932,". I bought this a couple of days ago and when I opened the boxes, I only found the wooden parts. There were no assembly instructions. Also the hardware parts like the screws and stuff was missing. How am I supposed to assemble it now??"
50214678,Best shelf ever ... I have 3 of this shelf and I loved the quality
20275885,Kallax. Good for storing my vinyl albums. 
99490274,"Bad engineered design. . These are nice from the way they look, however, the engineering appears to be done by someone who had a brief lapse in the basics of physics.  Specifically, three sides connect together by aligning preset connectors into pre-drilled holes then sliding about 1/2 in. to lock into place.  You then slide the back piece into a pre-cut groove in each of the three sides.  Easy-peasy.  The problem arises when attaching the final side.  As the starting position to align the connectors to the pre-drilled holes is about 1/2 higher than the final placement once the connecters are slid into the locking position, the back does not therefore line up with the pre-cut groove in the final piece  This prevents the connectors from being able to fully go into the pre-drilled holes, and not allowing then to slide down into locked position.    Extremely, extremely frustrating.  Simple pre-drilled holes and screws would make a tighter fit and take minutes to assemble. "
50339292,I love it. Love it but I’m not super handy and we didn’t realize we needed to make holes in the 2 boards but I did it.
10345073,Didn’t  work out . Not quite what I expected 
20275814,"Assembly Disaster. Many wooden dowels snapped while trying to put together, IKEA should provide extras. The instructions are poor, the direction of the boards is facing is important but there’s little to guide you until it’s too late. I basically made every misstep possible, ruined my evening and damaged some of the shelf. Wish they’d try a little harder with the instructions and provide extra dowels."
00275848,"Ultimate utility. I've been using various Kallax combinations for years, including turning five-shelf giant into a kitchen pantry. I currently have five separate shelving units in my apartment to provide storage for all sorts of things. They're sturdy and spacious and easy to assemble. I can't imagine my home without them."
00324518,Love the self. I love the shelf but the accuracy of what is on the selves vs what is showing online has not been correct the last two times I drove all the way to the store so pick up the item I was looking for. We aware of this! It is quite annoying!
20473593,Just what we needed. We've been looking for something nicer to store our cats' food and this fit every perfectly. We have a few other Ikea pieces so it worked in space. Really liked the mix of metal and wood. Also my husband didn't have too much trouble putting it together.
59189033,"Don’t buy these!. Bought them almost 2yrs ago, just now getting around to putting them up! Yay quarantine!!! If you do the math it $22.50 per cube, 1/3 of them broke, or the backing was too tall or too wide, therefore not being able to fully assemble. Unless you want a janky looking cube with no back. Which we resorted to! For $22 a cube, you EXPECT better!"
89435221,"Perfect size and good mix with Besta, Billy, Kallax. Variety is the spice of life. And also to a room layout.   A mix-up of Eket and Besta, using those series small- and medium-sized cabinets, has given life and spark to what would otherwise be a long, narrow, windowless, low (aka dark and boring) wall in our lounge/family/media room.   The scale of the two series is a perfect complement to the room’s dimensions. And building a rhythm of cabinet heights, all in a line, looks artful, but is still easily aligned to carrying our large flat screen.   Having Eket available for the room’s furnishing definitely makes the room pop.  In another room, a small office/projects room, five Eket, single- and double- doored cabinets, line the walls across from a low run of Kallax units. A short, narrow Billy, is popped in among the Ekets.   Three shallow, single-door Ekets have been stacked up (easy and safe to do with the Eket wall brackets. TY, Ikea!), in a corner just behind the room’s door. The stack works like a tall utility cabinet, without the tall utility cabinet aesthetic (love it).   Otherwise, on other wall two two-door Ekets do storage and display duty , one under a loved painting, the other under a window.   TY, IKEA, for adding the EKET series to your cabinets. Their scale and variety is a game changer."
10275862,Kallax. Surprisingly light but very sturdy. It takes time to assemble but is well worth it in the end.
10275862,"Kallax awesome product. Great product. I have many. Durable, cost efficient."
89285820,"Simple, sturdy, clean lines. Simple, sturdy, clean lines"
10409932,Kallax shelf. Looks great. I bought 4 in various sizes.
30324507,"It's all right, but you have to install and handle with care. The door and the insert fit perfectly size-wise, however, the doors are hard to align perfectly. Additionally, the screws are so short that if you don't watch out you might pull the door out of its socket. Then, it's impossible to put it back."
80401292,"Kallax is very versatile . We have sevaral Kallax units with various configurations and we love them all. They are decorative yet very practical shelving units for storage of anything with the insertable dividers, cabinet, drawers, baskets and boxes."
40423719,Awesome. Works great! Sturdy and functional. 
80275887,Kallax. Love this Kallax and the base set.  Made a cutting table for my sewing room using two of each. This was much more cost friendly than buying a cutting table.
40415601,Love Kallax. Out of all the ikea furniture we have kallax is the most sturdy. 
10487816,"Quietly classic, adjustable, and sturdy. We currently have the bookshelves in two places in our home—group of 4 lined up in a low attic space and another as a single bookshelves and display in an open-door closet—but we chose them for their versatility over time. In the future, I can see us using a shelf for holding records or as an entryway drop zone. They work great in a bank or as a single piece and the adjustable feet are a must for our old homes’ sloping floors."
40303439,"Spacious and elegant shelves. I love these shelves. Actually I bought four of them for my plant room! I had concern based on reviews I read that they may not be stable but I had no problem. I keep heavy terracotta pots on each one and they seem firm in place. They look very pretty and they can accommodate a lot of pots of things, but in the same time they don’t look too big. Highly recommend! "
10305741,"Love it! . You can use it horizontal or vertical. Excellent size to use with or without baskets, both or none. "
40415601,Good sturdy product. Good sturdy product
60275812,"Great Shelving. I bought this as an option for shelving and organization in my bathroom. It does come out about 10 inches, so need to plan appropriately for over the toilet (if that's where you are hanging it). The depth makes it great for towels and other items that you might place in containers.  It was really easy to assemble.  I also painted it to match with the decor in my bathroom. "
09275085,Good shelf.. Good shelf.
20473593,Perfect stand for 2 printers. I needed a stand to hold both printers in a limited workspace. The storage at the bottom is a plus.
89275091,Sturdy and good looking. This piece did exactly what I wanted it to do. It was easy to put together. I recommend this bookcase.
49275088,I love the color! Sturdy. I love the color! Sturdy furniture.
89275091,"Love it!. Bought 2 of the Havsta cabinets and 2 open shelves for my office/craft room. I can stash all my supplies in the cabinet and display my books, photos and other pretty things on the shelves. The cabinet is deep enough to hold lots of things. Great sturdy wood for the price."
20473593,"Great design, slightly tricky assembly. I love the look and practicality of the unit. I deducted a star because assembly was a little tricky. The shelves do not have pre drilled holes and instead you have to use sharp screws provided to cut into the wood yourself, while also holding the wood in place even though it doesn't sit perfectly flush (you have to assess whether it is even on both sides). Eventually I got it well enough, but this could be improved."
09275085,Great Sturdy Bookshelf. This is great piece. It looks expensive (but was not) it's even better than I expected. Perfect for the space we needed and came fast.
09275085,perfect for price. looks great and great quality!
49275088,Good quality and appearance.. Good quality and appearance.
49275088,Good Quality Bookcase!. A sturdy bookcase and just the size for what I needed.  Another helpful product from Ikea.
70286645,Super convenient. Bought these to use in the 4 cube Kallax system in my nursery closet. Works good as extra organized baby storage. Wouldn’t trust it with a full heavy load or things with liquids/oils.
30275861,Perfect for everyone . Easy to ensamble  Help to save space in my room Kallax is perfect for different uses.
20275814,"Good Product, one suggestion. I love the Kaplan system. I wish it came with covers for the screws/turn locks. Or at least a purchase option through IKEA. Stickers or plastic inserts. They’re such an eyesore and if I want them covered I have to track a solution down online and order hoping they fit"
70309840,"Printer stand. We needed a small stand for our printer and this works great. It’s sturdy, was easy to assemble and we can store paper in it."
49189203,"Doesn't come with connectors. I ordered this set as pictured- with the cubed shelf connected to the one tall one with the door. I knew this would need to be connected, but nowhere in the description or ""good to know"" section told me that I needed to order the connectors as well. I've purchased similar furniture from IKEA in the past and connectors were provided for those. Not sure why this one doesn't come with it. It's really inconvenient because I had all parts delivered, and now I'm missing the connectors and need to make a trip out."
00324518,Flexible Product. I love that I can use this both vertically and horizontally.  Wide enough to use as a multiple dresser/tv stand in bedroom and have them vertically on the ends to make as a nice unit 
20275814,Still amazing after all these years. . I now have it in all colors and shapes. Probably THE best stackable cube shelving ever made. Looks cleans and sleek. Amazing quality. Easy to assemble. White is my newest - love it!
60278170,Was annoying . Was a lot of screws into the wood 
60275812,"Easy to mount. Looks great, different ways to adjust for needs with divders and drawers, easy to mount, decent price."
20213312,"Top & bottom shelves are. Top & bottom shelves are a wood based material, and are supposed to be screwed onto the shelves. Unfortunately, I didn't have a drill and the material is super dense, so I wasn't able to use a punch to create a pilot hole for the screws.  The other issue I ran into, it was a me problem most likely, was that 2 of the posts have holes that need to be aligned with each other - but are otherwise identical. I missed this fact, despite reading the instructions before attempting assembly, and had to partially disassemble the unit to correct the mistake.  Nice aesthetic, overall."
20275885,Great product. Love that Kallax comes in different shapes with different add-ons.
40303439,Beautiful. It is a versatile and elegant shelving unit that effortlessly combines functionality with a sleek design.
80275887,Very good use in our. Very good use in our closet
00415599,Awesome. Great alternative as an attractive storage solution.
00275848,Used in the closet. Used in the closet
49189203,Great entry area cabinet. I'm using this in my back door entry for shoes and recycling. It looks great and holds a lot. Some of the pieces put up some resistance during assembly. I used a rubber mallet and very gentle taps to get them set. Not all parts needed that. If you decide to buy taller feet you'll need 8 total. I bought a 4 pack and had to order another. The cubes and the cabinet don't attach to each other so they need their own feet.
49189203,"Bad. it nearly impossible to assemble without destroying it, and it is totally incompatible with the glass window in the same series."
49189203,"Assembly makes this piece not worth it. I bought this piece with expectations for assembly to be similar to the things I have bought from Ikea in the past - not the easiest but also not terrible if you have time and patience. However the assembly for this piece is honestly like torture. There really aren't any screws involved with this piece of furniture, just a lot of meeting the plastic ends in the holes and pushing them down to make it align. The pieces are not easy to align at all, I had to resort to a hammer which did the trick but damaged the piece of furniture itself so now I have a damaged piece of furniture, and good luck trying to get the last/final piece matched up and put together. Price is great and its not a bad piece but if I would have known what the assembly process would've been like before I purchased this I would not have bought it. Also, the door to my cabinet is unaligned due to bad pre-made holes and there's been nothing I can do to align it."
80275887,Kallax units. I love the Kallax cubicles for all of my craft room storage needs. Storage is neat and maximizes the space.
20275885,Great storage unit. Great quality for the price. It was easy to assemble. It's great for organizing my kiddos' rooms.
50305739,Work great. Excellent for the price!. Use this as a coffee bar area in our home bar.
20409936,Great unit. It was easy to assemble and fits perfectly in the spot I had designated.
50214678,Love it. Purchased one awhile ago and a friend loved it so have it to them and bought another 
19278253,Great. Kallax looks great and is super sturdy. It was also easy to put together.
40501892,Base for Kallax. Works perfectly with the Kallax cube shelving.
90305803,looks beautiful. It added the chic minimalistic vibe I was going for. LOVE it. The only thing I had an issue with was that the wood slabs for the top and bottom shelves did not have the premade holes. I ended up leaving it as is because I don't have an electric drill to puncture the holes with the screws.
70286645,Functional . Loved adding these to our 8 cube shelves. What use to be shoved in a bin is now better organized in  drawers. Love. Easy to install too
00275848,We hung them sideways in. We hung them sideways in the garage. Great shelves!
70483274,Shelf tiny. Love the item just wish the shelves were more adjustable.
60221683,Versatile Shelving. I have now purchased five of these shelves with intentions to buy more. I love the ability to adjust the shelves however needed to fit my items.
70483274,"Ehh….. Shelves are wonderful, but the assembly process was terrible. Instructions were too basic, no words to help. Half the time it shows holes for the wood and other times it doesn’t. The screws didn’t screw, the little things that connect the shelves didn’t work until you push as hard as you can (using 3 people). Overall the shelves work, but if you struggle with putting things together, I would just pay the assembly fee."
70483274,Easy to assemble. These book cases were the easiest to assemble and are pretty sturdy.
60221683,"Great shelf but not for the new price!!. I bought this self a year and a half ago and it was at least $125 less. It’s a nice shelf, but it’s not worth $250. I was going to purchase another one bc I use the current one for plants and I wanted another shelf for more plants."
70483274,"Uniqueness makes this interesting as display wal. Using two of these as a display wall. The varying widths and shelving distance make for an interesting look. This is pressed board, not solid wood. The shelving supports are a bit short so keep heavy stuff on bottom or the support middle shelves. Looks good. Happy with purchase"
70483274,Looks really nice. I bought two of these. I was able to put them together by myself in about 3 hours and that is with toddlers helping me. 😂 You need space to put them together. They are actually quite big. I like that the shelves can be varying and makes for a pleasant look. Overall seems very sturdy and definitely thinking about adding another small one.
90286649,I decided to change the. I decided to change the look of my Kallax and these inserts did the trick. The versatility of the Kallax makes it the perfect choice as a storage solution.
20275885,Kallax for LP record storage. Works great for record storage.  Be sure to attach to wall using included brackets or diy a rear cross brace to keep unit sturdy due to weight.  
90495596,very good buy.. super easy to set up and use. I love the ability to raise my Kallax units just a bit off the floor. looks great too
80275887,Always my go-to for shelving. I now have it in all colors and shapes. Probably THE best stackable cube shelving ever made. Looks cleans and sleek. Amazing quality. Easy to assemble. White is my newest - love it!
70286645,Perfect for the money.. The product is perfect for the storage solution we were looking for on our porch.
40501892,Kallax. LOVE this product from IKEA! By using the stand for the Kallax shelving I was able to use this furniture in a more nontraditional way in my sewing room.
60275812,Perfect in every way!!. This has to be my tenth unit! Easy to assemble in minutes and start putting to good use!!
60510862,"Useful in every space.. IKEA’s little boxes, one called the EKET,  are strong, attractive in several colors, are great in every room, including the garage. They can be attached to each other to create various shapes, or be used simply alone or stacked."
80275887,Easy to assemble. Perfect storage. Easy to assemble. Perfect storage for my art/craft studio.
70286645,Great kallax accessory. Simple to assemble. Works well for baby clothes.
70301537,great product. great product
99932540,"Love . Please do not discontinue the FJALKINGE shelf unit with drawers!! This is one of my favorite ikea designs.  I love it’s simplicity and practicality, it works in either a living room or bedroom. I also like how there is flexibility in where you put the shelves and drawers (I install the drawers lower). This piece is tall and shallow so it gives you lots of storage without taking up much room. But those proportions also make it unstable so you really should secure this one to a wall. "
60275812,I love this shelf style. This brand/style of shelves is exactly what I want and need.  It’s so nice and perfect for my taste.  
90286649,"Function and design. This insert provides a more organized use for my unit and adds a pleasing appearance too. Overall, very happy with product."
90495596,Lifts the cube boxes up just right. . The base fits the cabinet boxes well. Lifts off the floor for neater look. Looks clean. 
60324520,"Well made, very accurate. The shelves went together easily, even though I assembled it in an upright position, because I worked alone (oh, I broke a peg, but you thoughtfully included a spare).  The pieces were very accurate, and fit perfectly.  I wish you had more options for wall attachment though, to make up for thickness of the wall baseboard (I had to put shims in, to make up for the gap)."
80275887,Sturdy shelvin. Great looking with baskets 
00275848,Love it. This was just what I was looking for.
70391038,"Very nice piece. . Love this piece. It’s very sturdy, well made and looks very nice in my room. "
90305803,"Good price and sturdy . Good price,Easy to assemble and very sturdy. "
20275814,"Love them!. These shelves are stylish, sturdy and easy to put together. The greatest thing is that I purchased two sets of them on sale! "
30495599,Perfect fit. Just the right height and fit for the space.
20275814,Good Quality . Excellent product
40423719,Works great . Love it
20275885,"Ikea changes Expedit dimensions to meet new eco goals. As an owner of several Expedit shelving unit I thought those were marvelously cost efficient and sturdy units. I finally had to break down and buy the smaller Kallax units when the need for new storage arose. The Kallax is basically a slightly smaller exterior dimension version of the Expeditor with the same interior storage shelf dimensions. However, the new units feel distinctly less robust and the exterior finish cladding also seems a bit cheaper looking. I understand that Ikea will save considerable wood product given the enormous volume of Kallax that they sell worldwide, but I still lament the passing of the better quality Expedit."
99017445,Great storage and nice looking. We bought this for additional storage and added some bins it gave us the storage we were looking for but was also so nice looking fit in perfectly with our decor.
70301542,"Solid as expected. Easy to put together. I added 3 2x4’s horizontal on the back to reinforce it, and screed the 2x4’s on studs in the wall. It’s nice and solid and ready for a large LP collection."
80401292,"wine storage. worked beautifully, just wished it came in expresso to match my EXPEDIT shelves"
70301537,"Great Divide!. My three granddaughters share a huge room. The oldest wanted a little more separation from her twin sisters. This was the perfect option! Canvas bins in the lower rows replaced her dresser, and the remaining cubbies hold her books and treasures."
70301537,"perfect pantry storage!. I bought this shelving unit to use in my walk-in pantry and I bought the corresponding cabinets w/door, wine insert and the insert that makes one cubby into two. I put this together (not including the inserts I bought separately) in about 2 hours because I took my time. I would also use a rubber mallet if you have one. It makes it so much easier to tap in the wooden dowels which connects each section. It takes two people to lift it and it includes safety anchors that keep it from falling. The optional inserts give this shelving unit a customized look and I love the 15-inch depth which allows each cubby to hold more items than a regular bookshelf. I wish these IKEA reviews allowed for pictures to be posted but I couldn't see where that was an option. My pantry looks so organized and bright now! I love it."
80334603,"Eket. Works great for my 12""x12"" paper pads."
50214678,Weird name . Very beautiful and sturdy easy to assemble 
10487816,"Happy i got it. Easy assembly, very lovely, good for record players, above the average shelf. I like having this in my life. The shelves are white metal & the sides are light wood :)"
00314642,"Great Quality. Excellent material, easy to assemble, looks good, great addition "
70286645,"Great for storage, Clean look. I love these drawers! I replaced my bins with them and they are so great for the little things for a seamless look"
30275861,"Awesome!. Good quality, easy to assemble with help."
50324511,TO ADD  TO A LITTLE BIT OF THIS.... These worked out perfectly for the little one to access all toys that fit in these. We got him four sets and he loves that they belong only to him...worked out perfectly. 
30324507,ADDED TO A LITTLE BIT OF THIS . Good for hiding what does not need to be seen for a sleeker/neater look
10324513,Little bit of this a little bit of that..... We also got the doors and drawers for this for the little one to put his toys...love it!!! Thankful for the options! :) 
89221055,It makes my playroom organize. It makes my playroom organize and looks amazing
80487813,"what a POS. this product is awful. No instructions. wood broke immediately. Totally garbage,. I threw it away and there';s no way I'm paying for it"
20275885,"Love the Kallax bookcase. Bought 2 of these bookcases. One I laid sideways to use as a TV cabinet, the other one is a bookcase for my office. They both look great and are sturdy. Easy to put together. Delivered on time in excellent shape. Price very reasonable."
10409932,Have these all over the house. Love all the options with the cube storage.  This one is extra cool because I grabbed them on a clearance sale!
39442686,"Easy to put together, aesthetically pleasing. easy to build but sturdy."
60278170,"Very Nice Look. I have the 4 x 4 Kallax in my office area and added a combination of doors and drawers. The doors were easy to install and look absolutely great. They give my office a clean and orderly look. They seem solid, so I expect they will last."
60275812,Perfect. Works great in our new office design.
40324516,"Wonderful and versatile!!. We purchased two of these for our sunroom to hold our many many books haha! We not only have created an oasis of a library but a place for our plants to thrive on leaving enough space for a beanbag chair to get cozy to read! These are great because you don’t have to buy the frame to lay this on its side like we did. You can stand these upright and they would work great for storing things anywhere in the home. It could work in the kitchen for extra storage, could work in the dining room for holding China or commonly used items. It could also be a display place or put baskets in for hidden away functionality. It can be used I. The living room to give the illusion of an entertainment center if you put one on either side of your tv stand or used to put books in like we did :) sturdy, easy to take apart and re-assemble if you need to move it. Two thumbs up 👍🏽 "
40501892,Great to add to the book case to widen your possibilities!. Great to attach to the books case and makes it even more versatile to use :)
99017186,I love my Kallax. I have about 6 through out my home I love it love it love it
00275848,"Just what I needed. This is a sturdy product with a small footprint. I was worried it would be wobbly since it has no stabilizing back, but it's great! It gave me plenty of extra storage space within and on top. I purchased fabric storage cubes that fit exactly in the openings and was even able to color-coordinate them with the room."
90286649,Loved it. Easy to put together 
20278167,"Truly terrible!!!. I generally don't have any complaint about putting together IKEA furniture and the 4x4 Kallax shelf I bought for this to go into was easy and straightforward to assemble. These inserts are a terror, however. It's basically just a scored piece of very thin MDF that you attach to the sides of the shelf with short screws. Except it is virtually impossible to get the screws to go all the way in, leaving the cabinet door lopsided. Just by the basket inserts and call it a day."
70286645,"got this to go with. got this to go with my Kallax shelving, so the unit would be more than just a bookshelf. Perfect for things I don't want on display."
80275887,"Great shelving!. Easy to build, great price, looks sleek, what's not to like?"
00324518,"Great price!. Fantastically versatile product! Great price, just wish they kept more in stock."
30495599,"Easy to assemble and gets kallax off the floor. These were super easy to assemble. I appreciate they came with additional hardware for the kallax if you're adding them to a unit you already have at home. If you're assembling both a kallax and the base on the same day, assemble the base first because you'll have to change the last step of your kallax unit build."
40501892,What???. I have a Kallax unit I wanted off the floor. Bought this base and it does not fit the old Kallax.
00275848,Good quality for the money. The parts fit well. Order the shelf dividers to get more space for small things. 
70286645,Drawer . Great product 
20275814,"Poor Materials. Kallax had poor materials and poor fit. Assembly relied on long, thin wooden rods to connect some of the shelves together, but rods that easily snap and often poorly fit together. Even the wooden rods that didn't snap left the the shelves very flimsy. Ikea really cheaped out here because screws or metal rods would have fixed these issues."
20275814,Horrible. There was half of a broken piece in the screws bag so I went to Ikea to get a new piece. Came back home and I see the other half of the broken piece in the furniture piece which was impossible to take out. Now I have to go back to ikea for a whole new furniture piece. Ikea is very unorganized.
80275887,Perfect hall shelving. The product was great for shelves in an entrance hallway. Good quality and value.
30530574,"Perfect for records. I love how customizable Eket is to design. The planner was very easy to use. It is very sturdy in place. I was pleasantly surprised that tools were not required to put Eket together, but only to attach to the wall."
30530574,Cube sidetablr. We bought two for floating side tables and they turned out awesome.
70332124,Books. I now have 4 of these and plan to get more. They fit my books perfectly. I have plans to add the glass doors and connect them to make a set of built ins.
40334558,"Great quality great price. Super easy to put together, very durable and easy to hang! So many options to use these!"
70391038,"Looks great and fits perfectly. I purchased 2 of these with the matching tv stand and they fit perfectly on my wall. Everything is solid wood, not often found with ""build yourself"" furniture. The color is closer to black than dark brown but I love it even more than I would have liked a brown. It looks amazing against the brick wall giving just the right balance in colors. It is nice and tall and solid. I was able to put these together by myself and I am only 5'2"". There are only 2 times a second person is needed but can be worked around."
20275885,GREAT!. Easy to assemble & can be used in multiple ways! We decided to lay it horizontally and use in our living room as a tv stand. Also purchased the GNABBAS to go along with it.
00275848,"KALLAX is perfect for my needs!. KALLAX shelving and it’s inserts are attractive, versatile, and space-efficient, easily expandable and uniquely designed to fit perfectly with other units to fill all your storage requirements. Start your own collection of KALLAX now!"
20213312,Just what I needed. It’s a great shelf for what I needed. Easy to assemble and just looks great
00324518,"Perfect for certain storage requirements. We have several of these units, two in a crafting room, one in a guest bedroom.  They are perfect for certain specific storage needs.  Very solid, substantial.  Nice, consistent finish.  "
20213312,The shelf is excellent. It. The shelf is excellent. It is exactly as pictured. My husband said that actual ease of setup was ok but the instructions were not always clear. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and will be buying more.
20213312,"hands down, the best money spent. I've had two of these now for about 5yrs now and I absolutely love them! They look so high-end. The glass shelves hold much more than I anticipated. I have a lot of books and some big, heavy, anthology-type books. I've had so many compliments on them. I do remember putting them together and it wasn't the worst experience. I did it by myself; just remember to not tighten everything until it's all assembled. They do seem a bit wobbly but with all the weight I have on them I don't think they'll tip. I did anchor them to the wall so that really helps."
20213312,Very nice and sturdy. Looks. Very nice and sturdy. Looks high end
40303439,"Vittsjo white. Awesome product! Striking and beautiful in my home! Looks expensive! So far I really like it! Using for plants. I couldn’t find the directions so put it together myself as I could figure it out by the picture on the website. My husband had to put the screws into the wood for me. Didn’t take too long to put together. I laid out the pieces where they looked like they fit, double checked everything before putting it together. Price was good. Shipping cost was extremely high so drove 3.5 hours each way to pick up in person. There were no extra pieces at all so be extremely careful that none are lost. Bottom line is I really like it and how it looks. Hope it lasts a long time."
40303439,"Love it. Easy to assemble, looks great as a plant stand! Bought a 2nd for books!"
20213312,Great for plant stand. Great for plant stand
40275846,Beautiful unit. I used these units to create a matching bed frame and side table. They're very sturdy and perfect for my needs.
00388633,"Nice bookcase-lots of cardboard & packing. I would rate the book case as very nice, typical Ikea. Assembly was the usual Ikea pita, but all parts fit with no problems. Took me a couple of hours - it's much easier with better tools like a ratchet or power screwdriver.  This is packaged in two boxes (one very long - the height of the unit.). The two generated a large, maybe shocking amount of cardboard waste. In addition to the boxes there is quite a bit of internal packing material. Yeah... all recyclable, but after cutting it up to small pieces and collapsing the packing it still took almost half of my weekly recycling bin.  There must be a better way, but I don't know what it is. So down one star for the mess made."
40415601,There was a dent on the side.. The dent is next to the wall so we didn’t return it.
40501892,Storage Lift Up. We are pleased with the height of the product and it's the perfect lift up for our storage needs! 
20278167,"Lasts 2 days. I built the shelf and put the insert doors in on Sunday. It is now Tuesday and, within those two days, 3 of the 8 doors have completely ripped off leaving huge holes. It is basically hard cardboard inserts with tiny screws that don't hold a heavy door. Very disappointing!"
40314640,"Old inserts were good- These are TERRIBLE. I sent my husband to the store to pick up 5 of these after an online order did not arrive when it was supposed to. I wish I had seen them first. Ikea totally cheaped out on these! They are flimsy cardboard, very cheaply made but sold at a price that commands better quality. I would not pay more than $12 for this product. Where the cardboard bends back to overlap (providing ""strength"" at the attachment point), the paper splits. The insert frame does not sit completely flush in the cube. The hardware doesn't sit perfectly in the bore AND the hinge is not adjustable, so you can't hang these so that the door closes flush either. You have to damage the Kallax unit to use any inserts now, so when you realize these are crap and remove them for return, you are left with holes and scrape marks. And just a heads up: prepare for the most annoying returns process anywhere. Cancelling an online order and returning what I already have here. This stuff is a headache."
20278167,Hard to install. Kallax inserts are hard to install without a drill or electric screw driver. They look great once installed.
60278170,"Poorly Designed. IKEA usually makes great products, but this is a rare miss.  There are no pre-drilled holes for the door hinges on the furniture, so you have to measure and mark the location yourself. Also, the opening for the screws to secure the hinges is oblong, so you can adjust the height slightly. This leaves significant room for error both vertically and horizontally. If the inner hinges aren't perfectly lined up with the piece attached to the door, the door will never lie flush. Also, the pressed board shelving unit doesn't hold the screws in place, so they can pop out easily.  I recommend skipping these doors and opting for bins. I can't speak for the drawers, but they probably suffer from the same lack of specificity."
60278170,"Took work to install.. While the doors are good, installing them was rough. The Kallax units do not have areas for the door hinge, so you have to make your own. This made things a bit difficult."
70286645,Hard to install with equipment listed. Kallax inserts are hard to install without a drill or electric screw driver. Looks great once installed.
30324507,"It's all right, but you have to install and handle with care. The door and the insert fit perfectly size-wise, however, the doors are hard to align perfectly. Additionally, the screws are so short that if you don't watch out you might pull the door out of its socket. Then, it's impossible to put it back."
00314642,NOT HAPPY - Must Put Holes in Your Unit to Use. These need to be screwed into your actual bookcase which will put holes in it. I think IKEA should make this clear in their description. I would not have bought these if I known they had to be screwed in. WHY did they change these to this cheap option.
19278253,"I have purchased several cubed. I have purchased several cubed products and this was so easy to put together! It is very sturdy, the accessories make this very unique and can be used multiple ways!! The plastic handle for the hex wrench saves the hand and makes it easier to put together! All the pieces go together without struggle...the holes line up for the screws where they belong, no adjusting. A great value for the price!!"
70301542,Excellent LP records storage. Minimalist and practical.
20278167,Good value and good quality. Assembling the Kallax is very simple and easy.  The instruction is clear and easy to follow.  I'd recommend buying it
19931865,"Nice bookshelf with optional storage. I have to admit I was inspired by a few of the desk setup videos on YouTube that featured this shelf and drawer combination. Aesthetically, the shelves and two drawers look very nice. In actual use I found the drawers themselves to be more shallow than expected and do not pull out as far as I would like. My IKEA store didn't have an example on the showroom floor so I bought without actually seeing it fully assembled in real life. I still like the overall functionality of the shelves and drawers but it's just the difference between expectations and reality."
20409936,"KALLAX shelf UNIT. Kallax Shelf Unit is suitable for any family home. We got 4*3 racks and everything is perfect. But I want to bring notice to the IKEA team, it needs more elaborate description for manual, which created some confusion while assembling.  "
19278253,Perfect album storage. This unit is the perfect storage option for record albums. My husband was able to organize his rather large collection and is so pleased with the result. Assembly was straight forward and the finished unit looks great and is very sturdy.
80334603,"Easy to assemble--but a bit tricky to finish. A great asset for storing larger items. But, be sure to follow instructions--when you get to that last piece. you'll be glad you did!"
60530577,"Follow directions carefully to avoid common problem.. I have bought several of these and it was very easy to assemble. If it didn’t slide together, I just used a mallet and it went together just fine. * I have seen several reviews that said they had trouble putting the last piece in place because the back panel was too long. I ran into this problem too and realized that it was because I hadn’t followed the directions correctly. It is easy to miss but the first side you start with is supposed to have a 1 on it. It is easy to miss! It is really important however, because the side with a 1 on it has a deeper groove so the back piece can slide down so you can slide the last piece in. I was able to slide the pieces apart so I could redo it and it worked just like it’s supposed."
40409935,"Looks great, but impossible to put together.. On some of my small square pieces, the pegs/dowels got stuck and broke before inserting another board. After IKEA sent two new boards and pegs when the unit was completed. The last screw kept turning and turning, it would not enter the final board. Now my kallax is in pieces and the dowels/pegs are of course stuck in the boards. It was quite difficult to build a 3x4 unit. It would be nice to pay extra and have it assembled at the store, but no taskrabbit for me, fore I live one hour away. The entire unit will be returned. I am very disappointed in the product."
69278335,Defective. Defective
29442677,A place for everything and everything in it's place!. I needed storage space for my clutter. I got the Kallax and added two drawer kits and four baskets. It is perfect. There is a place for everything and everything is in it's place. It was simple to build and I had zero problems.

50214678,. Easy to put together and looks just like picture. Nice
80275887,"Great design, easy to install, good look! . Good quality. Perfect/Average Size. Eazy installation if you play LEGO. Highly recommended. "
50481172,Cheap and affordable . Very light weight and nice utility stand. 
90495695,Good insert . Works great with kallax system
69336359,Very nice. I love it
00275848,Stronge. This storage is strong and can store a large amount of things.  It is well done.  easy to assemble.  This is my second order of this product
40275846,Kallax. I wish the storage boxes that go with kallax were in stock. I try every day and no luck.
20278167,Kallax Door. Easy to assemble and install. Hides the things I don’t want everyone to see.
70391038,"PERRRRRFECT size case!. Easy to put together, the perfect size for a small space AND tall enough to make it really efficient. Styling is good for traditional and modern. The bottom deeper depth is practical and provides extra stability too. So right."
60275812,Love it. Easy to ensamble. Good quality
80487813,Nice. Easy to ensamble
40409935,"Perfect for my space. The shelving unit is practical and decorative. It's also versatile, so you can adapt it to your needs easily."

60278170,"Awesome. Easy to install, looks nice and neat"
80487813,Shelf. Daughter even noticed how pretty my room looked with my new shelf.
90305803,Love this shelf unit. I use it as an ironing station so I can store iron related tools underneath on the two selves. Was a little changeling to put together but perfect height and size for the task
30275861,Great storage option. I do stained glass and this is perfect for storing all the different colors and tools I need to keep my shop organized
90495695,Doesn't fit. Bought two and they are too big!
40409935,Super easy to build. I have multiple of these and use them for board games.  
20278167,not happy!. the older version was so much nicer. Because you have to attach to the shelves leaves no option to change yourmind on configuration.
90495695,"DOES NOT FIT!. I'm so confused why you advertise this to fit in your cubes when they are clearly too big. Disappointed that now I have to DRIVE out of town to return this as there isn't an IKEA in my area and paid to have these delivered. My question, has anyone checked in with your quality control dept? Someone's been sleeping on the job!! Very deceiving IKEA!"
20275885,Good storage quality. Packaging is good. Wood quality is good and easy to assemble.
40324516,Kallax. Beautiful and works perfectly for my space
00275848,My Fave. Love Kallax storage units!! Easy to put together. Lots of options for storage boxes too!!
40501892,Kallax legs. Love it! I like my furnitures up off the floor so it’s easy to clean under it. Easy to assemble. Looks great.
20278167,Door Insert. Very well made and will be very useful for my sewing storage.
60324520,Shelf Unit. I love it because the colors match my life right now. It is chaotic and messy but it is slowly coming together just the way I like it.
80487813,so cute and easy to assemble. I had this on my wishlist for so long. Glad I finally decided to get it. Surprisingly nice!
90301555,"Arrived Damaged. Recently bought two of these shelve units for my new apartment and was disappointed to find that both of them had been dented in the exact same spot on one of the parts. Usually love Ikea furniture, but it looks like these must have been damaged at some point in the factory process which was a little disappointing. Still great just not brand new out of the box which makes me wonder if quality control has gone down recently."
20275885,Great for entertainment center. It's perfect for what we need. Holds all of our game systems and tv. The only issue we had is one of the wooden pegs broke well putting it together.
20275885,Great storage space for my bedroom lounge. Sturdy and looks elegant
20275814,Perfect. Just what I was looking for.. This fits perfectly with my other IKEA items.
80275887,Very nice. Very nice
80275887,Perfect for vinyl record collection. Kallax is perfect for my fathers record collection in his new music den/office.
40423719,"Very sturdy!. I do not have any Kallax shelving units, but I do have built in shelving in my scrapbook room and I bought these to use to sort all of my scrapbook paper. Easy to assemble, very sturdy and they look great in my scrapbook room!"
00275848,"Kallax bookcase. We are using this bookcase as a bench to sit on, in our foyer.  Delivery & Assembly was easy. It is sturdy enough to hold a good amount of weight. I have ordered a custom cushion to place on top of it, for comfort. I have purchased baskets & placed them in the 4 pockets underneath & am storing warm, house socks for my grandchildren to wear, when they visit us! Thank you, IKEA!🌺"
70286645,Nice looking drawers. I love it 
50454507,Great product for extra space . . Good quality at a great price. Very handy
20409936,Love this book shelf.. This book shelf is just what we needed to put out our children’s books for out granddaughter to access and read. The cubes are the perfect size and allow her to easily access the books.
20423720,"Easy to install, perfect for my needs.. I was able to assemble myself and install, very easy. Gave me the more options for my supplies."
20275814,Simple design and assembly. Love how lightweight it is too.
60278170,Great. The doors make this unit look classy.
20278167,"Kallax door insert. This insert would be so much better if it didn’t NEED to be secured to the shelf. I like to periodically reassess and revise my storage & decor, but having to drill holes limits that. I don’t like having to permanently deface a permanent fixture for something that make not work for me in six months. Otherwise, it’s a good product."
20278167,Kallax cupboard. Perfect to use in the kallax shelving system to create a closed door shelving. Looks fantastic. Easy to assemble.
00501889,Elevates kalax look. Sturdy base that elevates the look of the kalax system. We used small wood screws to attach it to the kalax. I would recommend this if you are looking at it. We are using this and the kalax with cabinet doors and drawers for an entryway console. We love the look and its functionality. Worth the money!
00275848,KALLAX Shelf Unit. Very well made and will very useful for my sewing storage.
00334536,Great to use. Pretty quick and easy to build and after installing wall hangers to hang.
90495695,Yarn Storage. Perfect for separating Kallax bins for yarn storage.
00324518,Easy to build!. This was one of the easiest pieces of IKEA furniture I've ever had to build. You do need two people! But my husband and I out this together in less than a half hour. I'm using it as a bedside shelf/table for extra storage in our small room. I do wish it had a few more screws in the center to stabilize it further but mostly it's just wooden pegs in the center parts. So it's not the most sturdy thing ever. I do wish they had a dark brown option but I may stain it.
20275814,KALLAX Cubicle Storage. Very well made and will be very useful for my sewing storage.
50481172,Hard to assemble. The screws were not set properly. It was hard to make use of the screw and connect joints. So it was shaky and felt flimsy.
30275861,Love My Kallax!!. Perfect for my Creative Memories Scrapbooks.
70301542,"Excellent and elegant. Excellent does bookshelves and storage , elegant and easily to assemble."
10409932,Great!. Great and easy to put together!
90286649,Got what I wanted and planned for.. Same as above
80275887,Amazing. I love my cabinets.. I am able to reorganize my l Closet to my liking
90286649,Replacement drawers. We had red and after we moved to a new house wanted black drawers. It was an inexpensive trade out.
89386107,Nice. These are nice. Easy enough for my husband to put together but it does take some strength. I probably would have had a hard time assembling them myself. Deducted 1 star because it doesn't come with any hardware to connect the two cabinets together as shown.
80275887,Storage is fantastic!. Storage is fantastic!
20275814,Easy to assemble and just. Easy to assemble and just what a needed for the space in my bedroom.
10305741,"Stack Up. Once it's all assembled, the shelf unit looks good and appears sturdy. However, assembly is somewhat tiresome and at the end more work than expected. When looking at the unit standing vertically, the horizontal shelves require hammering with a hammer and board to protect the thick side panels. The worse part is the last vertical divider has to be shaved between 1/32 and 1/16 of an inch in order to have the thick top panel lay flat across the side panels and not rock on the center divider. Once I figured this out, the final assembly was fine. I believe it is a result of the tolerance stack-up of the horizontal shelf thickness and overall height of the vertical members will always result in a dimension slightly larger than the side panel heights."
20275814,Sturdy. Love Kallax for craft room storage and display. Easy and quick to put together. Good price point. Great variety of sizes and uses.
60324520,"great product. I was looking for something substantial and attractive to hold my album collection, this is perfect."
40346924,Cube storage unit. Cube storage unit
80275887,Great shelf. Sturdy and easy to assemble.
20278167,"Versatile, but . . .. Kallax is versatile, and it has a clean aesthetic appeal, but it's far from robust, so we'll have to see how it wears. The doors and related cube enclosures are not easy to install using Ikea instructions, particularly getting the hinges to sit properly."
20275814,Better instructions for assembling. The instructions are difficult to follow because didn’t indicate what littler parts use and every single hole.
70286645,"Nice customization for the Kallax cubes. Love that the drawers slide very easily, and close with a light tap. Only improvement I would like is for drawer sides to be higher."
90286649,"Frustrating to put together but looks great. Oh man, for such a tiny item, it was very frustrating to put together. I'd rather put together 10 of the stands these go into than ever do this again. You will have to screw into the stand to get this to fit right. So make sure you are 100 percent sure where you want this to go. Once you have put this together it looks awesome and the drawers are perfect. I use mine as a make up drawer as I use my table as a get ready staging area. It works for what I need it to."
00314642,Good but..... It is geed and works well but it could hold more with a little change. The walls of the drawer itself could be taller making it ever more useful.
50324511,"Great add on. The concept of being able to add it later, for drawers is really great. Feel like the look of them isn’t as clean as some drawers look a little crooked."
80275887,"Nice Shelving Unit. I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this went together. Took my husband about 40 minutes to assemble one unit. No issues so far. Using it for my craft room and once things are organized, I think it will work well."
89386107,"EKET 4 cubby cabinet. Very nice quality. went together easily ( I followed instructions). My only wish is that the base with legs had been available- I would have liked that look, but the single wood legs I got do look good with the white cabinet"
90301555,"UGH!. The only IKEA is nearly forty minutes from me. I bought this item and decided to put it together today. What should’ve taken about ten minutes to assemble with minimal effort ended up taking nearly an hour and an unnecessary amount of work. All because the two side panels are reverse threaded on every side. When tightening the screws, the screws go perfectly into the top and bottom and repel the two inserts. It makes putting the two pieces together nearly impossible. Unfortunately I’m too busy working and gas is too expensive to return this item, especially since there’s no guarantee whichever piece I purchase won’t be the same or worse. Very inconvenient."
50481172,Good and reasonable price. Easy to install and lightweight
50481172,"Perfect for my pantry. Very sturdy. A little tricky to put together, so I suggest an extra pair of hands"
60275812,Album Shelves. I Love These Shelves
70301537,"Excellent all-pupose shelves. These shelves are deeper than normal bookshelves, so great for storing stuff. Easy to assemble. I added 2 drawer units and 2 cupboard doors - also easy. They look really nice."
10305802,"Nice Unit. Nice bookcase. I like that the top and bottom shelves are wood and only the center is glass - no need for me to worry about the cats if they decide to jump up on it. Fairly easy assembly once I found a video. This will probably end up in my home office. However, I took off a star because the wood shelves were not predrilled and it was extremely difficult to get the bottom shelf on. You will need a drill or electric screwdriver with drill bit to drill the holes for the screws."
50481172,"Toughest Ikea build I've ever done!. This review is for placing two pieces next to each other. I put together two Baggegos, then I took them apart, then I put them together again. I've put together five Hyllis and know that lightweight metal shelving can be very forgiving yet not at all forgiving. Adjusting two Baggegos next to each other for over an hour, they varied in angles that were half an inch off. which might've been ok for one piece, but when next to each other, no. I had to duct tape them together tightly to get them to properly align while adjusting. My knuckles were red from the mesh metal so I went in our toolbox to find a ratcheting phillips head screwdriver. You need a phillips with a fatter head and a skinnier handle, or better, a ratcheting handle. And you might need some duct tape or zip ties. One positive thing is that the screws are sturdy, the threads survived many adjustments. All that said, Baggebo is nice for us plant people because it lets light through the mesh surfaces, and it's fairly priced."
70301537,Poorly made. This is a very poorly made shelving unit. It’s held together with little wood pegs that make it very shaky. When trying to move it into a room without much room to maneuver I had to tip it up on it’s side a bit. That shift of weight broke all the wood pegs and collapsed the whole thing down on itself. So now I’m out the price of the unit and a trip to the dump.
90286649,Perfect. Just what we needed to give us the storage we needed.
00314642,Plastic was not white. I received this to put in my alternative kallax but I opened it up to find the rims of the shelf were covered with PE-LD 04 black labels that I could NOT get off. defeated the slim look. never got to put it together and now have to return it at the store. :(
40415601,Perfect Record Storage. For storing my record collection these are perfect
10275862,Great wall storage!. Great for my apartment with a very small closet. :)
00415599,Sturdy. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.
90495695,Perfect Sorter. They were a tight fit at times but work great to sort loose items. A perfect solution for craft or toy room.
60278170,Love the cabinet. Easy to assemble good quality
40311873,Good shelf just a little pricey. I've got these shelf in a couple of different configuration and this one is the smallest of them all. I needed the shelf for a small area and thats why I didn't get the bigger one. For the price I think this is a little expensive when you compare to the little larger one (2x2) for example. If you need the shelf for a specific space like I did and want to keep the style than you have no choice. Overall good quality that you would expect from Ikea
00388633,"Do not buy. I don't know why there are such great reviews. I opened the product and automatically wanted to return. First, all of the wood panels need extra coats of paint. I'm not sure how to say it correctly, but you can see the wood holes/marks which some might like, but there are blue streaks on every single panel. There are also dents and markings to a lot of the pieces. I would not recommend this product."
90324509,A wonderful item for storing games. I have watched many game reviewers as they sit in front of KALLAX units filled with games. I finally decided to try this out -- and I am so glad I did! This is the perfect game storage solution. I love these things.
00275848,"Time for BETTER directions an BETTER connecttions. I own MANY KALLAX units. My first large purchase 9 months ago was assembled by a friend. I recently assembled a second purchase myself.   I bought many items from IKEA back in the early 1990s, shortly after they opened in Philly. I now live in an IKEA-free zone. I can't believe that the hardware, during the intervening years, has become cheesier, and the assembly directions remain vague in every language. The reason for the first is obvious: profit. The second is unconscionable: laziness.   I had to reassemble this unit just as I was about to begin the unpleasant task of wall mounting it when I realized one side was in the opposite direction. The directions sheets LOOK as if they were printed in the 1990s as they are so faded. I had to look VERY carefully to comprehend my mistake -- FINALLY seeing two tiny dots on at the end of each panel that must align for mounting. Add an arrow noting they must align!!!  The wall mounting is another sad story."
10305741,"Kallax in glossy white. I picked up two 2 by 4 Kallax shelves. The first was a bit difficult to put together, but by modifying instructions became much easier. The second came with one of the short shelf pieces missing its gloss paint so that the shelf only goes along the wall until I paint over the raw edge. Both shelves gained small chips and indentations as they were put together, nothing major, but a bit of a bummer as they were brand new. If they were easier to put together and came in perfect condition, they’d be great. Still love the look of the white gloss and they will work for now."
80275887,Awesome piece of furniture!. Easy to assemble and sturdy. You can find multiple uses for this. Stand it up or lay on it’s side.
10221685,Crafter’s heaven. Great addition to the bookshelves. It hides lots of my paper crafting supplies which I put in little plastic bins and tuck inside the drawers. Keeps the space looking clean and organized.
20275885,"I can’t drill holes into my space. Apparently, these need to be permanently affixed via screws into plaster to be safe. NO THANKS AS THAT IS NOT A VIABLE OPTION!"
40324516,great product. I have bought several kallax shelving units over the years. Great quality control and easy to set up.
90286649,"Drawers for kallax cube. Easy to assemble, but drawers could be taller. Only 2.5 inches tall."
90495596,Does its job. Doesn’t exactly bolt on securely
20423720,disappointed. I thought these were great and just what I needed and bought several -- only to find that you can only use them on open kallax cubes. you cant use them on cubes where you have doors. So disappointing that Ikea limits you on how you can use them.
00324518,Shelving system for organizing. Bought two shelves and set up horizontally to use with bins that keep my space organized. Looks great across the wall!
30495599,"Elevates the Kallax units. I bought this separately from my Kallax unit because I wasn’t for sure I wanted to use them. But, I should have know how well they would be made coming from Ikea. I got the black for my light wood color Kallax unit. The color contrast is perfect and I can vacuum under it too. I am so happy with my Kallax. I bought 2 units and the feet and the Drona blue inserts. I get so many compliments on this in my scrapbook room. I highly recommend the feet for the perfect combination."
90495596,This base is a must have.. I did not want my Kallax unit to sit directly on the floor. This base brings it high enough to sweep under it.
40409935,"Perfect Storage. What else can you say about the perfect storage solution? I bought 2 sets and turned one vertical and one horizontal. I am happy that I bought the feet for them separately. I wanted to make sure I liked them first, so I bought the feet separately in case I wanted to take them back. I got the light brown color and the darker blue inserts. Best storage for my scrapbook room. The 12x12 paper fits perfectly!"
50481172,"Just right. Great price, right size, low profile makes the books the focus which is the best, holds more than you'd expect"
10409932,Kallax Bookshelf. Perfect shelf for my craft room. Now I want some drawers and doors to complete the look.
70339291,"Don't buy- you will regret!. We bought two, and 100% disappointed!! Don't buy unless you want to frustrate yourself out!!! We built the first one right after it arrived. Half way through, a major piece, the hole is miss punch! The second one arrived the next day. Until the last step, we noticed the metal part wasn't rectangle!! It was tilted!!  Now, we have two incomplete shelves standing side by side! They don't line up together on even surface!  WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK!!!!! PLEASE RECALL THIS!!! I just read the reviews, and many people have the same situation!! I wished I read the review before purchased this! Can't believe I even paid for shipping to get this over! PLEASE REFUND US!!!!! Ikea, I hope you are reading these reviews! I hope you can refund us and send someone to pick up the furniture! Thanks!"
70339291,"Piece in box was wrong - FRUSTRATED. I purchased this last week, deciphered the instruction book and got half way through and noticed that the large piece which is essentially the left frame didn't match the picture. It looked almost like the right side, but it wasn't a duplicate either. IKEA won't send a new piece, so I get to either hike back another hour and exchange or return. Poor product, poor customer service."
70339291,"Avoid Like the Plague!. Similar to many other reviews on the FJALLBO, I wish I never left the store with this shelf. Not only did it take a few hours to piece together but multiple parts were defective, including the main frame structure: holes drilled without threads, missing foot piece and no holes or screws to attach to a wall. It's safe to say this unit is a real piece of junk. Worst of all, after speaking with IKEA's USA help team (Twitter) they advised that I either disassemble it and bring it in for an exchange or try and fit the entire unit in my trunk so I can waste even more time dealing with this garbage and building a new one. Hmm, I wonder if the second one will have issues..."
70339291,"Why!. I was obsessed with this shelf, but it is HORRIBLE to put together !!!!!! Please do not buy it!!! The parts are all WRONG and it is fustrasting !!! I am so annoyed ! I have been working this shelf for the last 4hrs ! Easy to assemble but the part are off, and the screws are wrong. Warning do not buy!!!!! I love IKEA, but this was a bad choice!"
70286645,"Cheap material + damaged in box. I ordered two sets of these drawer inserts and they both arrived damaged! The sides of these inserts are a flexible cardboard material (instead of wood). They arrive flat and are designed to bend along seams in the 4 corners to form a box shape. Both arrived with a seam already ripped/detached, so I cannot assemble them without taping them back together. I am returning them!"
70286645,"Drawers don’t use space well.. I bought these for our playroom to help organize all the small toys. Bought these to put all the little figures and the side walls are HALF the size of the front. It’s a total waste of space and they hardly hold anything. Just put a basket in, don’t waste your money on these."
49285817,"Cute wall Cube. This cube is the perfect size and weight. It looks great on my wall. My biggest complaint is the assembly. I have bought several ikea items which usually don’t have the easiest directions. But this was Horrible. All 4 sides went on easy, but to get the back on took a mallet and lots of patience. I watched several YouTube videos to guide me , unfortunately, the assembly of 5 cubes took days. I had to walk away so my frustration did not lead to damaging the unit."
00388633,"Very attractive and functional. I like the furniture even better after I received a price adjustment since it went on sale right after we bought it. We added crown molding to the top of each bookcase, was just what they needed. Also added a shelf between the bookcases over the base cabinet, just tied everything together nicely. Love it!"
89442679,"Beautiful color. Kallax as always, quite utilitarian. But this color my new buy, looks stunning with the baskets shown. Also got other natural baskets/bins. My kitchen/dining has a farmhouse feel in my 1BR apartment. When fixing the smaller panel, doing alone with arthritic hands, had to use rubber/mallet lightly. Even for my fragile hands, left a cookie-crumble crack. They are quite flimsy. However, since this has underframe, I used the felt pads like a honeycomb design to cover the crack. It is best to take a helping hand. This being long top panel, thankfully I did not break the wood plugs. Ikea, pl provide some extra wood plugs for any Kallax . Thanks."
40324516,"I like this design. Sturdy looking, I like it. I wish there was more modularity options in height and width. Width is only available in 1 block, 2 or 4. Why not three?"
50481172,Useful.. Help to organizing.
40314640,"IKEA. It’s a big world, someone has to furnished it :)"
10409932,Perfect. I was looking for a good way to organize my caft papers and this unit is perfect! Love it!
50481172,Small space solution. Needed a small free standing shelf unit that could fit by the washing machine that someone in a wheelchair could use to keep cleaning supplies and detergent in reach to be able to do their own laundry and regain some independence after a near fatal motorcycle accident.
50481172,"Not so fast, not so easy. I agree with some of the previous buyers and wish I had seen them sooner. It was difficult to get my hand and screwdriver in the corners for the upper screws. The holes themselves are weird and it took me multiple times to get them in in general. I'm grateful I didn't buy two like I originally intended. I'm keeping it but won't be purchasing again."
50481172,Poor quality. I’m leaving an honest review. This product is very difficult to assemble. You need extremely small hands. The metal used is cheap and bends easily. Overall this is my least favorite ikea product. I do not recommend. It explains why it’s on sale.
50481172,"Nice quality but the shelves.... I love this show! It fits perfectly in the space, however, the screws to install the shelves are extremely difficult to reach based on their location and the small size of the screws. I had to finger tighten them for the most part because I could not get a screwdriver in the small shallow space."
99932540,no more clutter. This is so diverse and doesn't take up much floor space. I had some narrow space at the foot of my bed and this fit perfectly. The shelves and drawers are adjustable. My Yoga mat and wrapping paper fit in the drawer and hand weights and the modem in a wood box I bought from Target..I bought 3 of these and they fit perfectly on the bottom shelf: Wood Milk Crate Large by Pillowfort. I only put heavy things on the very bottom and light stuff above. You have to attach it to the wall or it could tip easily! Don't put heavy objects in the drawers.
50454507,office storage. This works well in my office space. I bought 2 and stacked them.
50454507,"Great Ravaror bookself. This item is neat and nicely crafted. It was easy to assemble, except for the holes marked for attaching the caster assembly. They had the punch mark, but lacked any pre-drilling, which made it impossible to get the screws to go into the product. Has to make starting pre-drilled holes enough to get the screw to attach properly.  I love the fact it is raised off the floor and easily moved when needed."
50454507,It looks great in my. It looks great in my house. I painted it to match my wall color.
99294517,Beautiful. This is a wonderful unit for having a workspace and a place to display product (or hobbies/collectibles).
99294517,"Wonderful piece of furniture.. I used it as a plant stand. I love it. It is very sturdy. Does not wobble anywhere. Easy to put together. I love IKEA furniture, I like putting them together and they last a long time. I have furniture over 12 years old that still look brand new."
40409935,"Love my shelves!. Easy to put together, used the customizer tool to figure out exactly what I wanted."
20409936,Great bookcase. This is a great bookcase. Very sturdy and looks great. It was easy to put together. There are some spots you need 2 people to get the shelves in tight. I got the stand to put it on and it upgrades the look.
50454507,"Decent rolling shelf. So far it is working out well, after just a couple of weeks. I wish the parts were better marked for constructing it."
80275887,Love the Kallaxes!. These past 2 I bought now bring the total number of Kallaxes owned to 6! They're so versatile and I love that they have different inserts to help with storage.
70483274,"Perfect bookshelves. Bought one to go on each side of our Besta TV stand for a media center. Look so perfect, modern and clean, and we’re surprisingly easy to put together."
60275812,"Storage cube. Easy to assemble, matches billy bookcase finish."
40311873,"Simple to assemble and does the job. It's a two cube kallax. Simple, easy to assemble, and does what it's intended to do."
40311873,"Mini cube. Easy to assemble, lots of drawer and basket options."
20213312,Vittsjo. I bought 4 . One was damaged!
20213312,Display Shelving. Awesome display shelving. Purchased to display my scale model collection. Love the glass shelving.
89398718,"Exactly what I wanted. I've been looking for a unit to fit under my dining room window for my plants and decor, this was perfect."
20213312,"You need to drill. Relatively easy to assemble. But the wooden shelves need drilling holes for screws, which takes extra work and effort. Otherwise, it’s a lovely airy shelf with its slim frame and glass shelving."
20213312,"Perfection. I waited MONTHS for Vittsjo to come back in stock, and I am so glad I didn't give up and purchase something elsewhere. To get a similar look elsewhere will cost ~$300. This shelf unit is GORGEOUS – modern, clean lines, simple, well-constructed, sturdy. I do wish the holes in the top and bottom wood slabs were pre-drilled, but it wasn't too difficult to do it ourselves. We also didn't receive enough padding stickers for the glass, so we improvised. I can't say enough good things about this unit otherwise."
40303439,"Sturdy and Beautiful. This does just what you want a display shelf to do. It's secure and sturdy, and blends into the background. I bought the smaller shelf in black a few years ago. I love the glass shelves so you can see through to items above and below."
20213312,"Look high-end. I have these shelves and they’re beautiful. They look high end and have a variety of uses. My one complaint is the stickers they used on them don’t come off very well so I have to use goo gone to get it off. Otherwise, beautiful shelves. Great value for the price."
00275848,Perfect for a Studio. I enjoy Kallax as it comes in so many sizes and heights. I use hit to organize my craft supplies. Thank you Ikea. Addition of the doors makes it a tidy look.
60275812,Old reliable. I just love KALLAX. Have had some for 20 years.
50481172,"Icing my Forearms. A great little 5 star shelf if someone else puts it together for you. I really wanted to believe the “so easy” reviews and not the “nothing can reach the screw holes” reviews. But alas. I also didn’t expect to spend 30 minutes removing the stickers. Then another 50 or 60 minutes to assemble, between everything sliding around, the 36 short little screws with nothing to grab onto to get them started, frequently dropping the screws and having to fish them out of the groove on the shelf, each screw taking all my weight and effort to coax it along every quarter turn, and all (16) of the top screws being about a millimeter away from the metal grate your knuckles will repeatedly scrape over in the process. I am a seasoned IKEA assembler and this one almost defeated me. I was sweating and hands shaking. I turned so hard the screwdriver bit got stuck in the handle. Agree with reviewer who said wait to tighten the screws at the end. Olive oil helps with the stickers. It’s cute."
00501889,"Floor base for Kallax. Nicely made, sturdy."
20275885,shelf. great item
70286645,Nice. I love the kallax unit and inserts. A little expensive for having to assemble yourself.
80275887,"Best cubby!. I absolutely love this shelf! I own quite a few, they are very sturdy and easy to build. I love how you can buy attachments to make it a cabinet as well."
10305741,Great piece. Easy to assemble but do take care not to chip the frame when hammering in the sides. Recommend using a rubber mallet instead of a hammer
40501892,Perfect. Gets the job done. Fabulous low cost.
00324518,Love it. Love it! Perfect for the space sturdy and nice color. Easy to put together 👍
89294532,"Great shelf! Recommend!. So happy with this shelving unit!  Hard to put together. be aware has a front and a back. instructions were not clear enough. Even so, just love this! Well worth the money!"
80275887,Excelente. Excelente
90301555,"Always a great deal. Kallax units are great storage units in all sizes! We use them in my sewing room, where I have the 5x5, 4x4 and 2x2 units, as well as our garage (where my husband customized some individual units). They are versatile and the doors and inserts allow us to tailor the Kallax to our specific needs."
10275862,Wonderful sturdy shelf organizer with flaws. I love how sturdy this piece is and that I can get organized now. It has very clear instructions to put it together. I have owned quite a few IKEA pieces of furniture like this one. The have all been great for a good price and well made. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the “faux wood” stuff that covers the compressed wood underneath. We always use a rubber mallet to hammer in the dowels and hammer the ends of the boards to get them to go in place. This unit had the “faux wood” stuff peeling up very easily and in multiple places. I have never had that happen…ever before. I can only assume that IKEA is using cheaper materials or something which is very disappointing and doesn’t make for the prettiest final product.
10324513,"Questionable Quality. Bought these to match one that I’ve had for 5 years. The quality has obviously lessened in the last few years, as these newer ones are more prone to cracking and flaking. Be very careful putting them together. Use soap to help the dowels go in - 80% of the holes were just enough too small that I needed a mallet to put the piece on. Not just a little tap with a hammer. And use a block of wood between the hammer and the shelf. Make the holes a tiny bit bigger!"
60278170,Dresses up your Kallax. These doors really improved the look of our Kallax. Took off 1 star cuz I had a little trouble getting the doors to fit perfectly straight.
09481684,"Love it!. I made this desk in 45 min. It was extremely easy to build with the instructions. Just make sure you don’t miss a step! And I was able to do it all by myself. Had it built before my husband got home 🤣 and I loved the packaging, it was minimal but efficient. So we didn’t have boxes for days!"
30275861,Storage Unit. Very sturdy and looks great in the room. I am using it for craft storage so I also purchased some of the drona inserts.
60275812,"Good for what we needed. Sturdy, easy to assemble, looks exactly as pictured."
30495599,Kallax. I love this so much! It takes the kallax off of the floor and elates its status from storage to furniture! The black gives it a modern vibe!
20275814,"Perfect for dorm room. We bought this to maximize storage in my daughter’s dorm room closet. The optional drawer and basket inserts made this perfect for her needs - some sections for folded clothes, some nicely holding smaller items in drawers. Thanks IKEA!"
90495695,"Great storage option for your Kallax shelf, tho a little fragile. I bought this along with other Kallax storage boxes as a place to keep rolls of paper and interfacing that I use for sewing. It looks great. It works great. My only issue is that I ordered it to be delivered and when it arrived (through the mail), one corner had been slightly dinged up. Not a huge deal since I was able to turn the messed up corner to the back and it's not really visible, but this needs better packing when being shipped. A great option if you can pick it up in store, but a little bit of a gamble if it's shipped to you."
90495695,Great item. I brought one several years ago in a Grey color. By the time I got back to IKEA you had discontinued them. I was excited to see them back. This time they are a thinner and only in white. How about a black/brown color to match my unit.
90495695,Kallax divide. This piece is designed to really fit the Kallax cubes. It won't shift or move once it's in the cubes. You do have to line it up exactly so that it will fit.
90495695,Good when they fit. Some of the dividers didn't fit into the cubes. It seemed like they were just a tad too big. And the cubes we have are this brand from IKEA.
90495695,"Nice, but need darker color. I have a black-brown Kallax, and would have liked this insert to match. Since only white was available, I bought it and spray painted it black. It was a little more difficult to fit with the thickness of the paint, but works overall."
60275812,"Shelf unit, black-brown, 30 3/8x30 3/8 "". I did not purchase this!!!"
19931865,"Wonderful piece. I've had this shelving unit in two going on three apartments now. I've used it as an open dresser for clothes in my bedroom, and soon it will be a TV stand in a living room. The clean lines of the design blend in and brighten any room. Even though the drawer mechanism requires a little patience to build, they close cleanly in keeping with this price point or a higher one. I would definitely recommend it. I'm grateful it's so easy to switch out the shelf configuration. As someone mentioned in another review, it's very important to anchor this unit because it's quite tall. Even though it's sturdy you want to make sure to have insurance against weight being distributed in the wrong way. Overall a great-looking, functional piece that would cost much much more if CB2 or West Elm had come up with it."
10305741,"Works perfectly!. We bought this shelf to display and hold a collection that we have, and it works perfectly!"
80275887,Kallax cube units are awesome. I am redoing my craftroom with Kallax cubes and I absolutely love the look and the quality of them. We have had zero problems assembling the units and actually enjoyed them coming to life and taking their place in my room. I am far from being finished but it is coming along beautifully. Thank you IKEA. I do wish you were closer to us.
40275846,"KALLAX. If you are in need of shelving units, Kallax might just fill the bill! It is easy to assemble and can be used to add to your other Kallaz shelving units!"
00324518,Nice Shelf. Nice shelf
10324513,Nice large shelf. Nice large shelf
80487813,Kitchen storage. Absolutely wonderful addition to my small kitchen space! It is attractive and is useful for storage.
20409936,Love it!!. Fits cubes that are 13 x 13 and works wonderfully. Love this product!
20423720,"Perfect fit. Fits perfectly, options to customize are great"
00275848,Perfect. Good fit
70286645,Perfect. Excellent
00324518,It does what I needed it to do.. It does what I needed it to do.
10409932,"Love it. Easy to put together, I built it alone. Solid piece, well built. My teenage daughter loves it."
70339291,"Received Defective unit. One of the protruding brackets that lines up for the rectangular pipe that holds the wooden shelf are soldered on tilted at an angle, so that means I cannot align the rectangular pipe to properly hold the shelf. Still attempting to contact customer service, and ikea has probably the worst customer service I have encountered, not looking forward to this. Lazy quality control."
10345073,"Great basket. It clips in and locks tight. I use an old expedit wall unit as a headboard, and this basket just made it that much more wonderful. My 15” MacBook Pro fits in quite nicely in it so I have room to put a glass of water and my phone and pills without worrying about any spills. It really increases the amount of space I have reachable from bed, since nothing I keep nearby is tall enough to take up the whole height of a cubby."
10345073,Love This Option!. The baskets for the KALLAX system are fantastic! I use one of my KALLAX to store purses and the basket works to store wallets and clutches with the purses. This accessory makes the cubes so much more functional and they’re already functional! Love this!
10345073,"Must have baskets for cube storage. These baskets are PERFECT for dividing items in cube storage. The genius design of a clip at the back of the basket, around the shelf, makes it stay in place and not sag, while allowing the use of economical, lightweight material."
80275887,"Kallax bookcase. Great shelf... nothing fancy, but made well and looks nice. I look forward to filling all the little squares! Also your delivery was great!!"
80401292,"Excellent Product. I love this for small storage containers. It’s very well made, such a great option to add to my Kallax unit."
50481172,Value for the money. Easy to assemble and too sturdy. Looks neat and simple
50305739,Looks Good!. Looks Good!
40501892,Lightens visual weight. The Kallax legs are perfect to add just a little height and getting it off the floor makes it seem not so heavy visually
40501892,"Unfortunately, the unit is a. Unfortunately, the unit is a little wider (about 4 inches) than my Kallax, however I plan to keep it and drill my own holes so the unit can sit more securely. Despite the size difference, I love the way it looks."
40501892,"Genius solution to a problem I didn’t know I had.. The Kallax stand is a wonderful solution to uplifting and upgrading the Kallax line of shelving. In my case, it lifted my horizontal, four bin unit to a more appropriate TV stand."
40501892,Excellent option.. The Kallax is great and this option makes it even more versatile. I had a spot with floor vents and I wanted a 4x1 Kallax shelf to go there. It fit perfectly and the legs made it so it didn't block the vents.
40501892,"Doesn't fit. Obviously I purchased this to get my Kallax up off the floor only to find out that this is longer and wider than my Kallax. My Kallax fits right down between the legs. I have the 8 cube Kallax and looking at the website it shows an 8 cube one sitting on the base. The joke is on me - the base is 58"" and my Kallax is only 51 3/4. I just assumed that the Kallax all had the same size base since it shows the 8 cube sitting on it. With the price of gas, I don't think it is wise to drive 2 hours to return a $20 item. Maybe I can repurpose it?"
40501892,FINALLY!. This is a long overdue addition to the beloved Kallax series. I was able to put a kallax unit against the wall OVER a floor heating vent. It looks fantastic as a sideboard in my dining room.
40501892,"Simple, nice stand. The shelf has small knobs attached to it, provided in the stand kit, and simply sits upon the stand. The small knobs keep the shelf from shifting on the stand."
00501889,This base should be available. This base should be available for ALL Sizes of Kallax storage products.
80275887,Floating tv stand. My husband and I used this to create a floating tv stand by connecting two Kallax to get the desired length. We’re happy with the finished project
80401292,Perfect. Works perfectly for my sewing room.
30275861,"Nice Architectural Piece. This unit is amazing for a small apartment and was actually easy to assemble if you do so on the floor and watch the video. I finished it on my own, and I am 68 years old female albeit a little handy! What is really nice about it is that it is simple and showcases books and objects wonderfully! Make sure to attach to wall; I used a non-wall damaging product from Amazon."
70538846,"Perfect low height bookshelf. We had been on the lookout for some bookshelves that would fit below our windows. These were the exact perfect height. We bought two to spam the 8ft windows. Construction is very solid and sturdy, which is expected considering the price. I really like the look of how the meta grabs the shelf. Easy to assemble and took less than 30 mins for each unit. Would buy again"
50305739,Awesome cube storage. Perfect for my library and activity center.
50481172,"Good choice. Easy to assemble, Perfect for the space and my needs."
30275861,"Great Shelving. We use these for lots of applications, the latest to organize T-Shirts and clothing instead of using a dresser."
80275887,Perfect!. Fits all of my vintage record albums.
10305741,Perfect. This was exactly what I was looking for. Looks great!
90324509,25 kallax cubes. Love these for my craft supplies. Will keep my craft area very organized.
20275814,Great product. I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It was easy to assemble and looks great.
70301542,"Sturdy. Sleek design, sturdy structure, lots of storage"
10409932,"Great basic shelf unit. Easy to put together, functional and clean looking"
00275848,"Nice piece for organizing. Good quality furniture. If I could give everyone one tip it would be to set up a large table and build the furniture on it, saves on your back and you have more leverage to tighten the screws."
70538846,"Well made, well designed. Excellent quality shelf. Really nice look with bamboo shelves and easy to assemble. This looks great in our living room."
49275088,"Great Bookshelf. We had been looking for a slightly taller bookshelf to replace our 3 shelf Billy but that wasn't as tall as the 79 version and saw this in the showroom. The color is wonderful and the fact that it is made out of hardwood was such a nice surprise for the price. My only complaint (and it's barely a complaint) is that the middle shelf cannot be adjusted, though I understand why (to help with the stability of the shelf itself). Normally, I don't have any issue with IKEA instructions during assembly but I did have some difficulty figuring out which pieces were which a few times as they're not clear on the instruction pages but once I figured it out, assembly was quick. It looks great and we are planning to buy the matching coffee table and tv stand. :)"
80428852,great storage solution. great storage solution
79197584,"Love this. Not our first Kallax. We have 9. Great as room dividers, display, books and storage! Super easy to assemble."
90305803,"Love it. Easy to set up, and has a modern look to it. Would recommend!"
30275861,"Nice and Sturdy!. It is visually appealing, and it holds and organizes everything that I need it to."
80275887,Perfect for many uses. I’m a crafter and used 2 of these for my craft table. Works and looks amazing!
00275848,Love ikea products. 100 percent happy
20275814,Kallax shelf unit. love this product and the customer service
89386107,"Not Easy to Assemble. I like the look of this shelving unit, however the assembly process was difficult. The shelving unit isn’t assembled by screws, you have to line them up and it’s a slide-and-lock process. This was challenging and created some scuffs. Just a warning, it’s challenging! I haven’t bought IKEA furniture before, so this was my first experience and I’m a little disappointed in this product."
89386107,Rip off. This comes in two shelves without a way to attach them that doesn’t cost you extra money you have to put out. It would’ve been cheaper just to buy two of the shelves and put them together
89386107,WORD OF WARNING. I bought this in combination with the EKET Glass doors no. 304.289.01 and the glass doors fell short dimensionally. I miss the days when you could buy Kallax cabinets with glass doors that fit just like their solid cubby doors. (((sigh)))
89386107,"Would Not Recommend. This piece is not as easy to put together as some reviews say. Nowhere in the instructions does it say a rubber mallet (or similar) is needed to make sure the pieces fit snugly together.  One review also said the pieces are numbered—no they are not. So I had to take apart one whole shelf because on the last piece the holes and knobs were not the same distance apart and would not fit together.  I was under the impression that some hardware would come with this combination to interlock the 2 shelves together. That's not the case. Also, there are no pilot holes drilled into the bottom of the shelves so I have to figure out how to do that myself.  It would've been cheaper to buy all the pieces separately, and that would've been a better representation of what you're getting yourself into. I'd give it 1 star, but once you wrestle everything together it looks alright."
89386107,"Terrible. Probably the worst product in IKEA. It is supposed to be easy to install but it's exactly the opposite. This ""hook"" system is absolutely terrible. I will NOT recommend this product. It looks ""innocent"" but it's a disater !"
90286649,Kallax products are great!. I love this product!
40423719,"Works fine but there is room for improvement. 1. I really want to see other color options, matching all colors available for Kallax cubes. 2. I'd also love to see more configurations, because 1 shelf is too generous, and 3 shelves are too tight for my needs (sheet music). May be, pre-drilled inserts with additional shelves sold separately to allow configurations of 1, 2, 3, or 4 shelves at customer discretion. 3. It would be nice if these inserts were compatible with door inserts. And it is definitely overpriced in my opinion."
20278167,"Great addition to shelving unit. These drawer and door insets for the shelving unit are visually appealing, easy to assemble and make organizing real easy."
80401292,"Not sure how I feel. I thought I had these pieces push all the way in when putting this together so when I out it in my brand new kallax cube, it scratch the white up inside. So disappointing. There should be better instructions. I even used the padding on the edges that came with it but it still scratched the pain and now my shelve has scratch marks on it. I like the divider but not what it did to my new cubes"
40501892,Give just the right amount of lift. Raises my Kallax of of the floor and gives it a more polish look.
10305802,"size, Price & Quality 3 shelving unit. i'm over a 65 year old female, assembly was easy. Impt to lay it all out first, so i can visualize pieces with pictures! I put it together myself, excellent quality, at an excellent price! Looked all over town, for an item like this and could not find it anywhere BUT Ikea."
30324507,"good product. Nice color, good instructions and easy install, good quality."
20423720,Great way to expand your storage. Love the cleverness of the inserts. This was a piece of cake to install and now I have 2 usable spaces!
80275887,Great unit. Our daughter loves this unit in her room. She is using it store books and other items. Very happy with our purchase
09189200,Annoying. You couldnt make one that was as tall as kallax on it side
60275812,Kallax.. Worked out perfectly for our needs. We needed 2 and they are quite functional
00275848,"Made wonderful entry hallway. Easy to build and then fit 3 together to make the 'U' shap. Put a backing covering all three pieces and do. We'll, except for trim and paint."
60275812,Better Storage In Just Five Minutes. This is - by far - one of the easiest pieces of furniture to assemble you can purchase from IKEA. It will take about five minutes to assemble and give you a ton of options for storing things. Great for organizing any size space. Empty cubbies especially get a seal of approval from my cat.
89442679,Love it!. There's too many black shelving units in my place so I thought I'd go for a brighter unit. So glad I did! I love this for my media/turntable/vinyl/cds/art books collection. I hope thet make a dvd shelf unit.  Also easy to put together.
80334603,"Terrible Assembly Instructions!. I just finished assembling eight cubes. The cubes look great in our home office, but the assembly instructions are some of the worst I have ever encountered, and I am a technical writer. It took an hour to assemble the first cube. I had to take it apart once and that was no easy task. Once I figured it out, the remaining seven cubes only took 5 minutes each to assemble. The assembly video makes it look so easy, and it would have been with better instructions. It shows a woman snapping the sides together and then pushing them flush with her hands. Impossible. I used a rubber mallet. My husband couldn't even push them flush with his bare hands. Also, there were several plastic parts included with the cubes, but I couldn't figure out what they were for or how to even install them. I looked for info on the IKEA website but could not find anything. I'm using the cubes without the plasticware, and they seem to be just fine."
59442713,"Misleading Looks. The product page pictures doesn't follow the directions to the underframe manual. If you follow the directions of the manual, it requires to flip the shelf on its side to install the underframe. One side of the shelf is unpainted and it gets exposed when it's flipped. Also, when the shelf is flipped sideways the little wooden dowels is going to be the main supports to hold items in each slot instead of the solid boards for each layer. The shelf is fine by itself, but addition of the underframe feels like an afterthought by the designer."
00324518,Best supporting theme. The item fully supports the theme my daughter is creating and allows her creativity to flow.
00501889,Raised base for Kallax works great. Adding the raised base to the Kallax units makes them look more like a piece of furniture than a box. It also assists in accessing electric outlets that are located behind the unit. It prevented blocking one of the air vents for the heating system too. The connection system is slick and very easy to do. Two suggestions: if youa re putting the shelf in front of an electric outlet place a power strip in it before attaching to the wall and tuck it under the shelf. And you really need to fasten the shelves to the wall when using the raised base or it will not be stable.
80275887,"Great Storage Piece. I use these in closets to organize clothes, shoes and household items. Keeps everything neat!"
80275887,"Superior to Other Cube Shelves. I have many Kallax, and two or three non-kallax cube units.   Kallax are superior, by far. They are more durable and more substantial."
90301555,Cube storage. Was easy to put together. My only issue is that you can see the screws on top where it’s put together.
80275887,"As expected.. The Kalyan cube is sturdy and works for storing fabric in my quilt room. It was easy to assemble even for me, a 71 year old female. My daughter had to help me lift it onto a credenza as it was too heavy for me to lift by myself. I have the cube running sideways not standing tall. I am extremely pleased with this purchase."
20305745,Get it!. I love this system! It looks great as a wall divider or just a display. Very versatile!
30275861,"Perfect piece. This had easy to explain directions, was easy to put together, and it helps me keep organized."
30275861,"Update to Questionable Quality review. Ok this big daddy does not want to work out for me. The holes aren’t deep enough for the dowels and can’t be drilled deeper. I’ve had to cut all the dowels down 1/4” inch which is completely absurd. The smaller 8 cube came together easily, but not this 16 cube. I’m literally traumatized. So quality is not questionable anymore but clearly lacking!"
30275861,"Great choice for us. We bought the Four high by five across Kallax and 2 two by five Kallaxs for our needs. The small ones can be put together by one person but do need two people to lift on to the base (which we chose to purchase for one of the 4x5 Kallax). The larger Kallax does require two people to put together and to put up on its base (we chose to purchase the base). The second 2x5 Kallax was put on top of the 4x5. Because we have baseboard trim, everything was anchored to the walls. It was great that the wall anchors were included."
40415601,"A good case for our records. Pretty sturdy and easy to assemble. I wish they would come in other wood colors, though."
10305741,Love this. Easy to assemble by my self. Great for organization.
20275814,Kallax. Took me a little longer to put it together but it turned out great.
69481681,So beautiful and stores so. So beautiful and stores so much!
50481172,"The reason I bought this shelve is because of the size fit my closet. Not kidding, I spent about than 50 minutes of my life to assemble this simple shelve, don't mention 38 screws, the screw holes are in the corner, and difficult to put them in, with hand screw only"
80275887,Kallax bookshelves. We repurpose this as a stand for my turntable and way too many vinyl albums that fit the job perfectly
70286645,Kallax drawers add space. These drawers are the bomb! They are great for storing the smaller things we need and keeps them organized!
80275887,storage unit. great product hate the prices keep going up on them for the same product
10305741,"excellent addition. I purchased 3 Kallax during the anniversary sale, they look great for storing my books and nik-naks . Unfortunately when assembling the one Kallax I must have forced the joint and the shelf literally exploded. I need to contact service to see if I can obtain a shelf."
20409936,". I thought this would be harder to build than it was. My tip on this piece is to have a helper or something to push against when you screw in the main screws. Then do not add the last shelves till you do the other wall with the double screw holes, then flip, add the last two shelves and the last other piece. I love this piece so much I am considering to get two more to place on both sides of the fire place."
00275848,"Surprising use…. We purchased this for my daughter’s dorm room… as a bedside table next to bunk beds! The top of the unit and upper shelf function as a perfect nightstand for the top bunk and the shelves below for the bottom bunk. (we thought this was ingenious!) This unit is sturdy, looks great, and is simple to assemble."
20423720,"Great, but incosistent fit. I installed three of these units into my shelf, two vertical and one horizontal. One of them seemed to barely squeeze in and I'm not sure why!"
10409932,"Versatile Storage. I love Kallax cube storage! It is sturdy, holds anything and everything, easy to assemble. I just keep finding new uses for them."
20423720,A little flimsy. A little flimsy
20423720,"Pick up in store, don't have it shipped. Bought about 10 of these in the store and totally fell in love. Ordered another 6 online and all 6 showed up with busted corners. I'm waiting to exchange these at my local Ikea location but my local store never has these in stock."
10409932,Kallax 3 x 4. Nice storage unit. Love the additional accessories available to enhance storage abilities. Recommend going to store to purchase due to long wait for truck delivery.
49306872,Very Unhappy. It took 3 of us to put this together. It is not complete but using any way. The directions were not good at all!
10409932,Overpriced. Overpriced
90301555,"Cute, Sturdy, Easy to assemble. Very versatile piece. Well made and easy to put together. I also love that there are doors, drawers, wine rack to put inside the cubes."
20409936,There are no half shelves. There are no half shelves that come in the color I purchased kallax in. Only comes in white. I wouldn't have bought it if I knew in was limited on add ons to white only.   Shelf itself is nice. But comes with no insert options in other colors.
20409936,would love this size in the glossy gray or true black. One star because of limited color options.   My wife & I bought & love the glossy gray 2x4 version (bought used over a year ago because it's always out-of-stock whenever we try to buy it - even today) but we use it for a growing vinyl collection that will eventually need more shelving. We would highly prefer the glossy gray or at least true black to better match our existing color scheming. A little bit can go a long way. . . .
10305741,Kallax. These were easy to put together and perfect for my craft room.
10305741,Sturdy bookcase. Safe place for books and notebooks collection.
10305741,High gloss storage unit. I love that it was so easy to put together and looks so nice. I gave only 4 stars because it chips very easy from high gloss finish.
89435221,It’s okay. Product was difficult to put together of course the instructions is strictly pictures so I had to YouTube had to assemble the rails to hang on the wall did not come with screws so the screws I did buy didn’t hold up
70301542,Awesome shelving for vinyl records. Perfect for my record collection
10305741,Very nice and easy to clean!. I will buy more of these.
40314640,Nice look to Kallax system!. This adds a different look and you can use to file or store items more discreet. Very easy to assemble and clean look.
70286645,Nice drawers. I love the drawers. They were easy to put together. They fit well in the cube and work nicely.
40303439,"Perfect for my plants!. I waited until this particular shelf was available to be delivered to my area. I’m so glad I did. I wanted it for my plants, and it’s perfect for the growlights to stick on the top and shine through the glass to the next shelf. I love it."
60221683,Good storage. Fits well in space with shallow depths
20275814,Love it. Bought to store vinyl records as well as a music stand. It is the perfect size for it. The only thing is that the metal of the screws are visible not very aesthetically pleasing. It was easy to assemble and is sturdy.
90495596,easy to put together. this was so easy to put together and help to elevate my Kallax shelves
20275814,easy to build. These shelves look great and were very easy to put together!
10487816,"Favorite Piece of Furniture from IKEA!. I wanted the Ekenabben BADLY when I saw it in the showroom. Unfortunately, it was out of stock at my store but I signed up for text alerts to find out when it would be available for purchase. It was worth the wait! I bought two for my office -- sturdy, sleek, non-descript shelving perfect for books, boxes, and knick knacks. I was able to put it together in less than 20 minutes. Love it!"
10487816,"Just the right size!. This little shelf is so handy and absolutely adorable. I am using it as a microwave stand, and to hold my cookbooks and it fits in just right. I imagine this would be perfect for so many rooms, I just love it, and building it was a breeze."
10487816,Love this product. Bought this and use it to store all my non daily use appliances like a crock pot it’s exactly as the description and steady. Also very easy to put together
10487816,Handy little shelf. One nice extra touch that you might not notice on the picture is that it has leveling feet.  I’m using mine as a plant shelf - the metal shelves are nice because they do get a little wet when I mist my plants.
60275812,"Cost reduced Expedit... misleading presentation. I have this 4-cubby piece in EXPEDIT, bought a few years ago. It worked really nicely as a warm, textured catch-all in our open entrance. So when we needed to extend the storage space, I did not think twice about buying another one. Not remembering the original name, I saw this and bought it in the black-brown color. It is not the same -- not even a bit. The chunky edges are no more, the warm dark wood is similarly named (black-brown), but now it's a wood-textured black -- no brown detectable. What was mis-leading was that in the store, they still showed an Expedit piece, warm brown color which turns out does not exist in Kallas. So I brought home the boxes... What a mistake... The piece measurements are the same on paper, but the actual measurements are smaller. Whereas the original Expedit had personality and warmth, this could well live in a conference room and nobody would bat an eye. Not quite 1 star, because the functions are ok -- I do like the drawers, even if they have shallow sides (1/2 of the door heights) and flimsy hardware (plastic tightening screws, and nuts). I would definitely have bought a different color had I realized this was different. Now where can I find an Expedit cubby?"
70286645,"Bring back the old. I do not like this new insert at all. Bring back the old version that could be pulled out and relocated as modular furniture should allow. And worst of all, I didn't realize that the product had changed until I bought several and got them home... an hour away across an international border..."
10487816,"Love it, waiting for 5. Love it, waiting for 5 shelf unit to get in stock to complete."
40275846,Great variety of features. Looks great and is perfect place for area!
10275862,Great addition to my crafts room. Nice way to store all my different materials and books.
60324520,Kallax. Good quality. Easy to put together.
70339291,durable. very functional product and sleek
70339291,"Sturdy, attractive bookcase. The bookcase is exactly what we were looking for! The assembly was kind of challenging for us, but for an experienced IKEA assembler it would probably be simple. It was worth it in the end for sure."
00415599,Great option for a small space. Great storage option! Although when the product arrived there was some damage. Arranged it to hide this.
80401292,Love this item. I absolutely love everything I buy at Ikea. I am putting this in my Kallax shelf unit in my office
80401292,"Small items organizer. While this may be used for wine, we opted to use this for my daughter’s dance clothes. It’s perfect so that each outfit (leotard plus matching tights or leggings) is in each of the cubbies. This way she can easily get her dance bag prepared herself."
49442676,"Kitchen island!!. I put two of these kallax cubes together to create a kitchen island. One side for kitchen storage and one side for other storage. Put a butcher block counter on top and it looks great. Roomy, sturdy and attractive."
60278170,"Poor quality and wrong dimensions. Dimensions are listed at 13 inches wide and 13 inches tall, but is actually 13 1/4 inches wide and 13 3/16 inches tall. The slight increase in size means it won't fit in my shelving."
20278167,Too hard to install. Don’t bother with these. Just use the cubes
10305741,Storage. I got this product with an amazing online deal. I have been wanting to get this for a while for my craft room and I love it.
80275887,"So much room!. I love how much this shelf holds in my classroom. I am using it in my classroom library, and I can easily fit large baskets of books in each square. It is sturdy - a necessity in a first grade classroom! It helps that I found it at a discount in the as is section."
30495599,Simply the Best. Marta helped us get to know Kallax brand. They are versatile and for all ages who need space and organization. It looks Fabulous and we would like another set.
20473593,"Just right. Good looks, functional…what’s not to like?"
20275814,play room. Loved this for my grandchildren's playroom! So sturdy and loved the baskets too!
80334603,"Versatile. Solid, low profile with ability to configure (hack) in many, many ways. Multiple colors"
60278170,Nice Quality. I have several and need a couple more. I've had the originals for several years. Still in good condition.
70286645,Great Drawers!. These drawers are easy to install and look amazing!
70286645,Great article draws!. These draws work perfectly with the Kallax system. They make it more organized for small items and give it a nice look. I recommend them!
40275846,Great shelf!. I use this shelf in my classroom. I have bought others in the past and I have been pleased with the durability.
80275887,Amazing furniture. This great piece eliminated a whole of bulky 1970s furniture
79442694,Strong and Pretty. Goes together easily. Tons of storage space and the stand allows for it to be placed over a floor heater vent with room for a deflector. Game changer for me. Not too tall. A shame these never go on sale anymore!!
59902658,"Great shelves!. The website picture is a little misleading, I thought I was getting a triple unit not a double and a single. But either way, I’m happy with my shelves, they’re definitely more sturdy than my old plant shelves, and more aesthetically pleasing!"
70301537,"Quality decrease. Over the years, I’ve bought many units of these cubbies shelves. But this time, I had trouble assembling the unit, missing pins, misaligned holes. I was able to assemble it but it took longer and it doesn’t feel as sturdy as it was in the past."
70286645,Love these!!!. It gives the whole unit a smooth clean look
70538846,Love it!. I am really happy with this purchase. It was a good price and perfect for my needs.
89221055,"The doors are awful. The doors on these pieces are awful. They are impossible to align properly. I highly recommend avoiding the EKET with doors, just go with open shelves."
80401292,Not just for wine!. I actually used this in my craft room. I found some slimline clear storage bins that fit perfectly in each section. Love the versatility of their products!
80483283,"Sturdy and stylish. Simple to put together. Very Sturdy. Very stylish. Holds so many books, albums, Knick-knacks. Will buy again."
19278253,"Sturdy and attractive. I needed a bookshelf for all my homeschooling supplies. I chose this one mostly because the shelves are deep enough that binders don't hang off the edge like with most bookshelves. I also love that it is versatile and will look great on my dining room once we're done homeschooling! I've put together a lot of IKEA furniture so I thought the assembly was easy (bought it, drove 40 minutes home, and assembled in a single evening)"
70301542,"Love this! All is hidden. I do a lot of arts and crafts and this helped me organize all my materials. Also, looks beautiful in my living room and no one can see what is inside. No mess, no mess!!!!! ❤️"
10305741,Function and look. Not that difficult to put together. High sheen looks perfect I’m office. I bought 2. One is utilized for bookcase other is utilized for printer and desk accessories. Love this product.
00275848,Perfect storage cubes!. Super easy to assemble and great quality for the price! Looks adorable on its side with wicker storage baskets and throw pillows on top.
90286649,"Simple functional drawers. The drawers fit perfectly into the Kallax and work smoothly. Screwing the screws into the Kallax sides was a bit challenging, but nothing a little perseverance couldn't handle!"
70301542,Very sturdy and functional. Completely filled the need I had. I was very satisfied with quality and ease of asssembly.
20278167,"Great quality. My first IKEA purchase. I am 71 years old, and my 75 year old husband was astounded that I could assemble it with minimal assistance.  It adds convenient storage to my kitchen/dining area and fits in nicely with my previous furnishings, although they are vintage."
20278167,I LOVE THIS. I Purchased this item for a sewing table I am making and this insert is a blessing. Purchase this item and you will not regret it. It truly is the best discrete space saver I have found.
00501889,"Kallax: Great Product!. The Kallax bookshelves/cubie assembled easily, looks great and are very functional."
30275861,Office divider. Easy to build look good
39932538,Exactly What I wanted!. This shelf unit with drawers was easy to assemble and looks great. I love that the unit is metal and could be screwed to the wall. The drawers open well with one hand and are quiet open and close.
70301542,Love them. I’ve had these in every house I have owned and I love them. Keep me organized
39932538,"Perfect for my purpose. I am re-doing my doll room, replacing typical home hardware type plastic shelving. The low-profile, yet solid sturdy components are ideal for displaying my collection. The drawer units are perfect for storage of accessories and clothing, keeping them dust-free, and also keeping the display off the floor."
70301542,"Kallax stoage cubby. Excellent product, perfect for multi-storage items and very sturdy"
20423720,Great space saver and divider. Pro: Adds mor space to kallax shelves   Con is price that the pieces are flimsy than sturdy
20415193,"Mostly good but quality/quality control is lacking. I have purchased five in total (two grey, three brown). In two shelves I have had warped boards that caused issues with putting it together securely or unstable shelves. There is no warranty, so beware. You need to report a complaint within 48 hours so don't miss this window. They are good shelves but you may have to purchase more than you planned."
70483274,Storage Shelves. Very easy to assemble and met my needs.
90301555,Easy to assemble-looks great. Easy to assemble and it looks great. Looking forward to using it in our bedroom as night stands with storage!
80275887,"great economical book storage. I love this product as it is very versatile. I have several standing up boardering french doors that house dvds and 2 laying on side creating long low bookcases on either side of a king bed. The ample top surface is perfect for device charging, purse, magazines etc. I have another on its side in a playroom my grandchildren use and it houses, books, puzzles, games, and craft supplies. Thanks again for a great product that serves many purposes."
20301554,Good quality!. Looks great definitely! It’s a good choice for a kids room
80275887,Perfect. I love it.
70538846,"Beautiful and the perfect size. It fits our needs very well, assembling was fairly straightforward, and it looks great in our space"
50483289,"Perfect accompanying piece. To add variety to the office, we bought this and the taller VIHALS shelving. We love this sleek, simple design. It hold so much and looks so good. It’s sturdy and solid as well."
60324520,Love Product. This made my life so much better and organied. I bought the larger 4x2 and going back tomorrow and get the 4x3.
50324511,Overall Great Product. Was easy to build and the drawer and door components were an easy addition.
90301555,Easy to put together. The storage unit was perfect and looks like it does and was very easy to put together. I like that it is sturdy but not heavy. I had a birthday coupon so the price was great.
40275846,Love for storage and style!. ❤️
00275848,"Perfect for What We Need. We use this small shelf in our garage for a variety of storage needs. It works well for storage, but is durable enough, too, to use as a bookshelf if one desired. My husband assembled it in 20 minutes."
80275887,White double Kallax Cube. Easy to build and worked well with the metal frame.
20275885,Kallax. Works well and serves the purposes in my craft room
40415601,White looks Better. The black version of the Kallax had some scratches on it and didn’t look as nice as the white versions we have had for years. Not sure it is worth the extra charge as well for the black color. Used in my son’s college dorm room
89221055,"Excellent shelving unit. Great bargain on a quality shelving unit. Can be used in a row (as depicted in picture) or stacked into cubes, and other shapes."
20423720,"Works well, looks great. Slides a bit.. The shelf did exactly what I needed it to, turned a kallax shelf into a gaming station for console and accessories. However, there is no real way to secure the shelf, so it can slide back and forth while placing items on or around it."
09442720,Great item!. Love the look and space. Perfect for my craft supplies
09442720,Kallax. The legs on it makes it look I little more up scale and now it won’t cover a vent either so I was able to put it where I wanted. Love it
09442720,"Perfect for Sewing & Craft Room. I bought two of these units to store my sewing books, fabric, craft and business supplies. The cubes are larger than most other units (a real plus). I like that the units are solid and sturdy allowing each cube to hold heavier items. The smooth finish not only looks great, I don’t have to worry about fabrics getting caught on rough edges."
09442720,Great for display and storage.. I set this up in my basement and it holds lots of decor items and storage cubes. It's sturdy and attractive.
89442721,"Pleased. Instructions are good just hate I have to put it together, but understand that’s part of my purchase."
89442721,Nice product. I have the whole collection of kallax. They are just amazing how many things you can do with them.
80275887,"Sewing table hack. Using Pinterest ideas, I purchased 2 Kallax shelves and my husband and friend created an awesome storage/cutting table. I love it! Kallax is very sturdy and attractive. I’ll be buying another one soon."
20278167,"Perfectly versatile!. My entire family loves Kallax cubes — we use them for crafts, kids’ toy storage, garage — and they work wonderfully in all areas."
10305741,Perfect. Great for the classroom. The glossy finish gives it a nice touch!
00334536,Terrible design. This piece doesn't properly line up. For the price I wouldn't have bought it if I had known it was going to be such a hassle & waste.
10487816,"Perfect, functional shelf!. Excellent value. It’s light and durable, stylish and functional. I’m sure it will be in use for a very long time."
70286645,Looks great!. The Kalamazoo not only looks great it serves my purpose so well. I bought it to organize my granddaughter’s arts and craft supplies. I love all the organizing inserts available for it!
50481172,"Convenient. Love the size, color, and the space! They are amazing quality for the price!"
50481172,"Great!. I love this shelf unit! It was easy to put together, its priced great, its sturdy, and attractive looking! Thanks IKEA! I'm going to buy another one soon."
50481172,"good enough for light weight. two screw holes are not aligned well, but as a light weight stand for small/light items, it is good enough"
50481172,Nice. Nice
70309840,Base On Legs should be. Base On Legs should be available for this Kallax storage product.
90301555,Nice little unit. First time into IKEA products. Sprucing up a computer setup and using items such as the two bin Kallax for storage. Easy enough to put together and accessorize. Will be purchasing a few more as this one was a test.
80303437,Perfect bookshelf for plants. This bookshelf works and looks so much better than one I had found elsewhere for twice the price!
70286645,"Fit perfect, east assembly. I’m usually challenged with these assemblies but the drawers and attaching to the Kallax cubes was seem less. The drawers work perfectly which is not common for me."
00275848,"Great for storage. We bought this for storage at the foot of our bed, very spacious and sturdy."
00275848,Great shelf unit.. Great spaces for folded jeans & sweatshirts instead of taking so much space in drawers or closet.
80275887,Exactly what we needed.. Fits perfectly under office window between two desks for the kids. Great for storing books and makes a nice reading bench.
30495599,"Exceeds Expectations. The cases were much lighter and stronger than I expected, with a good finish."
20423720,Great for my classroom!. Love having the dividers in my Kallax bookshelf in my classroom! Easy to assemble and slides in the bookshelf easily.
90495695,I Love the look of. I Love the look of this inset.
90495695,Great for shoes. Wonderful for organizing
90495695,kallax. Simple to put together and holds my rolls of vinyl perfectly.
80275887,Poor assembly. I’m only on step two of building this stupid thing and already I’ve had an incomplete hole I had to drill out because the screw would not fit and now the shelves will not fit because the wooden dowels are too long. I’ve dented it in three areas and two dowels have now broken off inside the holes. I’ve been here for two hours. This is ridiculous and I’m disgusted.
80275887,Great storage. Great for student’s’ backpacks in a small classroom.
70339291,Plant shelf. Works great as a plant shelf.
70339291,"Perfect fit!. I was looking for something that would hold our receiver and turntable, while looking good with another piece of furniture. This was it, and it looks great."
70339291,Great peice. I bought this for my son's room. It seems very sturdy and just the size and aesthetic I wanted.
10305741,"Quality and Easy assembly. Fine quality, easy to put together."
00415599,It’s cheap and fell apart. The screws came out! The dowels snapped and I am out the money
40501892,"Love the Kallax line!. I love this line. Very cute, affordable, easy to build and so many uses. I love that there is a metal stand now too."
20409936,Kallax for home office and living room. I purchased three Kallax 3x4 units...two for my husband's home office storage and the third for the living room. I love the look of the cubes and they are very sturdy. I gave it 4 stars because each unit had at least one hole that did not line up or was too large and prevented pulling the joints together tightly. I had to re-drill or use glue and toothpicks to get the screw to grab and hold.
50334591,Does the job. I wanted a small storage cube to mount on my wall and this was perfect for it. Easy to put together and easy to mount.
50334591,Great wall storage option. Very easy to assemble and functional.
90305803,Entertainment Set. It's a beautiful entertainment Set for my living room. I have my picture and photo album on it. It's very sturdy and easy to move around the house if needed. Only had it for about two weeks.
30275861,"Pieces were cracked but was able to make it work. See above , concealed damage disappointed in product"
30275861,Sturdy and dependable. So happy we found these! Downsized into smaller home 1/2 size so needed to declutter and organize. These are amazingly strong for fabric and scrapbooking books and supplies. Highly recommend! Husband was even surprised of sturdiness when put together.
70301537,Kallax 5 x 5. Nice storage unit. Love the additional accessories available to enhance storage abilities. Need extra person to help lift up. Need to secure to wall. Recommend going to store to purchase due to long wait for truck delivery.
50214678,"Beautiful piece at a wonder price. I love this piece so much, it gives a luxurious feel to my bedroom."
50214678,Great product!!!. Great product!!!
50214678,Great Display Shelves. So glad we purchased this set of shelves - they are well-made and stylish!
50214678,"Simple but stylish storage. Competitively priced, functional, easy to assemble, and sturdy storage."
50214678,Perfect!. A little shorter than I expected but I’m using them to display desserts at My wedding so they are perfect!
50214678,Perfect!. Absolutely love the design of this piece! It works perfect in our space :)
50214678,"Beautiful design, perfect for storage and display. We have purchased 4 of these bookshelves because the first two were not enough. We each have two in our offices and they are perfect for what we were looking for. Assembly is very easy, I am petite, 4'11, 100 lbs and assembled two of the shelves on my own with no difficulties. When we did them together it took 15 min or less!!"
50214678,Beautiful shelf. I have several. Beautiful shelf. I have several pieces from this collection. Good quality!
80303437,It looks and works good. It looks and works good for my purpose.
50214678,"Free Standing Shelving. Great value, quality product and very easy to assemble."
50214678,Great Shelf Unit. Coordinates well with Vittsjo Coffe table and makes a room look like you spent so much more to decorate.
50214678,Great multi-purpose shelf. I purchased this to replace one that I bought 9 years ago and used on a covered outdoor balcony. I had to wait a long time for it to be back in stock but am so thankful it was not discontinued!
90324509,"Good looking shelf and easy to assemble. It was easy to assemble, at the end the whole structure feels reliable and strong, juat follow carefully the instructions"
60275812,Great versatile product!. Great versatile basic product. I used several of these in a spare bedroom for nightstands and cubbies to hold numerous items. Got the baskets and drawers to use in some of them.
60275812,"Strong shelving unit. Unit is nice, but the screws strip easily, making it harder to assemble."
70301537,"Awesome size for storage - looks great!. I bought this for my craft/sewing room and cannot believe how much it holds! There is even plenty of room on top for larger boxes or bins. Everything looks neat behind cube bins and I can find what I need almost instantly. Assembly is surprisingly simple, but I did need an extra set of hands just because of the size of the unit."
80275887,"Perfect!. I bought this for much needed extra storage and to use under my 65"" tv. The size and scale was perfect! The bins are very spacious. Easy to assemble by one person. Very sturdy. Such a great piece!"
80275887,Nice and neat. These shelves are very helpful to expand closet for tight spaces
30275861,Easy to assemble and strong. This piece holds lots of itsms
30275861,Does the Job. I got this for my studio it’s unfortunate they raised the price so much
90286649,New design. Prefer the old design with boxed sides v this new flimsy side panel. Looks cheap when drawers are open
20409936,No screws. I bought this thing and it came in but now I can't find any screws or pegs or anything. I've opened every box and Googled everything I can think of but I can't figure it out. It's been hours and I'm very frustrated as I'm not sure I can package this up to send it back since the boxes are torn now.
89386107,"Horrible and disappointing design. I've been putting together Ikea furniture for 20+ years. I saw a picture of the mitered edges with the keyhole fasteners before purchasing and thought to myself that this will work great or not at all. Unfortunately, it was the latter. The holes were not cleanly drilled so the boards did not slot together without significant force (even before I tried to get the last piece on). When I tried to take it apart, because I couldn't get the last piece on, it was impossible. Would not recommend ANY Ikea product with this new construction."
89386107,Not so easy to assemble. It is poor quality stuff.
60275812,storage galore. I have so many of th eKallax storage cubby units. They are amazing and I've even used them as room dividers.
29442677,FANTASTIC for storing Vinyl Records!. I had found another product to store vinyl records that was almost 3x the cost but it was backordered and I'm glad it was. This is so much nicer for a fraction of the cost. The construction is more solid and the stand makes it look alot more expensive then it is. It wasn't difficult to put together and is holding his 500+ album collection beautifully. This is by far the best solution for the price that I found-HIGHLY recommend!!
20423720,Kallax Shelf. Functional easy to use shelf
10409932,Great organization cubby. Easiest piece of ikea furniture that I’ve done. Very sturdy and just perfect for my grandkids’ toys and activities
80275887,Amazing!. I love the Kallax series! I have so many already. I live in an apartment and it's hard to get traditional bulky furniture up 3 flights of stairs. I bought some Kallax units to solve that problem! They are light but sturdy and easy to maneuver and bring move up/down stairs. I also love how I can choose which cubes to put in them!
00324518,Versatile. You have many ways to can incorporate this piece of furniture in any room. I like the fact IKEA has the option to add doors to it or drawers or you can use baskets or the foldable cubes. I love it!
20275885,"Classic shelves. Beautiful black shelves for the living room to organize all these books. This shelving is sturdy and the best I've seen so far, economical and practical. Doesn't take long to put together. I really like these shelves!"
40275846,Functional. Great functional and versatile set of shelves. I hung mine on the wall and couldn’t be happier.
40346924,"Good Quality. It is excellent for organizing and you can use it in different ways, it takes 15 to 20 min to assemble."
20275885,"Great for Closet storage. I used 4 of these in my master closet to neatly store my things. Easy and quick to assemble, allowing me to set up our closet in short order."
80275887,"Long time favorite…but. Our family has loved these shelves, we all have them in our homes, some have been passed down over time. Over the years we bought the Kallax’s predecessor (name currently escapes me). We were skeptical about the change to the Kallax but still tried them and found them to work. However, the nature of the Kallax has changed and I’m not sure it is for the better. Our older shelves were strong and heavy and survived several moves quite well. But these new ones are as light as if they were made from spun sugar and feel rather insubstantial, as if they are purposely made not to last. It was quite a surprise as it has only been a few months since we bought others so the change seems quite recent. Time will tell but I doubt we will buy any more."
80275887,"Beautiful, functional and durable. I love this shelving unit! The thicker side edges make it look higher end and it was easy to assemble. It adds some much needed storage to our house and so much more sturdy than the shelving units we have purchased from big box stores."
10305741,"Luving Kallex Cube Stands!!. This is my 2nd Kallex 8 Cube Stand. I especially love the high gloss of the gray one and the white one. These two exemplify an aura of modern furniture at a fantastic price! The high gloss make them the perfect fit for the modern look.  Kallex makes it so easy to put together and have great simple instructions to follow!! They do come in many colors and sizes. Also available are items to style your cubicles for storage! If you are looking for beauty and quality for a great price, look no further and get your Kallex Cube Stand today!!!"
10305741,"KALLAX. Love this item, but definitely felt like I was paying an arm and a leg for it."
00324518,"Kallax shelves are the best. These shelves are practical not only for the bedroom, but for any room - even the closet. I use them to organize books and kitchen items and my clothes and personal items. Inexpensive, practical and easy to put together are three ways I'd use to describe these shelves."
00275848,"SPACE SAVING STORAGE. I LOVE THIS UNIT AND HOW EASY IT WAS TO ACCESSORIZE. WE ASSEMBLED 4 OF THEM, HUNG THEM ON THE WALL AND USED DIFFERENT STYLE CUBES TO MATCH MY DECOR"
20275885,"The dim. Changed compared to my old Kallax. Bought 3 new units from IKEA for my new home and just realized IKEA had changed the thickness of the frames, the older one looks more durable and solid but thicker than all the new ones, had to find a different location for the existing one and spend more dollars .. over all they are still good though"
50481172,Perfect size. Nice little unit for clothing. I bought 4. They fit in small places or hallways.
20275885,"Good value. At ordered two of these for the kids playroom, to help conceal the unsightly amount of random toys! I had to pick them up from an associated delivery center (for a very reasonable fee). One of the shelves was damaged upon arrival, which I didn't notice until assembly (it was the LAST shelf). I notified customer service and they went above and beyond by delivering strsight to my door. The shelves are working great so far...time will tell on the wear and tear!"
00275848,"Previous version is much better. I had a couple of these series (2X4) of shelf at home. I've been a fan of this so far, but the recent version, which is thinner and not smooth wood and easy scratching, is not a good quality."
00275848,"Major problem. Received this not two hours ago. Unpacked and started assembling. There are printing marks all over the face of at least one of the drawers. I am not able to return it as I have no way to get it there, and even if I could drive 40 miles to do so, I have no time. No matter how much I like Ikea, I have to give this one the lowest rating possible. First time Ikea's let me down. The ratings below apply to this individual piece I purchased, NOT to the line, as a whole. I really do like Kallax -- just not this eyesore I'm stuck with. Yes, the product WORKS as expected. Just looks like misery. Can't believe I paid hard earned money for this. Apparently quality control was on lunch break when this went down the line."
00275848,Too narrow.. For a book case is to narrow. Most likely only 4 books can fit. Serves better as DVD display but you you loose half the space. Might be useful if wider and and slightly deeper.
20275885,"Worth every penny. Sturdy, easy to assemble by myself, looks great. For reference, I bought the 2x4 size."
80275887,Easy Solution!. Needed an easy cost effective way to increase storage in my condo and this unit fit the bill. Super happy.
50481172,"Love this little shelf!. This is one of my favorite shelves. I bought one and found it very easy to put together so I went back to buy a few more.   A tip I would give is to not tighten the screws in as you go. Wait until all the screws are in place and then tighten them all up at the end. I didn’t use the little middle piece and these shelves work wonderfully and look good too, imo!"
50454507,"Handy rolling storage. Moderately easy to put together, solid considering the materials, rolls well. I bought it to store documents and files as it was much less expensive than a filing cabinet. The top is the perfect size for my cat to stretch out and relax. My only wish is that the shelves were adjustable but that would have made it more expensive."
50481172,"Great little Bookcases. I got two and considering getting another. They’re the perfect size for my space. Assembly was easy, don’t think it took me more than 30 min to build both. I love how compact they are, yet can fit many things from books to plants and such. And the price is great!"
90301555,Perfect fit !!. This shelf finished our master closet project and it fits perfectly !!
50214678,"sharp shelf- looks expensive. Glad I purchased this, really added to my room."
80275887,Kallax shelving unit. Great addition to my closet!
50214678,Great Look. The shelf is exactly what I've been looking for. I purchased 2 of them and they fit perfectly in the areas I needed.
80303437,"It’s great but.... I had trouble screwing in the 2 little holes for the little triangle thing u put at the back of the shelf so I left one nail out bc I could not get it through, only half way. So I just left it out seeing I got 2/3 nails in. I also noticed already a few black marks on the shelf n a little scratch on the glass. I would buy this again but just upset with everything mentioned. I do love how I set it up for my plants"
50481172,"Good shelf - terrible assembly. It took me two hours to get this together. It is very difficult screwing the screws in - which is basically the entire assembly process. Some I couldn’t even get in all the way. My hands were all scraped up and sore post-assembly. Worth it for the price, but if you aren’t on a budget, you’ll probably want something else."
50481172,The product looked easy enough. The product looked easy enough to assemble. But it was very hard to put the screws in even with an automatic driver. I bought two but will be returning one. For the first time very disappointed in ikea product
50481172,So easy to put together!. So easy to put together! I bought one and went back for 4 more. Which says something since there are NO IKEAs in my state.
50481172,For the price it's good.. These are really cute. They're pretty sturdy. They should be simple enough to put together but they are a pain. The position of the screws is so difficult. Definitely put strains on your hands. And it didn't even come with a screwdriver that fit so I had to find one. Also on mine I Have the warning stickers on my poles and I can't get them off. That's why I rated it three stars instead of four. I bought four of them and they all had stickers there.
90301555,"Kallax. sturdy, easy to assemble,"
50454507,Fits my needs.. Easy to put together and fits my needs.
80275887,Great shelf unit. This shelf unit is perfect for my kids room. Great place to organize toys and it was easy to build.
50481172,"Easy to paint. I spray painted this shelf in Gold, it looks amazing now."
50481172,Difficult assembly. Very difficult position for a large number of bolts.
10275862,Great Storage. I got rid of my two smaller bookshelves and use this as a room divider as well. Assembly was easy and pretty fast compared to other large furniture pieces I've gotten here.
60324520,Great product. I use it. Great product. I use it in my closet for extra storage and it fits perfectly!
70309840,Great Display Case. Used 4 Kalax single towers and 2 single Kalax boxes to create an 18 cube display case for all the family’s sports memorabilia with room for a 50” TV in the center. Great space saver!
80275887,Kallax Shelves. The Kallax Shelves were perfect for what we wanted them for
20409936,"The Billy Bookcases are better. I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. Online it said they were in stock. Even at the store it said they were in stock, but they weren't. Since I do not live close to the store, I did not want to waste my trip and so I settled for buying the Kallax bookcases instead. I bought 4 of them, all different sizes. I was very disappointed.   Regardless of size they are held together with 8 screws and wooden dowls. The wooden dowls do not fit well into the holes. Since they are a few inches long but thin, a few of them broke. Luckily I have tools and my own dowl jig so I drilled them out, widened the holes and used bigger dowls.  I also had to use a rubber mallet to tap the dowls fully into the holes. I then had to also use the mallet to tap everything together because I could not push everything together snuggly and I'm pretty big.   I eventually got everything together but it was a lot more work than it needed to be. They can either use thicker dowls and/or drill their holes ever so slightly bigger so everything will fit together easily.   I never had these problems when assembling their Billy bookcases of which I have 12 or 13 of."
10409932,assembly not as before. The unit itself is fine once it's assembled. But the old design (was it Expedit?) was much easier to assemble. We had to use a hammer all the way through assembly on this one which should not be required per instructions
10409932,"Storage unit is good. My daughter's room smells like a funeral and has for many days due to the formaldehyde off-gassing. Legally it can have formaldehyde as it is not labelled as children's furniture. Also, I had this delivered and had two #2 boxes delivered instead of a #1 & #2. After approximately 5 hours waiting on the phone and being transferred around (yes, really) the girl completely messed it up again so I ended up driving to an Ikea location to fix it. So I paid $50 for delivery for nothing, wasted many hours and had no apology. I was and continue to be kind as I have worked in retail and know how it is. I would very much consider this information however if you have no vehicle and are hours from a location."
80275887,A great piece for any room. This was easy to put together and is exactly what I needed in my living room! I added colorful Bins from Target that fit perfect.
80275887,Great multi-function shelf. I have one in my entry hall with baskets for shoes and misc. The other is in the office and is a desk with plenty of storage.
10487816,Solid buy. Easy to put together with substantial shelves - very serviceable though I do wish the wood was not so soft.
50481172,Sturdy shelf unit but many defective screws. The painted surfaces were good and all the parts and instructions were in the box but it was difficult to assemble because many of the Phillips drive slots were off center in the screw head.
70342199,Better than expected!. Easy to assemble. Looks fantastic.
50481172,the quality is good. everything as i expected
60333954,"NIGHTMARE to assemble, total garbage. I've been assembling Ikea furniture for over 30 years for both my home and businesses and I have never encountered such a frustrating build!! I always read Ikea assembly instructions thoroughly but no matter how carefully I followed them, it was a disaster. A total loss for me as the thing was so shreaded beyond functionality just from trying to put it together that it went into the garbage because my nearest Ikea store is over 2 hours away to return its pathetic scraps. What a disaster product assembly scheme. Just go back to using screws Ikea!"
50305739,"Oldie but Goodie. Must have! Sleek,classic, durable and unit. Love it!"
50483289,"Vihals. Great product, a bit expensive"
00275848,Does the job. easy to build and def does the trick for storage in a small space.
00275848,wish it came in more sizes. great for adding on pieces but wish came in more sizes
69278335,"I loved it so much I bought a second one!. I purchased the 25 cube Kallax with 6 inserts about 6 months ago for my foyer. I love it and admire it every time I walk by it. It’s big, it’s organized, and it is very beautiful. The pictures don’t compare to it in person. I had been recently looking online for a piece for my bedroom. So I purchased the 25 cube Kallax with 10 inserts this time and it’s perfect for us. I am thinking about getting one for my son’s room as well. Both pieces have been worth every penny spent!"
70286645,"These are awful. If you ever purchased an older version of this you will hate this new version. You have to screw these into the shelving structure, so once they are there, they aren't moving unless you want to see all of the holes left behind. Being able to change how you used these in the old version was a great feature (especially if you move a lot). The older version had deeper drawers and were quite substantial. I am very disappointing in this new version. Quality is very low and it is not easy to install."
70286645,"The drawers are REALLY shallow. This looks like it contains two drawers that each take up roughly half the space in one cube of the Kallax shelf. WRONG - it has two fronts that each take up half the space. The sides of the drawers are roughly half as high as the front of the drawer. So, you can only store about 3 worth of stuff in each drawer. What's the point?"
40311873,Kallax. Cute little shelf unit!
70301542,Magnificent organizer. This has helped me organize my life.
70301537,"as expected. solid product, exactly what I needed and expected it to be"
70286645,"Works just ok. Works , but quality it’s not the same . The ones I got a couple years ago were sturdier"
60333954,"DO NOT BUY. I'm VERY good at putting together ikea furniture. This thing was impossible to put together, I will have to throw it out. A waste of money I can't get back."
00501889,Gives the kallax an elevated look. Assembly was straightforward and it makes the unit look a lot nicer. Would definitely recommend for the price.
10409932,"Great multipurpose furniture. Great multipurpose furniture, easy to assemble, style fits with already existing furniture and decor."
00275848,"Live it, perfect for storage I needed for toy room. Laid on its side in front of window,waiting for cushions. Great perfect for storage of toys in playroom,laid sideways by window and waiting on cushion"
20423720,Creating an art space for grandkids. Used several IKEA products to build an art and crafting area for my grandkids. Created a great space for organizing all their projects.
00501889,Great Riser. It was so easy to put together and attach it to my Kallax 8 shelf/cube furniture. It looks so great.
80275887,Easily assembled. Chair went together well
20409936,Perfect. Easy to assemble and works perfectly to store my sons books and trophies
20423720,"Extends space. I put three of these shelf units in my 3x4 kallax unit. They fit vertically but not horizontally. I was disappointed at first, but now find that the vertical shelves fit my needs."
60275812,Space. I love this product looks nice in my living room
90286649,poor quality. poor quality
70286645,Diminished Space. The drawers are very small. They waste too much space.
90495596,Perfect little piece. Kallax has changed my entryway into a fashion meets form meets organization.
49285817,Great Features and Use of Space. I recently purchased four white cubes. They have been a great use of space. They are very sturdy and hold hard backed books.
49285817,". Used these to create a couple of wall-mounted “floating” nightstands. Very easy to assemble. The wall attachment rails (purchased separately) make it easy to install. Just be sure to use appropriate mounting hardware that can support 30lbs or more. Not sure I would use it for anything too heavy, but works for supporting a few books and bedside light."
00415599,"Holes wrong size. The predrilled holes all seemed to be the wrong size. We broke 2 wooden dowels trying to fit them in the holes before we decided to return it. So the halves of the wooden dowels are just permanently stuck in there. And we had to keep pounding on them because when we put the little shelves into the big shelves, they wouldn’t sit flush against the big shelves because the dowels were sticking out too far. So I’m going to get the Better Homes and Gardens version I stead which I had a far easier time putting together. The instructions make more sense on BHG too."
10345073,Weird. Bought this item to separate paperwork. It attaches weird & creates a space issue at the top. Lose more space than you gain. It's not practical but it's pretty.
10305741,Great purchase. Found already put together in the as is department. Awesome
20275814,"Used to LOVE them. I just picked up 3 KALLAX two cubbie by two cubbie storage shelves. I have a whole craft room done in these storage units and I loved them so I went back for a couple more. This batch is AWFUL. The screw holes don't align. I had to sit on them to push them into place so I could screw them together. 1 shelf used to take about 15 mins for me to assemble, now more like 40 mins of wrestling the piece into submission so I can get it together. UNFORTUNATE!"
60275812,"Soft dowels snapped off. The kallax unit looks great, but was difficult to assemble due to the breaking dowels. The holes are machined tight, and the dowels are soft - 4 dowels snapped in assembly. Why not throw in a couple extra dowels?"
20275814,"Broken. I bought 2 of these and unfortunately the edge was cracked and split on one of them. Also I have bought several in past, not same quality."
80275887,"Solid classic, was not disappointed. There's a reason Ikea has sold Kallax for so long. It's sturdy and can be used in so many ways. This one is going in a bedroom to organize craft items. I expect to have this piece for the foreseeable future.  Side note: I bought Kallax in black for my living room earlier this year. A 4x4 with a 2x4 stacked on top, holding about 2000 books. Obviously very happy with my purchase."
00275848,These units are always a good choice. I have been buying kallax since before they changed the name alwsys a great product!
90286649,Such a great idea!. Works like a charm! We ended up installing without drilling into the cabinet and it still works great! Helps organize the little items and still give a great look!
20275885,Kallax. So sad not to have my Expedit as an option. These are ok but the others were far superior (I had them over a decade and 3 major moves). My recommendation is based sadly on the fact that there is no longer the previous version. Less sturdy at a higher price. Like the appearance with the wider edge of the Expedit.
70301542,"Good & long-lasting but needs better options.. We still have one bought back in 2005!!! That's over 12 years and no peeling or breakages despite it has been holding quite a number of books and the overall weight was rather hefty (although we did put the heaviest at the bottom and lightest at the top). We recently purchased a second unit with the intention to put it on wheels. If you think about doing the same, I would not go that route unless you plan to use it only for lightweight items, not books. Even with 1/2 the books it could hold per square, the whole structure would be far too heavy to use the wheels provided by Ikea.  We actually added solid wood strips some 5 inches wide running front to back at the bottom and stained them in a dark color. The strip have been attached with screws on the frame of the bottom plank (the center of the base is hollow). Those served as support for the wheels which added separately as they had a higher load rating (still ikea ones), but even then the solution wasn't a viable option because the unit became too flimsy feeling when under load and would be unreliable for use with heavy items. So the books went back to the old unit which we had to keep stationary and not add any wheels. And this one will be used as a movable partition for storage of lightweight items while providing some privacy on the other side of it. The plan was to use 2 of these but we had to change solution. Also during the test under load, the wheel left some scoring in our hardwood floor (apparently much less hard than the plastic of the wheels) so that was a complete deal breaker even if the unit would have reveal itself to be more stable when moved around. One aspect in which I wish the design would have been revised is to see the gaps that always form in the middle that is large enough to show the dowels which are supposed to connect the vertical square panels to the top closing plank. A 3rd screw might also help make the frame a bit more rigid. Mind you that we have not clued anything together to be able to disassemble as needed... so with that considered it's still a pretty sturdy construction given its price point and overall quality construction. We haven't needed to use the anchoring (we also have no kids or pets in the house), but we'd recommend it if you live in areas with seismic activity or have kids and pets, even if you don't load the unit all that much. I wish it had better options (like a set of 8 softer and high-load carrying wheels) as well as a better design for the insert with door, which ends up having a very poor fit in many cases and will need to be heavily tweaked making it the more time intensive assembling task... they should be redesigned and changed to a thin frame holding the swinging panel door with small pins acting as stops to prevent the door from traveling inwards more than it should. The back plate could be much the same as long as machining will be kept as precise as possible. That said, if you use this as simple shelving unit to hold some books and display small object, it will serve you for years if not decades to come."
70301542,"Nearly perfect shelving unit. Firstly, I love my Kallax shelf unit. It works perfectly as a room divider for a small apartment and looks great overall. Definitely need at least two people to assemble, if only for the part where you sit the shelving unit right side up. I would give it five stars, however, multiple pieces arrived damaged (paint chipped off, multiple ~2 in gouges in the particle board). I'm sure Ikea would have replaced the damaged parts, but I was already at my wit's end after trying to return another item over the course of four weeks."
89278259,Kallax. It is the perfect size and storage for our guest room. IKEA has great storage options!
70301542,"Nice Looking. The shelf itself is very nice and looks great. However, putting it together is a different story. There are no words in the directions--just diagrams. So if you have a hard time following diagrams you may want to think twice about purchasing. Advice to the purchaser: You will need at least two people to assemble this shelf, and you may argue during the process. Hopefully the two of you will get along.  Also, there are extra holes and have no idea what those holes are for. Advice to the company: In the future if you are not planning to use words in your directions it would be beneficial to the purchaser to at least label the the parts."
29278262,"Great!. Clean lines, holds a ton of stuff and works great in multiple locations in the house."
90286649,Very useful. My son has a kallax next to his micke desk and these drawers provide the storage that the desk is lacking.
50305739,Great smaller storage cabinet. No issues assembling this simple storage cube. Got the glossy version because the matte finish was out if stock. Was the perfect solution in my handbag room!
09442678,All of them. I think we bought every version of this shelf for our home. They were so easy to put together and look great.
90301555,Perfect!. Kallax units are well built and sturdy. They are perfect storage units for crafting supplies like scrapbooking and rubber stamping.
80275887,Great storage for playroom. Much nicer than those you find in boxstores
49442676,Kallax. I am using this as a large ironing board in my sewing room! Love that it fits the large iron pad and I have storage below instead of wasted space. This product went together quickly and easy enough for me to handle myself.
20473593,FJALLBO Collection. I have all of the collection
90495596,"Gotta love the kallax. I love how these legs give my kallax a modern vibe,  plus makes it easy to clean beneath. The whole system works well together."
80401292,"Looks good. I bought 2- I use one for wine, Prosecco, non alcoholic stuff and the other for water bottles. It looks nice in my Kitchen"
20301554,Perfect size. Perfect size to fit file magazine holders
30275861,"No replacement shelf. This could have been a good product. one of the interior shelves broke. Called Ikea, and they said they cannot replace it UNLESS you kept your receipt.  Seriously ? I'm willing to pay for the shelf, but you can't even do that unless you have a receipt. Ikea products are decent, but their service is such that you have to buy an entirely new unit, or keep the receipts for the entire life of the product. I'm sorry, but this really stinks Ikea."
70391038,Bookcase. Pleased with bookcase
80401292,Love it!. Easiest ikea piece to assemble! I use it to store vinyl for each current project.
00275848,Perfect shelf for my daughter’s room. It was easy to assemble and looked great with a reasonable price. It was an IKEA furniture that I was expecting.
19442710,Easy to put together and light weight. I’m small and cannot lift a lot of weights. This met the needs. I was able to put it together quickly for my 80-year old dad to give his place a small makeover. Definitely good value for the money.
40346924,"Good. Good, but they need more quality"
00324518,I love these shelves!. Very sturdy and easy to put together.
90286649,Drawer Insert. Love it! Easy to install! Love the versatility & the additional functionality it brings to my shelving unit.
20275814,All of them. I think we bought every version of this shelf for our home. They were so easy to put together and look great.
50305739,Work great. Excellent for the price!. Use this as a coffee bar area in our home bar.
60324520,"There are so many uses!. There are so many uses! From boy superhero shelves to princess barbie doll apartments, storage & decorative. Love the different colors also!!"
20275814,"Perfect fit!. I purchased these units to place under my hanging clothes in the walk-thru main bedroom closet. I use the to hold blankets, shoes, handbags, sewing machines and other items that are being stored in the closet."
60275812,Perfect Vinyl storage. Stores my vinyl safely and looks great!
50305739,"The protective film on the. The protective film on the shelf edges was VERY hard to remove. It had writing on it, otherwise I would have left it on the shelf."
60275812,"Just right. I found just the right solution to my need, and that is just what it is all about. Covering a need."
20275814,Products. I love it
50305739,I wish you had more. I wish you had more inserts for paper in stock. So hard to get.
20275814,Perfect for my LP collection. Easy to assemble. Looks good. Appears to be very stable.
20275814,Great look and function.. Works good for the craft room. Worth the money.
20275814,"Love it!!!. Very steady, easy to assemble."
20275814,"versatile and strong. These cubicles are made to last upright or sideways. It took an hour to put together cause I'm a senior citizen, but I did it. Make sure you build on a rug or on the cardboard it came with."
20275814,Fabulous. Fabulous. My son loves it.
70301537,For my Craft Room. Companion piece for my Micke desks. Would have liked it to come with a back.
80275887,"Versatile Storage. Love the Kallax units. So versatile for craft storage. Nice and sturdy too. We broke a few dowels putting this together and had to buy some more, but otherwise a great product."
00388633,High end look. These book shelves are a nice quality- made of real wood. I pushed 3 together to create a book wall and they look great and hold lots of books
70286645,Kallax Drawer. I love the kallax drawers. The open and shut so smoothly and quietly.
20275885,Perfect for albums. Just right for storing albums. Easy to put together. Finished dimensions as described. Cherry finish would be nicer.
60333954,"Like the four cube, this fits my albums good.. The store is hard to get around in. I felt lost and confused. Maybe better markings to check stands."
49294529,"Good but could be better. I didn't realize this isn't one shelf, rather its two shelves and there is no way to connect them to prevent a gap from showing when they're placed next to each other. I love the look and the size but I had to DIY a way to connect to shelves. Assembly was also kind of a pain when screwing into the woods pieces. Ended up using a drill to quicken the process."
80275887,The best self. I use this for my sewing room it's the greatest wish I could have room for more
40275846,Perfect. This perfectly fits the rest of my decor.
30530574,"Sculpture stand. Good quality, did exactly what I was looking for. I did not attach. to the wall , but used to set a heavy item (50#) on for display."
50483289,Great for laundry room organization. Fast assembly
50454507,"Rolling Shelf Unit. Love the small and very well made rolling shelf to store things in my craft room! Easy to put together, too!"
89386107,Great Item. Easy Peasy to Assemble (I did not put legs on them) and looks great in the spot I had planned for it. Holds oversize books albums. Another winner.
19386101,Super easy assembly. Great quality and really easy to assemble literally no tools needed. Very well engineered and thought out
20423720,"Great for adding extra space. Using this in the closet, this piece doubles my shelf space. Super easy assemble, sturdy and looks nice."
20409936,"So good we came back for more!. We initially bought a Kallax last year to replace a bookshelf that was falling apart. We use it for displaying action figures, girlpla, and gunpla, and it's perfect for that. So perfect, in fact, that we returned and bought two more units for other rooms in our house, and will likely get another one or two eventually. Easy to assemble, looks great, and holds a LOT of stuff for display."
60221683,". We bought this shelf unit as a cubby shelf for my daughter's playroom. I saw it online but wanted to see it in person before I purchased. Unit was better than I had expected.  Heavy duty metal material frame and shelves far exceed similar shelves at big box stores. Parts and assembly make the shelves super durable and the unit came with complimentary wall anchors to keep the shelf stable and upright -- not that they were necessary for us since the unit was pretty level and stable already. We have used the snap-and-lock storage bins from Walmart to store various toys and games on this shelf, rather like a large cubby shelf. It has been an amazing addition to the playroom and I'm so glad I made the purchase.  We've had this shelf for over 3 years now. We have moved and rearranged rooms and still this shelf looks as good as the day we bought it. Shame there isn't a way to include a pic with this review! Highly recommend!!!"
60221683,"flexible storage. Bought this shelf to store games, legos, art supplies, etc. in kids' play room. Very easy to assemble. Looks great. Recommend securing to the wall."
60221683,"Great size. Generic enough not be look too ""Ikea"", hard to find shelving units in a large size like this. Very durable but does need stability for safety."
60221683,Great looking. I’m very happy with this sleek and modern looking shelf unit.
89285820,"Love EKET line–sturdy, sharp & quick to assemble. Purchased to use as open wall storage in our master bedroom. Following the instructions only took a few minutes from unboxing to finished product. Used the matching EKET hanging bracket to mount–nice system. Love the EKET line–well designed and extremely sturdy."
10305741,Beautiful. This product was easy to assemble. Looks beautiful in my home. It's sleek and shiny.
00388633,Quality bookcase. I was very happy with the quality of the Havsta bookcases. Putting them together was easy. Instructions were very clear.
00388633,Good quality for value. This shelf was easy to build and looks beautiful.
29278262,"organization and good looking. My sewing and knitting supplies have a home. The construction was relatively easy. The space behind the doors does not allow full use of the cube, so is somewhat limited. The drawers work well, and it has been cat tested and approved."
29278262,Kallax shelves. I bought this to use in my craft room and love it. I bought additional inserts to use . Everything is easy to find and better organized.
10275862,"Great Product. Easy build, great design, holds a lot, perfect for Lego display"
39017486,"A little dissappointed. We love IKEA and have a number of shelving solutions from them but this one is a bit of a disappointment. Inconsistencies in the manufacture of the Kallax unit caused it to go together slightly out of square, with some gaps in the panels and misalignment of the face of the shelving. We installed cabinets and drawers and these inconsistencies aggravated the process and caused some misalignment of the cabinets and drawers."
00275848,Easy Assembly. These are so cute and useful and very easy to assemble.
09017483,"Great shelf. Was pretty easy to assemble once I quit using a hammer and just finger tightened the wooden pegs. Attaching doors are a bit harder, the holes don't line up and I will have to predrill some."
09017483,"Nice, but don't deviate. It's hard to compete with Ikea. Great looks, great price. I purchased thinking this line - Eket and Kallax, were compatible with each other. No, that's not the case at all. That bit cost me $70 in accessories that I won't be getting back. Otherwise the shelving looks great."
40423719,Great shelving insert!. Purchased a couple of these to store files and books in one of the new 1X4 units I bought for my home office. Super easy to put together and fit really snug inside the KALLAX unit myself. Only reason I took a single star off is that you have to be really careful when you put the shelves into the unit as they are not secured together; one mishap and it will come apart and can damage the shelves. Once in the unit though... surprisingly sturdy!
40423719,Shelves. I did not realize that this can only be used with another product and is not a stand alone product.
40423719,I bought 2 of these. I bought 2 of these and am happy with them.
10345073,. Y’all really need to make small ones of these because it can’t fit my shelf I have because it’s smaller than the normal shelf’s
40423719,"Product pieces were not ""square"".. Product pieces were not ""square"". Very difficult to hold together to insert into a kallax cube."
40423719,"Excellent, useful design. Fits perfectly into my Expedit. The only reason I did not give it five stars is that it only comes in white."
10345073,Waste if money. Not as efficient as the way it looks.
99932540,"Great piece, one small recommendation for improvement. This was surpisingly easy to put together, feels pretty sturdy, holds a lot and seems a really good value for the price. I got this with two sets of drawers which gives it a nice combination of hidden storage and open shelving. It wasn't obvious to me from looking at it online but you can set the shelves at different heights which is a plus. Unfortunately that leaves visible holes and the one thing I would recommend to Ikea for improvement is that you provide something to fill in the rest of the holes for a more finished look."
10409932,So sturdy. We got this to use as storage for our kids clothes. We were shocked with how thick the wood is. It is so sturdy and we don’t worry about the kids breaking a shelf. I was able to put this together on my own but it was tough. It would be better with 2 people because of how heavy and awkward it is to move around.
49442676,"Perfect for board games. Very easy to assemble, sturdy storage for our collection of games."
60278170,Works great. Fairly easy to install even though I was not expecting that much work. Got new handles for it to upscale the appearance
00415599,Very nice!. Easy to build.
50481172,Love the BAGGEBO line. SUCH a wonderful shelving unit. Looks so clean and can mount to wall for heavier items.
70286645,Drawers for Cubby. Works great little assembly required but no problem
50454507,Cabinet. Was easy to assemble instructions were ideal we will buy more good clean store
90495596,Great. Works like it was designed and easy to put together.
70301537,Love it!. Love it!
20301554,Purchase. Great
20275814,"Usually Great. This new kallax to sit next to my old one had terrible holes. The wooden pegs didn't go any farther in leaving gaps. Trying to pull the panels apart cracks them, and of course there are no extras anymore. The screw holes needed me to to scrape them out with a drill."
50481172,"Bookcase is metal and was. Bookcase is metal and was under $25...if I complain, then there is no pleasing me. Will serve the purpose I intended...light storage. Like all IKEA pieces, just review diagrams thoroughly, and you can figure out how to assemble. ."
80275887,Useful. Useful easy ensamblaje good quality
00324518,Nice color. Nice color
80275887,"Good quality. We have two of there cabinets. The sturdy way they are made, I’m sure they will last forever!"

30275861,Awesome. Lifesaver to keep toddlers room organized.
40415601,Nice customizable storage.. My Kallax unit was easy to assemble and the cubes are great to store a variety of things. I also picked up containers and drawers for several of the cubes which make it even more versatile.
59278307,"Good value for the money.. Easy assembly. Feels very stable, especially with the wall bracket. Very versatile in storage options. Just what I needed to organize my space."
20423720,Kallax insert. Excellent for storing crafts with the Kallax system.
30275861,"Sturdy!!!. I've purchased several storage shelf units in the past, from different vendors, and all have been weak pieces. This Kallax storage shelf unit however, is very sturdy. Very happy with this purchase."
00501889,Totally worth it. A major upgrade to the look of our shelf. Double check the measurements to make sure it fits your model. Easy to put together. Very happy with this.
40275846,Deforesting Romania. I would like this more if I hadn’t learned it came from ancient Romanian forest.
10409932,PERFECT 4 ME!!. This cubby storage unit is PERFECT for what I needed! I plan to get another one just like this and a smaller one for my crafting & sewing room! THANKS IKEA!💚
80275887,All of them. I think we bought every version of this shelf for our home. They were so easy to put together and look great.
50454507,Like it!. I love the oak appearance and how handy it is to move around. I liked this product enough to buy a 2nd one.
70342199,Fits right in. Serves its purpose splendidly well.
20275885,"Eh.. These are fine, but each time we buy one, the quality has gone down. We have several of these, the most recent ones are so cheaply made. Every part is basically hollow. But they work fine for why we need them."
30275861,Best piece for a Craft room!. I love all the sections and deciding what goes where. Adding drawers and closed doors was so much fun too. The teal tubs go great with my light green walls too. Love love love it!
00275848,Great storage bench. I used this in my grandkids playroom. It provides great storage and a place to sit!
30275861,Very useful. Very useful
40324516,Comfor. Excellent
60324520,Practic. Excellent
10345073,Great organizer.. Easy to use. Love the color.
40423719,"It’s working well.. It was a little tricky putting it together, but I did it and I love it."
10221685,"LOVE THESE! BRING THEM BACK!. I’ve had a set of these for a few years and it’s perfect. Well-made, mixes nicely with high-end and vintage pieces. I need another one, but they appear to have discontinued the product :("
10221685,Spacious. The drawers were easy to install... very spacious and sturdy. For extra stability secure the unit to the wall.
70309840,Harder to assemble!. Harder to get together than the double or the quad unit . But once together it holds albums perfectly.
50454507,"Nice piece of furniture. My daughter wanted this as a nightstand, as it offers plenty of storage, more than a traditional one. Easy to put together, and solid.  She absolutely loves it."
29442615,I love Kallax!. This product is great. It was super easy to assemble and the parts were high quality including wood dowels instead of plastic. I liked it so much that I've been back to IKEA to buy more of them since the first purchase.
70301537,Sturdy. Easy to assemble and very sturdy
20275885,Beware the product has changed. They are advertising this as the same product using the same stock number but it is of significantly worse quality than it used to be. I just picked up two of these at the Ikea in Atlanta and noticed that the black/brown box was 49 lbs where the white one was 74 lbs. Apparently the 74 lbs is the good version and the newer one that weighs 49 lbs is a junk build. Their website still has it listed as 74 lbs and it uses the same stock number (202.758.85)
80401292,Love the Kallax system. I’m kind of obsessed with the Kallax system overall and these inserts just add to my mania. I actually use these for shoe storage and they work great!
09481684,"Fantastic!!!. Bought this for my daugter i’m college. Made very well and sturdy. would def recommend. only down fall the connection is on top and it’s silver , otherwise love it!"
20409936,Closet. Fits perfectly in our new closet.
29336356,Eket. Good option - a little bit hard to put together - have muscles or a rubber mallet persuader available
10275862,"Dowels/holes not a proper fit. We were very disappointed in this after easy assembly of the micke desk and malm dresser. Either the dowels were too long for one side or the holes weren’t drilled out properly, and it took entirely too long to put this together. There are gaps on one side even after trying to fix it, and you can see the dowels. The other side is bowing. We ended up having to shorten some dowels while some others broke. We live 2 hours from the nearest IKEA and could not just exchange it easily."
89442679,Love this. We saw this at a friend's house and fell in love with it. Now we have our own and love it.
10409932,Excellent quality and easy installation. As usual excellent quality and easy installation. Nice design also.
99017445,Was sturdy and exactly as. Was sturdy and exactly as advertised
99017445,"Simple assembly, love it. Simple assembly, love it"
80275887,"The quality of this shelf is bad.. I can hear a sound when I flip the board, it sounds like there are many sawdust in the middle of the board. The board in the middle is also very fragile, it breaks when we try to assemble it with a rubber hammer."
40501892,White Kaplan frame. Perfect to raise the Kaplan piece from the ground. The frame makes it look like a piece of furniture.
20305745,Love the white. Nice
00415599,"Difficult assembly. There were several holes that were not drilled deep enough to fit wooden tenons into. Required heavy pressure to make items fit, which resulted in damaging product."
80275887,Very good. Very good
80275887,Perfect for vinyl record collection. Kallax is perfect for my fathers record collection in his new music den/office.
10275862,All of them. I think we bought every version of this shelf for our home. They were so easy to put together and look great.
89442641,All of them. I think we bought every version of this shelf for our home. They were so easy to put together and look great.

49442643,All of them. I think we bought every version of this shelf for our home. They were so easy to put together and look great.
20423720,Great Product. Assembles in seconds and slides right in no tools needed looks great
70342199,Nice Shelf. We purchased this shelf to hold small kitchen appliances in our petite kitchen. It's durable and easy to assemble and we expect it to hold up well over time.
20275885,I really really like this. I really really like this it was for what I wanted and it looks great no complaints mo see
10409932,Perfect for Craft Supply Storage. This unit was easy for two people to assemble and fits perfectly in the space I have for it. The cubbies fit 12” paper as well as two 6” bins side by side. My craft room is on the way to being fully functional.
30275861,Just amazing!. Just amazing!
30275861,Cube shelf. Great shelf for the money!
40275846,"Love these shelves. Great shelves I use many for board games, extra ""dresser"" shelves with the inserts, and fishing gear."
10324513,It's a great bookshelf! I've. It's a great bookshelf! I've added some LED lights in the back to add a nice effect on the books and objects that I put on the bookshelf.
20275885,Bureau Alternative. We used this in our closet to store clothes to get rid of furniture in our bedroom. It works great.
20275885,Great product. Great product
50481172,"Just right. For something so light and easily assembled, and moderately priced, this shelf is really quite sturdy. I'm using it for plants, so the open design is perfect. The spacing between shelves is generous. I may buy another (but that would lead to buying more plants...)"
60278170,"Easy to install, but some caveats. It was easy to install and adjust these, and the hinges seem to be quality. If installing these in the top corner slots, be aware that they block access to the wall anchor brackets, so you have to anchor the unit to the wall first.  If I ever have to temporarily remove them, for example to access the wall anchor points when moving the unit, I would worry about the self-tapping screws stripping their holes during reinstallation because they have to go into the thin surface material of the Kallax unit."
40275846,More than a bookshelf!!. We turned 2 of these shelves on their sides added some cushions and pillows to create extended seating (and storage) for our kitchen table!& love it!!!
20423720,"Easy to assemble, fits perfectly. Easiest Ikea piece to set up and put in place! No tools!"
60278170,Love their products. Easy installment
90301555,Great Purchase!. We needed furniture while we are renting and thought that this would be a great option. We bought several different sizes of the Kalllax collection for our living room. It’s been a great choice for our needs right now and be easily used again in many different capacities. We purchased the Branas baskets and they look great! It’s all very sturdy and well made!
50483289,Good. Good
00275848,"LOVE THEM. These are just what we needed...perfect for that extra storage/organization. We actually put a single layer of 4 cubicles on top of a double laying on their sides...strong, easy to assemble...neat...used the fabric bins in some and left some open for storing bath towels...will be back for another to organize the den. ❤️"
10391041,Simple and sturdy. Purchased as a storage shelf. It's solid and the lip on the back of the shelves help keep items secured
40275846,Perfect for vinyl album storage. Perfect for vinyl album storage
80275887,I use it as a. I use it as a tv stand. Works fine
90301555,Great for craft room. Live the Kallax shelves for my craft room. I have different sizes to fit my room.
40311873,"2 box Kallax. We have a wide range of sizes of Kallax boxes, this one works well in our small closet where we added the divider to stack shoes on."
50339292,"Before you buy it, do this. Go to the store and look at the display units, specifically the doors. Chances are the door on the right hangs down a quarter inch lower than the other one. Not knowing this, I purchased this unit and spent about an hour assembling it, only to find that the doors do not line up. If you are okay with the doors looking broken because one hangs down, then this is a nice looking piece. I am giving it one star though because of all my wasted time, which includes assembling it, disassembling it, and waiting in line a half hour to return it. If you read the reviews, you will see other people saying the exact same thing. The problem with the doors goes back over a year, and apparently is fine by Ikea. I emailed them and the response was a one sentence apology and a pre-written copy of their return policy. I am a big fan of Ikea, but this is the first time I’ve been amazed by their quality control."
90324509,Kallax. Perfect shelving for board games and so much more
70301537,Great Quality. Bought this to organize my office/craft room. Hold more than I expected. The depth is perfect. Will purchase another one for playroom.
70301537,This is a great wall. This is a great wall unit. Fits every decor and is very versatile. It would work for everyone.
90286649,"I like the versatility ,. I like the versatility , I can customize the unit to my needs and can change it if needed."
60278170,Good organization and versatility. I have two of these units. I like the ability to customize my storage and the ability to change it as needed
40415601,Good for organizing. This is the second time I bought this unit. My son liked mine so much he wanted one for his bedroom storage.
80275887,follow instructions. the new one it is much lighter than the same previous one
10305741,Great storage. Easy to assemble and sturdy. Lo e the gloss finish.
20275885,Good quality/price ratio and very. Good quality/price ratio and very easy to assemble.

30275861,I use for storage in. I use for storage in my sewing room. They hold so much.
59278307,"You can't beat these!. I'm so glad they are still making these. I have an old set that is still strong, sturdy & in perfect condition. These are easy to put together & solid! I highly recommend them. I added some of the various inserts for craft storage."
00275848,This item is a much. This item is a much needed add on to my closet. It has provided me with more storage space that I so desperately need. I would recommend this product to anyone.
00275848,"Flexible Kallax. Have installed Kallax units on the wall in vertical and horizontal positions as well as placed on legs on the floor. Love flexibility of inserts and have used doors, drawers and cubes for my installations."
29197572,"office/toy storage. Definitely not the quality I’ve come to expect from IKEA, it is particle board/honeycomb material which makes it light but prone to breakdown overtime. I got the oak color and I knock a start off because some of the pieces were scratched on the veneer/acrylic coating and it was peeling off. Overall it does what I need it to do in the space I’ve chosen it for so still a good deal."
29278304,"Hard assembly. The design is appealing and pleasant, however, putting it together is a different story. The inserts are not made the same size or the bookcase is not accurate. Was really hard to put it together since the inserts didn't fit properly, they look uneven and for the price and standards of Ikea, I was expecting better quality. I love their products but this one was not that great."
29278304,Partly good…. I give the cube 5 ⭐️ but overall I returned the doors and drawers because you have to drill your own holes to install the thick cardboard like pieces. I kept the cubes and just put the cube drawers I already had because ikea is still out of the plain black ones. I love ikea and have lots of their dressers and cube pieces but this one is just ok…
59278307,KALLAX. Not as good as they used to be but still better than anything else out there
29278304,Smaller size than before. I purchased this unit to match another I had and when I put them together the new one is smaller than the original. The openings are the same but the framework is thinner.

40409935,Great unit. Serves it's purpose.. Great unit. Serves it's purpose.
50339292,"Love FJALLBO. My husband calls this the ""fall out boy"" series because he can't pronounce the name. We have purchased 5 pieces of this series and love the modern feel and how it blends with our eclectic art pieces as well as homey furniture. These pieces are very easy to put together; would need at least a pick-up truck or box van as they won't fit in a standard SUV."
50339292,"Sturdy, works great. Not too. Sturdy, works great. Not too difficult to assembled."

30275861,"Awesome stuff. Works for homeschooling organization and other organization around the house. Don’t forget the drawers, dividers and cubby bins (cloth recommended). Definitely recommend this item!!!"
70342199,"Stand. Wish the top was a little thicker. Assemble took a while , several screws to hand tighten band requires flipping to be able to tighten"
40409935,Perfecto!. This unit is exactly what I was looking for and needed. I’m excited that Ikea offers several variations of this unit as well that both larger and smaller. 🥰
50481172,Perfect!. I had an odd niche in my laundry closet and this fit perfectly in there.
00324518,"Great unit. I bought this unit for my sons room. He has ALOT of stuff in it. I like that you can use the shelves for books and game systems, and then use the correct boxes to put smaller things in. Putting it together was pretty simple. Overall, very happy with my purchase."
50305739,"Very useful, well-made looks great.. Very useful, well-made looks great."
80275887,I hate white furniture.... But I love this piece. Enough space for my TV to sit on and my mischievous cats can walk behind it.

10324513,"Perfect for homeschool organization. Shelves are great depth for various sized book and hold a lot in each cube. It was a bit wobbly putting together and would recommend two people, but I put it together perfectly on my own."
80275887,Used as a storage shelf. Used as a storage shelf for my kids art supplies. Added boxes to bottom row. Works great and looks high end and is very stable.

40314640,"Quality product. I was completely satisfied with the product, as well as the finish after it was built."
00275848,Perfect horizontal storage. Easy to assemble with pictorial directions. Just what I needed to store supplies under a window.
40346924,Versatile. I have bought 6 for my littles and our home. We use one to put dusty dirty off road clothes and shoes. Office files look great. And littles toys in caddies are efficient and look great. LEGOS are displayed with great care. Let your mind wonder to wonderful easy options.

39278290,Nice storage unit. Bought this unit to use upright with drawers in each section for all my little things. It goes together easily and is very sturdy. I just wish they offered a 4-legged frame for this size like they do for the bigger units.
80275887,Very nice. Very nice
10477935,Great underneath my window. I needed a small cabinet underneath my window sill. We added the leg frame to it and it is the perfect height. Two kallax cubes on top of each other was to hight but this fits great.

20275885,Great for my sewing room.. I got my fabric out of the storage boxes and out where I can see them. This is working for me.
30275861,"So functional!. I was actually able to put most of this unit together by myself, and it looks great in my craft room!"

40275846,A Limitless Classic. I love the Kallax for its simple design and plentiful possibilities.
50481172,"terrible quality control. I've purchased and built 2 of these. The first one went by without a hitch. With the 2nd one, about 80-90% of the screw holes were not drilled/cut properly, and the screws would not go into the holes without incredible force. This, combined with the incredibly impossible angles demanded when using your screwdriver, meant that I spent three nights trying to put it together, got blisters on my thumbs and the tops of my knuckles, and stripped 2-3 screws.  It's a great price and works nice when it's built, but if you get a ""lemon"" you will have a terrible time."

80275887,Love it!. I’m reorganizing my craft room and lots of fellow scrapbookers have this item as it is perfectly sized for albums and paper. I’d never been to an ikea before so the shopping experience was cool!  My husband put the shelves together (I bought two) while I was away right after I bought them. My daughter and I easily moved them where I wanted them. I’ve gradually been setting them up and deciding what is going where. I bought four of the drona boxes and might want more.  I would absolutely buy again and recommend to others.
30275861,Love Kallax!. This is the 3rd 16 square unit I've purchased. I've also purchased 2 8 square and 2 4 square Kallax units. Love them!

90428842,A bit hard to assemble. When it came to the final step the last piece was hard to assemble. It wouldn’t go in place easily. I had to use the pieces on cardboard that came in the package to put under the cube and over the part that didn’t go in place and used a hammer to bang it down in place.

10275862,"Awesome shelves, recommend to anyone. Awesome shelves, recommend to anyone that enjoys organization."
80275887,"As Expected. I think it's a good piece provided you're not going to use it for very heavy items, or expect it to last for years and years. I think most Ikea items are more short term purchases than something that would be handed down. Saying that, I think their products are worth what you pay for them."

I put my little white retro style microwave on it, my pink toaster and pink bubblegum machine filled with chocolates. I also put 2 pans (pink of course) on the bottom shelf. I’m very pleased with my purchase."
49442676,Perfect fit!. I bought this as a tv stand for the guest room. I added storage cubes below and put books and a few other decorative items on the top row. The additional stand was a great addition to give it a nice touch.
90286649,"Size is not accurate. Dimensions are listed at 13 inches wide and 13 inches tall, but is actually 13 1/4 inches wide and 13 3/16 inches tall. The slight increase in size means it won't fit in my shelving."

50481172,"Perfect size. Good quality, perfect height and width. Bought two and was able to put decorative paper on one to use in baby room. The second one I put it in the restroom for towels and toiletries."
50481172,"Very Versatile Shelf. Nice sturdy shelf. Versatile - works well in pretty much any room of the house (kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, great for home office, on the patio etc.). Technically, one of Ikea's easier to assemble items since you just screw the shelves on. In reality, very frustrating as the screws are short and are inserted in a very tight area. However, I finished it and I'm back to buy a second one so it couldn't have been too frustrating LOL. I will say though if you have a screw driver with a strongly magnatized head, it will be a bit easier to assemble. Great quality for the price."
30495599,"Works fine but a few comments. The bottom of the legs of the Kallax storage unit are round but the receiving hole in this stand is square- round peg in a square peg- strange but it is secureside to side but there is nothing holding or securing the Kallax storage unit to the base except gravity. Ikea should have provided some way to secure the base (bracket and bolts). My heavy tv will hold it down just fine but had I not been using it for that, any upward pressure would separate it from the stand."

I am a collector of small antique Japanese porcelain and Chinese export antique cups, bowls, plates, etc.  I found the Vittsjo several years ago, bought one, used it right away and came back for more. Now, one entire wall of my living room is made up of these single and double sized units - about 10' long and now holding a total of over 150 pieces. Fairly easy to put together on my own (a second pair of hands can be helpful!), I even added small lights (also found at Ikea) that can be turned on with one switch and illuminate all the shelves. The glass shelves makes it easy to see items on each shelf. A great, simple display solution for the avid collector with limited space!"

89386107,"Cute and functional. Very happy I went with this version of the eket as a hallway bookshelf. I got another 4-chamber eket + wooden legs too to make it longer. I will say, I LOVE building ikea furniture and I found this one sort of challenging because it wasn’t the usual screw-in model. Instead, there were a lot of points where you needed body strength to fit things together. I ended up stripping some of the connection areas which led to minor cosmetic imperfections. Not enough to upset me, just a word of warning."
70301537,Kallax. Love the shelf but had to wait months to get it because it was out of stock.
20275885,So many things you can do with it!. I've purchased 3 of these units and two of the 4 cube units and there are so many ways to use them. They go together in minutes and are surprisingly strong for how little they weigh. The wall brackets are excellent to secure them in place.

I love the color choices, but I also love that I can easily paint them if I want too. I do wish that larger doors were made that just attached by hinges and not a box inside each cube. I'd love to have one door per side for some of the larger units. Other than that, no complaints at all."
80275887,"Perfect for kids rooms. KALLAX shelving accessories makes it the most versatile bookshelf/storage furniture. This was the best option for my kids rooms.

89442679,"Style and functionality of the bookcase. I really like the style and the color coordination. In addition, the price was reasonable. I really like Ikea's furniture. The only thing I don't care about with IKEA is having accessibility to the item. It took 5 months to get this item in. I finally got the item in March but tried to get this item in October. I believe they will lose customers because of this. I had to put my project redecorating my office on hold and started to look at other stores for this product."

40311873,"Perfect for what I needed. I purchased a stand for my record player online and the color was horrible. It was supposed to be gray and it just looked like a white washed wood. Since I already have a 4 cube Kallax in my living room, I put one of my records in the slot and it fit perfect. So purchased this 2 cube Kallax to match. Rather than have it on its side like pictured, I stood it up with my record player on top, the first shelf holds the speakers and the bottom holds all my vinyl records. The fact that it was half the price of the record stand I purchased, only makes me want to kick myself. I should have gone to Ikea first."

19442692,It was easy to assemble. It was easy to assemble and was exactly what I expected.
80334603,"Issues with assembly. Hi all, bought two for now, serves it's purpose for me, looks nice as storage sitting on a closet shelf, flexible to move, allowing for something on top and a pullout bin inside. Gave 3 stars because assembly with back panel seems impossible. Did not need back panel for closet storage and assembled without back. Sides which slide together must be hammered (to slide). Possibly can enlarge the wood holes so will slide easily (did not try). Would recommend for closet storage on shelving."
30275861,works well in my spaces.. works well in my spaces. '  Wish the insert with shelf was shippable...it would be perfect to double the storage when you have small things that don't take up that much space.
90286649,I put it all together. I put it all together by myself it took about an hour total. Very simple instructions to follow. Love it

49442676,Kallax in my office. This piece of furniture has helped me clean up my desk.
59278307,Functionality. I put 2 sets together and couldn't be happier. The 8 slot is standing and the 12 slot I've put on its side so I have 20 total slots with 6 doors and 4 drawers. Also I have 4 Drona insert boxes that look great and fit perfect. This all was relatively inexpensive and works perfect in our spare bedroom.
10409932,Perfect. I laid this 12 slot unit on its side and stood an 8 slot up to make a great storage in my spare bedroom. These are easy to assemble with simple tools. I have a battery powered drill so I cheated a little. I took my time and the result I am so pleased.
20423720,I was able to store. I was able to store 6 pairs of shoes in one cube of the kallax - works so nicely. I used another one but with the center piece running vertically instead of horizontally and that worked great for my purses.

99017186,Not exactly what I wanted. This is the 3rd Kallax shelving unit I bought and was disappointed that I couldn’t get the black doors I wanted. I have the black on the other ones and wanted the same for this one. I had to settle for white.

00324518,Kallax as tv stand. Wanted something with open storage for a extra large tv. This worked out great.
20278167,Bigger screws. They were easy to put together and look great however the screws that came with the product simply pulled out of the side on the first pull of the door. We went to lowes and bought 1inch lath screws that worked much better.
20275885,Kallax shelving. I love these shelving units. I currently have three of them. They are great and hold all my things beautifully.
00324518,It’s nice to use it.. It’s nice to use it.
20275885,"this can be usedin so many ways. This is the second Kallax I've bought and I love them. They are easy to put together, look great and hold a lot."
60510862,"Ordered 2 but one was faulty. So I ordered 2 of these and one had the thin back wood too long, making it literally impossible to assemble, so I ended up just cutting away at the edges, and eventually just shortening one side by about 1-2mm or so. After that it was perfect assembly. Took about 45min to do that one, but the second one wasn't faulty and only took about 5min. The act of ""pushing"" the pieces together however was not the case. The use of a hammer IS required to assemble."
90301555,"Kallax is always workable. Although (as usual in this economic climate) the actual unit that we were looking for were out of stock, once again we rethought our needs and put together a number of smaller units that work for out needs and can always be rearranged if those change. Too bad that the feet (pads) are no longer included."
00275848,A good quality product. A good quality product
00415599,Kallax. The only reason I gave the assembly instructions a four star was because it called for a hammer. I wish It would have said to use a rubber mallet. Because the hammer messed up one of the side edges of a board.
60333954,Eket. Great product. Easy to assemble and very flexible options for the space planning.
49189203,"great piece for the price!. This was a piece for our guest room. worked perfectly. Assembly is tricky when getting the corners to line up, but finally got it set. Looks great! Gives guest an option for their things and can store towels and blankets in the removable bins in the cubes."

40311873,Perfect. Perfect
00275848,"Easy to assemble, wall anchor, and use. My wife and I were looking for an organizer like this to place vertically in a corner of our small NY apartment.

20278167,Screwing into fiberboard?. Not sure how this product will hold up as doors are opened and closed due to stripping of screws into fiberboard. Screws are already unable to be tightened just after finishing assembly.

30275861,4 Square. Great room divider. Keeps things organized and looks great.
09278338,"A little underwhelming. I really love IKEA products and I have a lot of IKEA items in my home. I waited almost two years to get this Kallax 5x5 with 10 inserts, due to supply issues during the pandemic. So I was very excited when it was delivered. Assembly was a bit more difficult than I have found with other furniture I have put together. Some of the holes did not line up. One of the inserts was very damaged. The piece that is screwed into the cabinet is supposed to be all one piece that folds to fit into the cabinet. The damaged insert was broken into three pieces. I used some heavy tape to hold it together. Since I used the broken insert for drawers, it will never be seen and I think will hold together."
80275887,Kallax. Great in my Art Studio
20423720,Love it. Love it
40415601,Love it!!. This is the best unit
89307643,Door Doesn't sit even. I got multiple cubes but only 1 with the door which I'm regretting. The door does not sit even but it does open and close.
70301537,Love this!!. We purchased this for vertical storage in my sons small bedroom. It is perfect for all of his toys and helps free up floor space. I was pleased with how sturdy this is. I loved it soo much we purchased a second unit for my office.

20275885,Great for toy storage. Easy to put together. Looks very nice and is exactly the storage I was looking for in my living room. We bought the canvas drawer inserts too to hold loose toys. Perfect!
00415599,"Dependable and Reliable. The Kallax is always a go to, it is dependable and reliable, and you get what you expect."
39285827,Love these!. Bought these in multiple colors & both the smaller & Larger boxes. Made them into a hanging book shelf for my office

80275887,Great organizer. Great organizer
00501889,"Love it, but it's better if you assemble it ""wrong"". Major upgrade to our kallax that we had been using as a TV stand! However, I did not like adding the bracket to the outside of the shelf, so I flipped it, still on the same bolt, but I put the bracket in the seam where the bottom board and side come together. It makes a little gap but in my opinion looks much better than a bracket on the outside. I was able to reduce the gap by adding a little counter sink to the inside side of the hole just using a pocket knife. Big upgrade, just wish it was designed to be assembled the way I assembled it"
10305741,Glad I got the glossy finish. I purchased 2 to hold items in my office/sunroom. They’re sturdy and slots are perfect. Wished I could adjust one slot to hold my printer. Hired taskrabbit to assemble them - great decision.
90286649,"KALLAX is perfect for my vinyl collection. I have arrayed a variety of KALLAX shelf units in my office, where I organize my ebay listed items, shipping supplies. and my VINYL. The cubes are the ideal size, not too big to be inefficient with 12"" x 12"" items, big enough to hold oversized box sets. The simple add-on shelves are great. I use them vertically to make more narrow slots which keeps the vinyl more vertical and with less weight on them. I wish they came in black, I had to cover mine in vinyl contact paper. I have also used the shelf unit specifically designed for turntable etc and I am very pleased. The add-on drawers keep all my cleaning tolls etc. I now have the best setup for storing and spinning that I have ever seen."
69329387,"Make sure to purchase the combo that brings the metal bar. Architectural Digest Magazine instant look! We only installed them in rooms that had an outside brick wall. Ekets are a permanent room feature since they become part of the wall. Open each drawer pressing on the middle, close with each hand pressing on each side of the drawer. Great to clean underneath."
20301554,Great for decor organization. I love this design it chic and functional.
40409935,Great shelf and looks great. Great shelf and looks great in my daughters bedroom.

10409932,Kallax. This Kallax is perfect for my craft room. It has so many possibilities for storage!
50481172,"Baggebo shelf. My teen loves this shelf! We have had Kallax for storage in his room a long time, but he has been asking for shelving to display smaller items. I saw the Baggebo in store and knew he would love it. He did and put two together himself and arranged his favorite things just the way he wanted. This was a perfect solution at a price we could afford."
80275887,Great addition. I truly love the shelving unit - it gave extra storage space to my bedroom and leaving some empty to add decor items really brighten the room
00324518,Love the self. I love the shelf but the accuracy of what is on the selves vs what is showing online has not been correct the last two times I drove all the way to the store so pick up the item I was looking for. We aware of this! It is quite annoying!
69442680,Built an entire wall of shelving!. We used 6 units and three bases and constructed an entire wall of shelving. We used heavy duty threaded c-clamps to securely connect each pair of units together and to connect the resulting “stacks” together.   To save assembly time we used TaskRabbit to do the assembly. Well worth the $188 dollars. The Tasker did in two hours what would have taken us 6 hours.
30275861,Great quality!. Perfect size for my photo albums. Easy to assemble and made with quality.
90495596,Kallax base. Upgrades the look of the kallax unit.
80275887,"Best shelving for records!. These Kallax units make for perfect vinyl record storage. Ikea offers so many bits of shelving for entertainment usage, it's the premier place to build an entertainment room!"
50481172,It works for the price.. It works for the price.
70301537,"Super Sturdy. These shelves are build solid and extremely sturdy (that is, if you anchor them correctly). These shelves are an absolute must have for anyone with a large record collection. And with the various accessories available these can be used for pretty much anything you need, for a fraction of the price you will find in other shelving units. And as a vinyl enthusiast, if you ask any serious collector what the best shelves to get would be, it would be very difficult to find someone that doesn't immediately say Ikea Kallax. These really are the standard."
20278167,"Kallax doors. Great design, very ingenious."
20278167,"Excellent. Such a well thought out accessory for the Kallax shelves. A little difficult to assemble at first but I assure you once you get the 1st one put in correctly, the other will take less than 5 minutes each."
40423719,Kallax Insert. Love these inserts! Improved the functionality of my paper pad collection & looks so much better!
00275848,"Vinyl records. Been using this shelving for years. Perfect size sand even some storage accessories that go along with the product (bins, in particular).   Note to IKEA: I miss the 5x1 configuration, please bring it back."
40275846,"Exactly what it claims to be. This item is easy to assemble, sturdy and stylish. It has flexible functionality but I am using it for storage in a closet. Perfect size."
29442663,"TV Stand With Base. A Simple, clean and light weight unit when cocmbined with the metal base works well as a tv stand in my case a 55"" TV. I'll probably get the black baskets which fit perfectly into this or craft something simple to cover the back. I was worried that the round bottom of the legs would not be secure into the sqare legs of the base but they seem to fit without movement. But be aware that the top is not secured in any way- meaning you can lift this kallax right up out of the base. Of course the weight of the tv will prevent that from occurring but ikea should have engineered a way to secure theKallax base to this Kallax unit."
80275887,Amazing! Transformed my craft room!. Best ever!! Loved the way my Craft room turned out!

49442676,"Looks really nice.. This shelf compliments my other office furniture and is very versatile. I decided to add inserts for more functionality, but could have easily used without them. Not too hard to put together."
40415601,worth the wait!!. I went to IKEA to purchase this and you were out. I put myself on the contact list when more would arrive. I got the notice went to pick one up and got there just in time. There were only 2 left. It was meant to be and it is what I needed. Worth the wait.

10305741,"Easy to assemble but damaged parts. We purchased two of the Kallax storage units, the first one was perfect. When we opened the second box we found that both of the long lateral walls are damaged."
79442665,This was the first stand. This was the first stand I bought for kallax. It works great. I like that the cubes are not directly on the floor.
40423719,Hobby Supplies Storage. It’s not easy finding storage that is deep enough for my 12x 12 scrapbook paper. Kallax fits it perfectly! And the various inserts make each cube customizable for other items I need to store for my hobbies.

70342199,"Excited at first, then disappointed. My boyfriend and I purchased this piece to display our Legos and other little knick knacks. We loved the look of it in store but imagine our surprise when we got it home, assembled it, and not only noticed we were given the wrong sets of screws, but the entire thing is SUPER wonky. I think one of the sides is slightly longer than the other which makes the whole thing shift up on the right hand side. With items on it it is not as noticeable but I am not too impressed with this piece. We are debating on whether or not to bring it back. Very disappointed and I have a lot of Ikea furniture I’ve never had an issue with."

Very good quality and it's a minimalist piece. It adds to the TV room without interfering with the rest of the furniture but adding weigh to it, which was necessary. It is also useful because I store a blanket in one of the shelves, my sleepers in another one and tv stuff..."
39442691,"Great Shelf. We are very happy with the Kallax. I am especially in love with the stand! I think it looks so much better on the stand than on the floor.

They’re great for a kid’s bedroom to hold baskets, toys, books, etc. And they look great too. Using baskets allows you to bring in whatever color accent you’d like as well. For the price this is the best option for useful, decorative storage."
40423719,Want more. I love them!

20275885,Kallax shelf. We were looking for a storage solution for an abundance of board games. It looks great!
20275885,Great product!. I’m very pleased with my Kallax shelving units. They are very sturdy and we’re easy to put together. I purchased 4 of these and completely reorganized my office/sewing room. So much easier and less expensive than building from scratch.
10305741,Nice product. Only issue is too easy to scratch or take finish off.
80275887,Easy to assemble. Love the versatility
10275862,"Very sturdy and easy to. Very sturdy and easy to assemble. You will need two people to put it together, one to hold in place while the other hammers in the wood screws. I recommend a mallet, not a hammer. Looks great put together!"

My husband was not thrilled that I wanted to buy this but just last night he admitted that it was a good use if our space and he likes the color. Thank you IKEA."
80275887,Mr zJ. Great product!
70301537,Perfect sized cubes for modern. Perfect sized cubes for modern board game storage. Largest size requires two people to safely assemble. Wasn't too difficult but the instructions don't do a good job of indicating position of the shelves for assembly so I had to rotate everything to have the bracket side of the shelves (the rear side essentially) facing the wall.
20423720,great. great

70301537,"Book shelf. It’s bigger than I thought, but beautiful."
60275812,"Fit my vinyl storage needs perfectly!. I could not find a good storage solution for my hundreds of vinyl records at an affordable price. I needed something strong and durable. This was a great solution. These are not only stylish but they are strong. The only minor point is that there is no backing piece. If you feel this is necessary, you can always go to Home Depot and purchase low cost particle board and fasten it yourself. I find that I do not need it. As my collection expands, I will be purchasing additional units."
10409932,3 x 4 Kallax. I love my Kallax unit. Much stronger and larger than my other cube storage. And the assembly was so easy.
30275861,Excellent for a built in closet. Super easy to assemble and turned my closet into and organized usable space. I ordered it online with a set of drawers and a few boxes. It was delivered quickly. Absolutely love it!
09294526,These didn’t go together as. These didn’t go together as easily as most IKEA pieces. They didn’t always line up quite right.
30495599,"DOES fit older models. I'm not sure how long ago the other reviewers purchased their Kallax unit, but I purchased mine at least 10 years ago, and this base fit perfect. Maybe the company tweaked the design to accommodate both old and new model units, but whatever the case, my old unit fit exactly the same as the new units I purchased within the last week. I absolutely love these stands. For the price, they can't be beat."
40275846,Soild unit. Was super easy to assemble and looks great next to me my tv stand
20409936,"Versatile!. I have a few Kallax units. I love them because they are so versatile! We sue storage bins, amjave added cupboard doors, and I plan to look for mini shelves soon. They are very easy to assemble. The larger units do require two people to move. My biggest complaint is that they can be difficult to find in stock. I’m looking to add a 2x2 unit and the expected availability date recently moved out another month!"
40275846,"It’s good. The frame is a little thick, but it’s exactly what I needed"
20423720,Great purchase!. Very helpful in organizing paper in my art studio!
00275848,"Great for any space. I love these units. They come in so many sizes and really work well for any space. You can place them horizontally or vertical. When you leave the cubbies open or utilize the many other options for storage, you can't go wrong."
50305739,"Great product!!!. I love all of my Kallax units, so versatile for office and craft areas."
40423719,Love. Had to wait to finally pick these up but we'll worth the wait.
20275814,The best. The size is perfect. Other brands have such small cubes. Easy to assemble. I can find things now!
20278167,Love. Always a great buy.
40275846,Kallax. So universal in its uses
20423720,Great product!!!. Had to wait to be in stock but well worth it.
20301554,"Well built. We bought these to put an extension on top of it for shelf Kallax tower. It fits nicely, with the addition of felt pads on the four corners. It makes the tower a good height and adds more storage"
80487813,Love it!!. Perfect for my office!! Height is great and width is perfect!! I needed storage and boy did it help!!
10275862,Easy. Very easy but together.

40423719,Very handy for a crafter!. Very handy for a crafter!
70301537,Love these!. I transformed a spare bedroom into my art/craft studio. I’ve installed all IKEA products including this cube shelving. It not only looks great but keeps all my supplies very organized. I also installed some shelving units and used cubes.
30275861,"Love it!. This unit is exactly what I needed. It was easy to assemble, and it looks great and fit perfectly in the space it was intended for."
70339291,Loved the shelf just Dont. Loved the shelf just Dont like 8th at irs limited space due to bars being in the way
00388633,Havasta. Love these bookshelves. I like that the backs are open and you can see the wall and access outlets.
50339292,Love the Fjallbo collection!. I think I would buy each piece in this collection if I had the room. This is a great collection if you like modern industrial design. Pretty straight forward to put together…just pay attention to the instructions.   Big thanks to IKEA for providing metal shelving pieces!
20409936,"Just what was needed!. Purchased this on behalf of my religious organization for an attractive & functional piece in a room that serves various groups throughout the week. With the addition of attractive bins in complementary shades & textures for each cube, all the items for each group (which had been necessary, but cluttered) are now hidden--easily accessible, but stowed away until needed! Perfect solution to hold lots of stuff, organized but out of sight!  Please note that it takes 2 people to assemble easily, but went together in about 45 minutes, & is very sturdy!!"
20275885,Great for my vinyl. I have 5 of these now. I prefer the 2 cube over the longer ones. Just feel it’s more sturdy with all the records. Hold around 80 LPs per cube depending on jacket thickness.
20275814,Great space saver. Awesome small little cube to fit in the corner for all of my workout gear to go on.
20275885,Exactly what we needed to. Exactly what we needed to organize our son's toys in our living room -- stylish and functional!
40275846,Looks great!. As expected KALLAX was the Ikea product for my need. I do wish Ikea designers/engineers could come up with solutions/legs that would work around various base molding. I have to create my own to get the shelves high enough to get past mine for the support I need and pushed against the walls.
10409932,"I love it, perfect for. I love it, perfect for organizing and saves lots of space"
20423720,Great Buy. I got them to separate my CD collection. Works fine.
70301542,Nice product. I would love to see them add a way to secure them to each other on the sides but over all it looks great.
80275887,"This is probably 3rd or. This is probably 3rd or 4th Kallax I have owned. Easy to put together and available in different colors. You can stand it upright or on its side. Useful as a book case, or even a pantry for a small kitchen, I also use one for shoes."
30275861,Kallax. I found this unit to be great. The large size of the cubes is great. Extra strong to hold all my craft supplies.
00501889,"Kallax Base Stand. This has been unavailable in the Memphis store for a very long time. From the time I ordered it online, it took 3 weeks to get (I ordered it 12/15). It eventually shipped from FL. Thinking maybe the delay was because of the holidays. It was packaged good and no damage. Hoping this piece is back in stock in the store soon."
10409932,Using in sewing area Love. Using in sewing area  Love them set my cutting table on top

50481172,Good sale price! Works good. Good sale price! Works good for storing my crafts!
70301537,"Great shelving unit. Just as pictured. Only complaint is the hardware at Ike’s has gotten a bit cheesy. Plastics where there used to be metal, easy to strip break or over tighten"
00334536,"Clever design and assembly. Like the large capacity despite thinner side panels (vs Kallax). A bit pricier, but everything is these days"
70342199,"Laundry shelf. The shelf was pretty simple to assemble. I use it in the laundry room to hold all the chemicals such as the detergent, bleach, softener, etc. It's sturdy for what I'm using it for."
70286645,Add drawers to cubes. Easy to assemble ( our 14 year old put it together for her room). Nice addition to the cubes
20275814,Love it!. Love it!
10275862,"Perfect storage. Hold all my cute bins and all the stuff them, nice and neat! Love it!"
10409932,Honestly it was not easy. Honestly it was not easy to assemble…
40346924,"Perfect little storage unit. The storage unit was super easy to put together, took me less than an hour although I would suggest not doing it at night if you have neighbors lol! The hammering could get on their nerves, overall when it came together it was super sturdy and strong even though I each piece feels light and airy"
40275846,Put under my desk. I put the shelf horizontally under my desk. (I'm short) I put cubes to hold my purse and quick projects. Really like it.
70286645,Drawers are noisy. I LOVE the look of these- but agree that the drawers are deceiving- the sides of the drawers are so low it’s hard to utilize the space well! Also- some drawers make a clicking sound when they are opened and closed- and I can’t for the life of me figure out how to fix it?!?! Does anyone know how to fix the noise? We drove 7 hrs to the nearest ikea- so it’s not an easy return/fix for us… not really sure what to do…. LOVE the KALLAX look- the drawers are just a little disappointing with storage space/utilization. 😟
20278167,I did not know that. I did not know that it could be attached only right side or left side. I could not find definition that it wouldn’t be attached in the middle row.
20275885,Nice and Easy. Looks nice and is easy to put together. Can’t go wrong. Third one I’ve purchased in this model.
70342199,Nice Bookshelf. Easy to put together. Very sturdy.
50481172,"Sturdy, fits in small spaces. Great item to create shelf in narrow spaces"
70301537,Great storage. This was easy to put together and looks great. Is great storage for us.
20275885,Sturdy and nice design!. Easy to assemble and perfect for my son's room!

40346924,LOVE the look!. LOVE the look!
40409935,"Great Look - Great Storage. Love it in my office! Very well made. Beautiful color. Lots of cubbies for books, photos, figurines and artwork."

50324511,Perfect Storage. Fits beautifully in my office for the 56” system.
20275885,great deal. great deal
80275887,How do we fasten it to the wall?. I didn’t receive any screws with the wall fasteners. Do I guess at what to buy from a hardware store?
70391038,Not too difficult. Assembled in less than an hour. Recommended two people but can be done solo if you're careful.
80487813,Practical with clean lines. Practical with clean lines
00324518,Great Product. I bought this to display my sneakers and it’s worked out great!
70286645,Great storage. Redid a bdrm with Kallax. So great!
10409932,I love my Kallax. I have been wanting these for a long time. I was finally able to purchase them I ordered two so we could make a sewing table out of them. We turned them on on there side so they were 44” high and 57” long. We secured with a hinge from underneath and added 6 caster wheels so it can be moved around sewing room. Took my husband and son 2 1/2 hours from unboxing to completion. Was easier to put together than they thought. Seems real sturdy. Very happy with my purchase.
70483274,"Great shelf!. We got this for an awkward cubby area that we never knew what to do with but just looked horrible with any other storage unit we put there. It fits perfect and depending on the season you can swap out the cloth storage baskets or even personalize and make your own coverings for them. There are a ton of possibilities to make this look unique.   It was easy to put together, you’d definitely like an extra pair of hands when you lift it up and move it. And stays put. Glad we took the plunge and got it!"
10305741,Great for multiple types of organizing.. I use these for clothes in closets and for craft supplies organizing.
20423720,Perfect!. Just what Kallax needs to make it practical in my art studio!
20275885,Love your products. Love your products
40275846,Love it. I just love the Kallax lighting be hands down the best
00275848,Assembly of this was so. Assembly of this was so much easier and sturdier than the EXPEDIT!
40346924,Kallax Review. I can never go wrong with this . Very useful for many things . Made my kallax in a toy shelf in my sons play area
70388639,"Easy to assemble and sturdy!. Easy to assemble and sturdy! Wish there was an option to close the back as well, since the upper glass door cabinets are closed in the back."
20275885,"I Love It!!. These are so easy to put together, lightweight to move around and look great in my living room. Perfect for holding puzzles and other goodies and not too deep to make the room feel small."
60275812,Great addition to my office. I purchase 2 of these for my home office after going fully remote. Also added drawers and doors on some of the openings. Ended up going back for a 3rd and picked up some bins for it. Office is all organized now.
40275846,"Small Space Solution. I live in an apartment that only has bedroom closets. I use the kallax units to store everything from office supplies, hair care products, medicine, first aid products, etc."
79442689,"Great addition to my office. For the money, Kallax is great buy. Wasn’t too difficult to put together, and it looks good. I also like the additional pieces you can add — I got 2 sets of drawers."

10275862,Love it!. Great quality and pretty easy to put together. Totally happy with it!
10409932,"Sturdy and elegant bookcase. All the bookcases of Kallax (any dimension by any dimension) are sturdy and nice looking. It can be placed in any direction (3 or 4 ""cubes"" vertical) which makes it very practical and versatile. Each ""cube"" is the perfect size to store books, clothes and toys (using colorful baskets) or just place decorations. The top surface can be used as storage surface or when placed the long dimension horizontal as sitting area. The assembly is a bit labor intensive but that brings its sturdiness. I have already two of them and happily will choose it over other IKEA bookcase."
70301537,Nice piece. Very easy to put together and I love the new bracket to hold it to the wall.
30495599,Great product. Didn’t understand why. Great product. Didn’t understand why the price is different for the colors. I wanted the white but it was not in stock and the black cost more.
29278304,Wonderful piece!. This was relatively easy to put together. The doors were the most challenging part. It is substantial and solid.
50481172,easy peasy. i needed some scaffolding for my closet and this works great I could put it together myself too! I only put the shelves on upside down once.
80275887,Just as I had envisioned. I will be ordering more
60278170,"Sturdy!. The Kallax products are sturdy, easy to assemble, hold up well, & are a nice sleek design."
20275885,Easy solution for a small space. I'm using this as a dresser. My old one got damaged while moving. Inexpensive solution and works great. Stable enough for my 55 inch TV on too and a sound bar.
10487816,"Great product. Very stable, solid table"
10477935,I like this piece. I like this piece
10305741,Love. Love the quality of this shelving and the overall look of the high-gloss.

79442689,Shelving unit. Perfect for my studio blends right in. Had another unit that I combined and love the fact that there are now legs takes it off the floor and makes it look more sophisticated ❤️❤️❤️
40275846,Poor return policy. Very disappointed with this purchase. IKEA intentionally disguised the box to look undamaged so it would be purchased. We inspected the box at the warehouse and it appeared fine. Upon unboxing at home we found two big gashes in the board from pallet forks and when we matched the damage to the box we then noticed brown tape strategically placed over the exterior box damage! Now we are being told we must drive an hour and a half back to the store for a replacement item even though we sent pictures showing the damage was obviously hidden intentionally by the store. BEWARE OF ODDLY PLACED BROWN TAPE!!!!
89285820,Like it!. My daughter inhaled in her room as a book shelves and looks really neat!
20275885,Quick and sturdy!. My girlfriend and I built this in under 30 minutes and it's sturdy enough that she's using it as part of a bed frame. Works great!
80275887,I like it for what. I like it for what I need it
40311873,"Just perfect. I was looking for a side table to my couch but this is perfect, it matches the height I needed, has space for storage and also matches my other 4 space Kallax y have in my living room! Sadly it was the same price I paid for my 4 space some years ago! I guess that's inflation for you."
50339292,Magnets. I am happy with the product except for the magnets that hold the door closed. They are not strong enough. If you bump the cabinet the doors will open.
00415599,"Very disappointed. I never left review on my ikea purchases until now. We have 8 cubes storage version of this organizer and I thought the quality would be better since the price is higher.  It is very poor quality for it priced. It arrived damaged. When we were assembling the dividing cubes they were cracking already. I wish I could show a picture or a video. When you use hammer for pushing wooden sticks it cracks the shelve. After we assembled it, we couldn’t believe how unstable it was. It doesn’t hold well after all that cracked parts of shelves. I don’t have time to disassemble and return it. Have an infant and a toddler. Definitely waste of time and money. Just get 8 cubes version or other ones, but not this. Zero quality control."
00324518,"Fully versatile. It’s completely changed my space. I purchased two and replaced my dresser. I would have more surface area for my things like colognes, pictures etc. I have so much storage for clothes and books and knickknacks."
50305739,"High gloss headache. Purchased the high gloss white 2x2. Assembly was VERY fast and easy. However, it took me much longer to remove the protective film from the edges than it did to assemble it. If ONLY the manufacturing facility left a tab on the ends to help peel it off... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
29442677,A place for everything and everything in it's place!. I needed storage space for my clutter. I got the Kallax and added two drawer kits and four baskets. It is perfect. There is a place for everything and everything is in it's place. It was simple to build and I had zero problems.
80275887,"beware two different shades of white. This comes in ""glossy white"" as well as white. Which is fine, just be aware when you grab one, you need to make sure you have the correct white."

40415601,"Stylish piece. Nice, stylish piece of furniture with lots of room for storage."
20275885,Highly recommend for small spaces.. I use this as a TV stand. I like that you can display items and use the storage boxes to store items. I live in a small place so use storage boxes for dad's and seasonal decor. I also have the 4 cube one in bedroom. Use as TV stand and also the stoage boxes to hide extra bathroom supplies. I have had friends purchase this item to follow what I have done. My home is all purchases from IKEA due to easy to assemble and disassemble when needed. Be creative when purchasing items for multiple ways to use.

20275885,Perfect Storage For Craft. I need something to storage display my crafting supplies and the look of this unit caught my eye. The price sold it! I’m thinking about purchasing another
20275885,"Almost perfect. This is an excellent and versatile piece - super easy to put together and is plenty strong for the heavy books I put in them, and they are not too heavy so easy to move around. It would be 100% perfect if there was an easy leg-system that was adjustable.   The steel frame leg is nice but was too tall to have the shelf fit under my windowsill, I ended up buying couch legs that screw on but they are not very easy to secure in the thin wood--esp. in the middle where I wanted a third support. If there was some kind of attachment that would allow for flexibility on this it would be absolutely perfect.  Apart from this little wish, it is 5 stars, an excellent product."
10409932,Great for my closet!. I bought this to use in my closet and it works perfectly. It was easy to assemble and I did most of it myself.

10275862,Great product. Used as a room divider. This Kallax was great to use as a room divider to screen off my treadmill that had to be in our rec room. Great product. I used TaskRabbit to put it together and that was a great service. Well worth the $50 it cost.
20275814,Great Quality. I have two of these. They're very sturdy and look nice when put together. I wish they made a six-cube (3x2) version though.
80275887,Versatile. Easy to assemble and sturdy. Fit perfectly in my closet for storage organizer in guest room

70309840,Excellent Storage Unit. For years I had no idea how to use or maximize a niche in our bedroom. I imagined using it as a storage area but did not want to spend a lot of money. When I saw the Kallax units I knew immediately how I wanted to incorporate it into my room. Paired with the inserts he came together nicely. It was easy to assemble at the color matched perfectly with other pieces in our design.
60324520,Nice. Easy to assemble. Very functional.

00388633,"Great book shelf. I like that it's actually solid wood, not particle board. I finally decided to start adulting and have been buying these bookshelves to replace my old cheap particle board ones that were falling apart and sagging from the weight of all my books. I also like the ability to adjust the base to keep the shelves level . We've had some foundation work on the home so our floors aren't completely flat so being able to make those adjustments without having to shove something under the bookcase is very nice. The larger base is also let me store some larger books as well as board games easily. I'm on my 9th havsta shelf with plans to get a few more."
10305741,"Great Storage Cubes. Good quality and easy to assemble  Highly customizable and great for storage  Used this for kids room to organize toys, books, legos, and other stuff."
29442663,Nice piece. I like it.
40501892,Helpful accessory. Was pleased to discover that Kallax now had this base. Allowed us to raise up the cube wall and give it a little more height.

00275848,"Product is very easy to. Product is very easy to assemble, worth the price and looks good."
20409936,"Nice cubed bookcase for price. Nice product but takes a significant time frame to assemble. We wood glued all joints, shelves & joint Pegs to provide strength which slowed assembly down. We chose as color matched our other IKEA pieces. Just be aware that this is going to take awhile to put together. Put a couple 2 cloth baskets in 2 cubbies to break up the black."

30275861,Perfect storage solution!. Ideal for storage and sturdy. Love it!
40415601,"It is good so far, but took me 3 weeks to put together.. Customer service needs a little help. Apparently, no one knows that this particular product has the only 3x3 shelves with four holes on a single shelf.   I had a misaligned shelf while I was putting it together, and the dowels went through the side. I drove to Ikea to get a single replacement shelf.   They sent me home with a shelf with only two holes on each side. I called customer service, and they said they would send me a replacement. They sent the outside support, not a single shelf.   I called customer service and told them that maybe the third time was the charm. I found someone who walked me to the correct page in the product instructions and told her exactly what piece I needed. She told me she was writing notes and then never sent the board.   I called a week later to follow up, and they did not indicate someone sending anything. So I had to drive to IKEA— half an hour's drive, about an hour for them to make me the right piece—go home another 1/2 hour.   They don't want to replace the shelves; I would have paid for the correct piece. It was my error. But no one knew they didn't even have them to replace them.   Number all the parts. I would pay a nominal fee to replace something I broke instead of dumping the whole thing in the trash because you want to sell more products.   This is an environmental issue. They are inexpensive, to begin with. A bit more environmentally friendly would be to help you repair what you have rather than toss the whole thing and force someone to repurchase it or buy something different from someone more expensive."
50339292,I love this desk. This is actually the 2nd one that I bought. They're the perfect size for my office.
29442677,Nice kit good result. Nice kit good result
40311873,"Boxes. We have a 5x5,4x4,2x4 and mow a 1x2. Obviously we love them."
80275887,Kallax. Excellent product
10275862,Great shelf. Great shelf
50481172,Worst assembly but great value. it looks like ikea folks haven’t tested the assembly process at all.. esp with any real world normal people that are not professional assemblers .. all they have to do is to make it corners a little longer and put the holes down by an inch.. it’s possible
30495599,"Good quality and matching style, but I need a different height!. I bought the base leg to match my Kallex shelves. When I finished installing and stakcing my shelf on it, I realized I am short of 3 inches to place it back into my closet.  I plan to return the base leg and look for something else to support the shelf.   I loved the overall look. Really hoped I can keep it."
80275887,Great storage solution. This unit is awesome! It is versatile in how many units you use as well as if you use it vertical or horizontal. It's simple to put together and well made.
70342199,"Exact. Perfect size, beautiful, and strong!"
20409936,it's good.. it's good.

80275887,Versatile. Unit is s what you expected and more
20275885,I love it. I love it
10305741,Terrible plastic tape. This shelf seems to be great but it takes about 2 to 3 hours to get the protective coating off of the edges of the shelves. it only took 30 minutes to put the entire thing together but the plastic protective tape will not come off no matter how hard you try.
69442680,"I like it.. quite a bit.. Part of many new things renovating my condo. My piece is used as an old school stereo console. Cube spaces perfect for LP storage, and speakers. Vintage components and lamp on top. I am more enamored by its function, quality and cost than it's reasonable / decent appearance."
60275812,Great for record storage. I have a similar piece of furniture I paid far more for and I needed expansion. The Kallax was nearly a match and for significantly less
90428842,Sturdy. Great for a floating bedside table
20275885,Love it. I absolutely love our new Kallax furniture!
00415599,AWESOME!. Thus was our second time purchasing and we love it!
40423719,"These are nice. I love the idea and they look nice, just would love for them to offer different colors. Most things are customizable at IKEA - these would make them perfect if we were able to adjust width and how many slats in each cube. There is no wow factor, they’re sturdy enough and look nice. 12X12 fits perfectly in these btw"
40311873,"Easy and beautiful. Super easy and basic to put together. Looks great and I love all the features you can add to it, like the legs, which we still might do. I also like that you can install it as a floating cubical. Not sure which option we will do as it looks great just sitting on the floor as we have it now."
20275885,Great product. Great product
50339292,Fjallbo. Love this piece!
10487816,"Perfect Shelving. I have a lot of crafting projects, and these shelves perfectly suit the boxes where I store the projects. They are simple and low-profile and work well in my sewing room space. I am very happy with them (I got 2)."
40501892,What an upgrade!. With this added touch the kallax is instantly upgraded to look for fit for an office. Very sturdy!!
59278307,"I’m hooked!!. I love the versatility of the Kallax! This one looks totally different when the legs as added to the bottom. It’s more spacious than a book shelf and you can turn the cubbie into draws, open shelving, or covered shelving. The only thing I would request is more/extra wooden dowels for assembly."
70286645,"got this to go with. got this to go with my Kallax shelving, so the unit would be more than just a bookshelf. Perfect for things I don't want on display."
00324518,"Installation Easy, but.... The tiny wooden dowels are so annoying. Without them breaking, this would be an extremely easy project. However, they did keep breaking, so what would have been an afternoon turned into a few weeks while waiting for parts and having to drill out the old dowels. After that was solved, it went together easy, and looks great in my room."
80275887,"Great shelving!. Easy to build, great price, looks sleek, what's not to like?"
29278304,"Kallax perfect for craft supplies. Just moved and set up Kallax for craft supplies. Perfect size for scrapbook papers and very versatile with adding drawers, baskets or extra shelves for other art supplies"

20275885,Lots more room. Kallax is great. Along with the box inserts it adds attractive storage space in plain view.

49442676,"Elevated look - Practical Storage. I WISH I could have purchased the natural wood, but alas Ikea is perpetually out so we went with white. It elevates the Kallax literally and figuratively. Because of the quality of Ikea, the Kallax will be used and reused for many years as our needs change."

40510863,"Cute, but hardware is visible. Installation hardware was not included, and is visible once installed. I plan on getting some paper to put in the back of the squares to hide the hardware, but wish it was just a different kind. For the price, I think the hardware should have been included."

70301542,Large Kallax. This piece is amazing! Stylish and holds so much that was cluttering my home. I bought 3 of the large size. Only downside is that the side pieces didn’t seat completely. Good thing I had a drimmel tool. Took a small slice of each peg off and it worked like a champ! Definitely will be getting more of these in the future.

70301537,"pieces don’t fit on the side wooden dowels to the point that the side piece cracked. It looks decent, but there are noticeable gaps on the side pieces as the wooden dowels for the sides should not be as long as for the rest of the product. Definitely will not recommend to anyone until IKEA fixes that issue."

40314640,"Great looking cabinet fronts. Needed a huge storage unit with a few drawers for smalls & doors to keep the cats out of things. Couple of door fronts to give a nice uniform appearance. Definitely HUGE! Doors are easy to assemble, somewhat tricky to install. If you’re a stickler for an even hang gap, expect to be doing fiddly adjustments for a good long while. Work great."

I'm glad to see that they are finally available and (mostly) in stock again after the last couple of years.
20275885,👍. 👍
70339291,Nice. Works nicely and shelves are a good size. I wish the corner brackets were on the back side of the shelves.
70339291,"Pretty good, overall.. It's not as hard to put together as some here seem to suggest, there are a lot of screws to tighten, so a small electric screwdriver might save you some grief. About 1.5 hours at a leisurely pace to assemble, with hand tightening. Every connection is secured with a screw, no snap fit or glued parts. I was worried there might be warpage or misalignment with the steel structure, but it came out surprisingly straight and sturdy. One of the inner wooden shelves was a slight tight fit and took some pressure to squeeze in, I didn't notice any bowing of the frame or the shelf, but I'll probably sand it slightly just in case. I noticed the wood screws slipped when tightening about 3/4 the time, so I'd suggest going easy on tightening once you feel the resistance increasing. In any case, they offer sufficient support to anchor the wood well onto the frame. I wish the wood was slightly thicker and substantial, but it's not flimsy either. I don't know how it would hold up to moisture, but it does have a finish on it."
60275812,"Like the features. Has come in handy with the basket inserts, keeps things neat!"
80275887,LOVE!!!!. Easy to put together and fits all my books and misc things.
40311873,Perfect for a side table for my couch. Holds blankets and remotes.. Above
70339291,"Expect defects. Purchased July 2017, and the product was defective and damaged. Damaged part: One of the connecting posts that's supposed to slide into a connecting hole was busted and manufactured at an angle so that it could not enter in the connecting bit. I ended up taking a hammer to straighten the piece out, which luckily did the trick. Defective part: One of the long posts was not produced with the correct bottom. The bottom side of the posts have a place to screw in a piece, but one of my posts had two top sides, so the whole shelf is lopsided. I also ran into a lot of issues assembling this shelf. Some of the parts needed to be forcefully inserted. It took quite a lot of effort. For the price and design, you can't beat it. However, cross your fingers when purchasing that your shelf does not come damaged or defective."
70301537,Beautiful bookshelf. Well made shelving and everything I expected. Only disappointed was Ikea raised the price on the white shelf by $50 otherwise happy with my purchase.
00324518,Cube Shelf. Nice and sturdy and looks great laying long way
00314642,Kallax two drawers insert. I purchased the Kallax two drawers insert to go inside an Expedit (pre Kallax) I received from someone. It already had some high white gloss door inserts so I was concerned the new Kallax high gloss drawers wouldn’t match. It is a perfect match! I am very pleased with the drawers. Assembly was easy.
09442678,Wonderful addition. I downsized and needed a good unit to go in my smaller apartment. It fit perfectly and looks wonderful.
00314642,Gret Function and Design. Love that you can customize shelving with Drawers and Doors. We changed out the knobs for an even more custom look.

50339292,Turntable plus albums. I needed a piece of furniture to house all of my albums plus a turntable and receiver. This is a perfect piece for that. I would have l in Ed the wood to be more of a real piece of wood but I can always replace them later.

10409932,"Holds my record albums perfectly. Bought this to replace a crumbling shelf unit I had for my 800 plus record album collection. This unit is sturdy enough to accomodate them, and then some. Easy to assemble, also. I had the unit delivered to my house, so didn't have to bother with lifting it at the store (it's fairly heavy). Can heartily recommend for record album storage!"
40346924,Very simple to assemble and. Very simple to assemble and lightweight. Tools are improved.

40311873,Love these shelves. What I love most about these shelves is that I can use it upright or sideways. Another convenience is that IKEA sells inserts.
20275885,"Shelving heaven!. The clouds parted and the angels sang when IKEA created KALLAX shelving. It's perfect for everything -- from a large wall of books and decorative items in the living room, to all-things-office-related in my home office. I have this particular 8-cubbie unit laying on it's side creating an L-shaped desk with 2 other smaller 4-cubbie KALLAX units and a desktop. 2 larger KALLAX shelving units complete my office. They're functional and my office looks fantastic! I have space for laptops, monitors, a printer, desk lamps, etc. And with the DRONA storage boxes which fit perfectly in the KALLAX cubbies, I have LOTS of space for files, office supplies, and other miscellaneous items. I <3 IKEA!"
70286645,Great idea & assembled easily. Recently moved and could no longer fit a nightstand so I got these and use the end of my kallax bookshelf next to the bed now. Works great. Drawers probably wouldn’t hold up to a lot of weight but I don’t need them to. Installation is permanent because you will have to make a few holes near the front that didn’t exist before. Overall pleased. I jazzed mine up by painting the drawer fronts and adding fancy knobs.

40423719,"Great purchase. Delivered efficiently, easy to assemble. Looks great!"
00275848,"Using it as a bench.. I had a choice: Build a custom-sized bench as row seating for our farm table or get two of these shelf units.  Time and convenience were the deciding factors. I got two 'benches' that I can move easily, convert to wall units if I wanted, or stack them if that was desired.  We had a lunch with friends through s week and everyone was happy with the height of the seating and the ease of 'moving over' the smooth surface provided."
60324520,Basic. Very basic item. Hardware isn’t very sturdy - one of the the dowels broke during assembly and it’s impossible to get it out. I can definitely tell the difference between this and ikea’s more expensive products. Looks decent.

20275885,"Our new TV fits perfectly. Our new TV fits perfectly on it! We were looking for a tv stand with height, so this worked out great and the price was fantastic!"
20275814,Just what I needed. Recently moved in with my fiancé and needed to be creative with storing my crafting supplies as well as decrease floor space usage. I have this as well as the 2 cubby kallax sitting on top of my linnmon tabletop which have the alex file cabinets supporting it. These items together have solved my storage dilemma. And provided peace of mind to my fiancé. Wish I could upload pictures!

89442679,"Great case!. Love the Kallax case. Sturdy, easy to assemble, looks good."
20275885,Love this for college kids. Fits in apartment cause it's small plus it's cheap and kids don't need expensive stuff :)

40275846,Great product. Very versatile.. Great product. Very versatile.
40346924,"Wall mount. Its light weight and looks amazing, it is now mounted to the wall, it was difficult for me to figure out how to mount it if there is no stud in the location they have the screws near but it worked out with additional materials and its is secure now."
40501892,"So easy !!. We buy a lot of goods from IKEA, the simplicity of construction, the straight forward Instructions.. Believe me I HATE putting boxed furniture together, but IKEA has simplified everything"
20278167,Doors. Very useful and easy to install.
20278167,"Easy to assemble. Used with my KALLAX shelf unit, inserts were easy to assemble. Provide needed protected storage in my workshop."
10324513,Great Organizer!. We have purchased several of these units for our school. It’s an inexpensive way to teach students about organizing using “rows” and “columns”.
70301537,This shelving unit is fantastic. This shelving unit is fantastic and easy to build. It does take two people due to the size.
59442685,Sleek & functional.. This unit was easy to assemble and looks sharp on the stand.
80487813,"Perfect!. I wanted a set of shelves to bring order to my creative corner. This set is perfect! Simple, clean design and enough shelves to hold various projects in plastic bins that I work on to fill my Etsy shop with treasures.  The design allows for the shelves to be held together securely."
70301537,"Looks good, but some construction issues. This is a very nice shelving unit, and just the size I needed. There were, however, some issues putting it together. The wooden pegs for the shelving were the right size for the internal shelves, but too long for the frame. I now have small gaps between the shelves and the frame, which has affected the smooth running of the drawers I purchased. The drawers and doors I bought were very easy to put together, though I had to adjust the screw positions when attaching their frames as the screws on one side of the partitions hit the screws on the other side.  The other problem (not unique to IKEA furniture) is the impossibility of attaching the unit to the wall when you have baseboards."
60275812,"Perfect size. I was looking for a little shelving unit for the entrance of our apartment. We lost a lot of space when we moved to California from the east coast, but this little unit was the perfect solution to store shoes and my husband's motorcycle helmet in our small entryway. The most impressive part? I was able to put this piece together by myself when I was 36 weeks pregnant. I don't recommend it, but I was in a serious nesting state of mind!"
30275861,"The Kallax 4 x 4 is an attractive answer to storage, display. My wife and I put it together in an hour or two. Instructions were clear. It is a two person job I think especially when righting the structure for its final phases. We broke a dowel by twisting the structure slightly while raising it but that was easily rectified with some gorilla glue where the dowel broke off to provide the strength. Looks great and a great value but this is an item that might not withstand a move to another home."
80275887,Closet storage sokution. This solved my delimma with closet storage. I love the thicker frame!
40415601,"Kallax Shelf Unit. I already purchased one of these for another room; so, I knew what I was getting. Really STURDY and very handsome. I didn't have any problems putting this piece together. I have all my sewing books in there."
40275846,bookcase. I use it horizontally to hold my tv & put bins in the slots for other stuff
20278167,Great features. I bought it few months ago. After we assembled the door did not close properly. There is no door stopper so door can go all the way in. So we ended up putting extra card board between side board and shelf unit to make the side board thicker. The door stopped on the side board. It did not look perfect but works.
00275848,Easy to assemble. Bought two of these to hang on the wall. Easy to put together and easy to hang up.
20275814,Kallax for storage. Nice and sturdy storage . Use for my crafting shop really nice .

20275885,Great buy. Great buy
59278307,Perfect for my use. Bought 2 of these for my granddaughter's room to be used as dressers. They take up less room than traditional dressers & provide lots more storage. Plus they look great! I'm in my 70's & was able to assemble both units by myself with ease.

00275848,Great product. I enjoyed assembling your products
40324516,Screws are an eyesore. Really like these in their 2x4 configuration but in 1x4 on the platform the screws/hardware on the side looks hideous.

00324518,"Stylish, versatile, and sturdy. I love my black Kallax shelf unit. I've owned one for 5 years, used it as a vertical bookshelf all these years but I couldn't figure out where to put it in my new apartment bedroom without it looking visually obtrusive— until I rotated it onto its side. Such a simple adjustment, same shelf unit, but with the horizontal positioning I feel like my bedroom aesthetic just got an upgrade. It's so sleek and sturdy. I love it."

90301555,Great buy for a great. Great buy for a great product!!
70342199,A Sturdy shelf. A sturdy shelf for what I need. The make up is a bit odd- the appearance/ anesthetic of the shelves corners seem a bit backwards.

00388633,"Solid pine bookshelves. Finally, after waiting over a year for this item to be in stock, I ordered three of them and had them delivered. My new library corner looks great. I was sorry the price increased substantially between my first attempts to order them (just after COVID upended everyone's lives) and when they were finally in stock again but that's just the way things are right now. I especially appreciate that these shelves are made from sustainably produced solid pine."
10409932,"Shelves. Love the shelves. For the most part, simple to assemble. I did have issues with one piece, but used shims to hold it up a bit and was able to complete them. They are just as promised. The only other thing was the fact they weren't in stock and I had to pay for delivery. It should've been free. Since out of stock.. The delivery guy was awesome though!"

20510864,Dream Book Shelves. I Absolutely Love Everything about Them
80428852,Great add-on. Easy to assemble. Great add-on. Easy to assemble with other eket combinations.
50483289,A decent shelving unit. I bought one of these to compliment an office setup. These shelf ares definitely hold a lot of items and you could put electronics inside since it has cutouts for cables. I also like the matching accessories if that fits your use. My only minor complaint is the particle board - it's definitely not too strong although the price is also reasonable as a result. The design is small and simple so it will probably hold up as well if not better than a generic shelf. Overall I'm pleased and would recommend so long as you're okay with particle board.
89442617,Cute little bookcase. Perfect size for the area and easy to put together.
20275885,Work great and look great!. Work great and look great!

80275887,"Perfect for my small space. I moved in with a relative after retiring and am trying to pack stuff from a bedroom, office, and sewing room into one room. I bought two 2×4 Kallax units and one 1×4. Perfect vertical storage to organize a lot by a 6' wall. Also much better made than units I've purchased from other stores."
50481172,Great storage use!. This is easy to assemble I was able to do it on my own. It’s really a great storage piece and fits in small spaces
40346924,"I actually get my unit. I actually get my unit from the As-Is section. It was already assembled. It is also very lightweight, so very easy to move.

59278307,Nice and clean look. Nice and clean look
00415599,"Looks Good. Like many Kallax products, it looks good and provides good storage. I even bought drawers and baskets. My only concern is the material quality. When put it together, I can feel the boards are kind of cheap. Just standing there it feels fine. If move it a lot, I don’t know how many times it can last."
79442694,Issues w/ underframe. For some reason the screws are not going in all the way to connect the four parts of the underframe together. Either too long or not drilled properly.
20275814,"Perfect For Bromptons!. We use Kallax mainly for books and vinyls. But when we decided to get a “home” for my husband’s Brompton bicycle, we saw several videos of people recommending the Kallax. We got one and it was perfect.  The best thing is that even without the shelves, the frame itself is very sturdy."

40311873,Love the customization. I have the Kallax in various configurations in all of my closets. I like that you can customize them with doors or baskets.
70301537,"Great storage!. Great storage for my craft room/ office! I added a 1X4 at the end with a 1X1 on top to make a 5X6. My only problem was I didn’t check measurements and 1X1 has wide trim all the way around making it taller. Still works but taller on the end so just went with it! Also bought a 3X3 for another wall and a desk so my room is new, fresh and complete! Had a couple small glitches with assembly but watching assembly videos was a GREAT help! Knowing the parts and which end/side of the boards go in the right location is key!"
60275812,Excellent. Excellent
20275814,"I truly love ikea. I just love that I can take my little two door car to ikea and buy a big piece of furniture and take it home that same day. I needed something to put this huge tv I got for free on Craigslist but all the tv stands didn’t satisfy me. I just wanted some cubes! So I found these cute ones and instead of a tv stand I just got two of these and it was like $20+ cheaper :D it totally worked like I expected and it was super easy to put together. I also love that if I move these are easily taken apart for easy transport, thanks ikea <3"

80275887,Very pleased with this. Very pleased with this
50305739,Love this unit. The item chips very easily. Although I didn’t tighten screws as I went along the holes were not aligned properly. The unit kept popping upon one side. I had to use other screws just to keep it closed. Other than that it’s a beautiful piece. I use it for my tv DVR box candies and Knick knacks :)
20409936,Great item. Great product for the price and not too different to to put together. I added the drawers and it looks great as a entry piece.
10487816,"Perfect size. I have a small space and this was perfect to put the printer, copy papers, and some other office stuff."
29278304,The cabinets and drawers take. The cabinets and drawers take a little more time to install. Installing the cabinet door is the trickiest and have to drill into the paper like board and then into the cabinet
70301542,Best Bookcases for the money. I have purchased 10 Kallax bookcases in various configurations. My husband is a book collector and likes the fact that you can put books on both sides just like library. The current on is the biggest we have purchased and will be used as a room divider.
20275885,great record. Storage. Sideways. Redid bosses studio where it has expanded his space very nicely. Now he's shopping for more records lol

00314642,"Great, simple addition. We had our closets custom built and stipulated the size to make our cubbies. We bought these drawers and the little doors and added them ourselves. They look terrific and were simple to install."
90286649,"Drawer inserts. These drawers are so helpful with organizing my craft room. I have the Kallax 5x5 wall unit. I was able to store together in these drawers, all my adhesives instead of them being spread out all over the place."
00275848,"Great for closet. We bought this to help organize in our closet. We drilled into the wall, parallel to the floor. Shoes fit under it perfectly, and now we have a place to organize all our hats, gloves, and random things."
20275814,"I love these Kallax units.. I love these Kallax units. The dowels used to be too long, but it looks as if they've fixed that problem. I have six Kallax units in my home, and they work from appliance storage to bookshelves."
80275887,"Started peeling off at the corners. I was happy when I got it. After about 6 months, it started peeling off at few of the corners. Quite disappointing to see that as I always have a high regards for Ikeas quality."

10275862,great for records. great for records
49442676,Easy to assemble. Super easy and quick to assemble . I love the way the shelves look in the frame stand
00275848,"Turns small spaces into dense storage. This is perfect for small areas between other things, what might otherwise be wasted space becomes 4 spacious cubes for clothes, toys, whatever. Also helps with de-cluttering because a cube can contain the sort of things like alarm clocks or a jewelry box that you would normally think has to take up valuable space on top of a bedside table or dresser."
00501889,"A must buy!. My Kallax bookcase look so much better, the height and style is on point."

70286645,"Great storage addition to Kallax.. Functional drawers which actually hold quite a bit of items. Nearly easy enough to install, just need to perfect holding the sleeve while screwing into the cube. Serves as great way to utilize the cube spaces in the kallax system. I put wallpaper on mine to add some pizazz to my shelves."
80275887,Great product!!. Great product!!
00415599,Record Storage. This produce works perfectly for my record collection.

10275862,"Easy to assemble, great product!. Easy to assemble, great product!"
10275862,Great for the LP collection!. The order and pick up process was seamless. Give yourself enough room on a level protected floor for assembly. Materials and construction are solid and it took about 90 minutes to build. Great fit and finish!
60275812,Just right. Perfect for what I needed!
00275848,used the kallax with brimnes. we laid the kallax unit down and used it as a base for the brimnes units. looks so good together

40415601,Very versatile and a great. Very versatile and a great price.
90301555,Craft room organizing. Working on organizing crafts and it's perfect for the space I have. Love it!
30275861,"A little wobbly. I would put it at more mod a 3.5- 4 ish star rating but… It could be a builder error, after getting it put together my Kallax seems to be a tad bit wobbly/wiggly. Which makes me slightly nervous 😟 so I’ll be keeping track of what I put in it. Other than that it’s good! And works exactly what I need it for."
40501892,"Just What I Needed. I purchased the Kallax 8 bay unit 6 years ago. I relocated it to a more refined space the the legs completely transformed the look! What an awesome, affordable addition."
10409932,I Love it. I love my shelf very sturdy. I really like all the different accessories you have for the units.
20275814,"Great shelf unit for office. I needed a low, small shelf unit. The Kallax was a great solution. Easy to assemble and it looks fabulous in my office. I put Branas baskets on the bottom shelves and it is a perfect storage area that looks professional."
59278307,Great product. Great product
20275814,"Sturdy good looking cube shelf units. Had 2 of these delivered to home. Easy assembly. They are good looking, and a good value. I am using them for photo album & book storage, and they sit side by side. Color - white"
20275814,"Good Product, one suggestion. I love the Kaplan system. I wish it came with covers for the screws/turn locks. Or at least a purchase option through IKEA. Stickers or plastic inserts. They’re such an eyesore and if I want them covered I have to track a solution down online and order hoping they fit"
40501892,Perfect!. Perfect!
70286645,I love these drawer inserts.. I love these drawer inserts. They are perfect for things I needed to store in my scrapbook room.   They aren't the easiest to put together.   I was disappointed that some of the veneer pulled away at the top corner
40501892,Nice looking. Like how it keeps my Kallax storage cubes off the floor. Makes it looks a little fancier.
80275887,Toys for tots. It was used sideways with storage baskets for toys
20301554,Nice individual unit!. I bought to add to other pieces (5X5 and 1X4) but the trim on all sides makes piece taller than other cubes. Width fit with my units but ended up 2 1/2!inches taller than my 5X5. I simply put taller unit in corner vs returning so I still get the storage.
40311873,A Little More Organization. Just needed a little more organization space and this unit was perfect!
20275814,Inexpensive and materials match the. Inexpensive and materials match the price.
70332124,Must have. I trade these with my sister because I got the pink ones. Too cute!! You can place all your documents and books.

Hint: Run a bead of Polyurethane Glue before assembling the joints. Use a damp paper towel to wipe the excess smooth. Let dry overnight. A Solid TV stand for Mom & Dad's ancient plasma tv :-D"
20275885,"my husband and i love. my husband and i love the kallax series - it is so very versatile, with multiple color choices and either with or without baskets, boxes, bins, drawers etc, and appropriate in nearly any type of room, such as the family room and living room; the nursery, kids, parents and grandparents bedrooms and sitting room; the kitchen and dining area; the bathroom and laundry room; and an entry or hallway."
80334603,Wonderful. I have some other cubes and wanted another one. This was just perfect for my room.
59278307,Super nice. Super light but sturdy. Easy to assemble. Looks really nice in my craft room.
79278293,"I like the unit, but I wish.... ...there were better instructions/how-tos to mount the 4x1 Kallax on the wall if you can't hit all studs, as I see in the display ads. I have a 4x4 & 4x2 shelf units. I would really like to use this one as a wall shelf."
00275848,Love this module. Love this module

00275848,Great addition to craft room/office!. Great addition to craft room/office!
20275885,Perfect for Home Library. We purchased 4 sets of Kallax bookcases to create our home library. These units look amazing and hold many books.
80275887,"I like it.. I like it. I have the 4x3, 4x2 & 2x2 in my office/craft room."
79442689,Good item. I bought this to be a temporary TV stand as the one I want is several hundred dollars. In out of stock. Directions are not very helpful as there are no step-by-step. It took my daughter and I about an hour to put it together. My only complaint is there’s a black and white tape on the edges but I can’t seem to get off. It’s very ugly and distracts me from the beauty of the item.
59902658,"THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, NOW. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING, NOW WONDER IT IS ALWAYS OUT OF STOCK!!!!"
59278307,Great Product. We put this in my middle daughters room under her loft bed. We LOVE it!

90301555,Perfect tall nightstands. We needed tall nightstands and these work perfectly.
70301537,ORGANIZED. I used this in my kids’ room. The bottom part I did little bins for all their clothes and the upper part is filled with LEGO creations. It feels so organized and simplified when I walk into their room and it has their bunk bed and this amazing shelving unit. No need for a dresser or anything else. This shelving unit works wonders!
50334591,"Excellent storage option!. Functional, attractive, organizational tool. I love the EKET series!"
80275887,"Love It!. I bought this with the Kallax Base legs, and boy does it elevate the look! It so easy to put together and it looks more custom!"
19442692,Worked perfectly for the storage. Worked perfectly for the storage closet
70301537,"Nice unit but some of the screws didn't work. The unit was relatively easy to put together. We would have completed assembly in one evening, but of the 8 screws that attach the side panels, only 3 caught the wood properly. We had to purchase (5) #16 x 3"" wood screws to complete the job. That was really irritating. There are all kinds of videos and articles online about how the Ikea screws don't work. They should really do something about that."
80401292,Tube holding. I put my vinyl tubes here. Works well with my storage unit.
20275814,Great System. Great system to build out a room. I have several kallax units of various sizes in my office. This size will be used as my printer stand. Its sturdy and has versatile uses. Easy to put together.
00275848,Sturdy and elegant - easy to build. Kallax is my go-to for quick storage solutions. So much sturdier and better material quality than similar options from other vendors. Easy to build and light enough to build in one location and then move to another room.
89278301,"What's not to love?. Sturdy enough and easy to put together, although forcing the shelves into the dowels was harder than usual."
90495695,X’d. Works to hold material rounds in. Works well with my storage unit.
80275887,Great shelf. Sturdy and easy to assemble.
00275848,WHERE ARE THE SCREWS AND OTHER PLUGS ??? THE HARDWARE TO PUT IT TOGETHER. HOW DO I GET THE HARDWARE ??? TO PUT IT TOGETHER ???... JUST OPEN THE BOX TO START ... AND THERE IS NOTHING TO PUT IT TOGETHER...
50483289,Very nice. Nice looking shelf
10275862,Excellent storage media set.. Excellent storage media set.
10305741,Best Bookcase on the Market!. THis is the thrid KALLAX bookcase I have purchased. This latest purchase was for my college-age son for his room. He loves is KALLAX bookcase. We bought the cube bins for each square of the bookcase. He is currently using this bookcase en lieu of a dresser.

30275861,Love the Kallax!. The Kallax is a fantastic piece of furniture. So many uses and options. I love it!
50339292,Storage unit. Like the unit with it’s metallic doors on the bottom shelf. Would like this shelf in the taller option withe the metallic doors.
20275885,"Good. Easy, simple, good looking, and good priced. However, it feels flimsy when I was assembling it. After assembly it feels okay just sitting there, though. I just feel quality can be a bit better."
70301537,Immense. Great room divider for an open office.. I’m using my Kallax as a room divider in an office. It’s working great so far. It’s large so it definitely needs to be attached to a wall. The instructions on how to attach to a wall could be more clear. It’s the only step I had trouble with.
70339291,Gorgeous addition to my kitchen. I dont have much pantry space in my kitchen and this fits perfectly near some windows to let light through while still providing storage. I have plants on the top of the rack and I use the middle two shelves for kitchen appliances. The bottom shelf is for bottled water and other heavy storage. I wish the wooden shelves had pre-drilled holes though.
00275848,"Great sturdy shelving!. Easy to assemble, well made. I would definitely buy again. Highly recommend."
79442694,Kallax storage space. Like to put difference things and books too. Large and fills a lot of stuff.
30275861,Kallax great for photo albums. Jallax bookcase shelves are deep enough for even my large photo albums and there is enough space to arrange them well.
20278167,"Funtional Option to the Kallax. ""Easy"" to install! Easy to customize by adding cute knobs! Hides the items I don't want seen in my office."
80275887,Versatile. This was the 5th one I’ve purchased recently. I used it to create shelving space in a new closet. Worked great and was way cheaper than closet organizers at home improvement stores. Others were used as sofa table bookcases.
10409932,Perfect for organization. Bought this item to organize my twins’ toys. Setup was a breeze. Purchase two sets of drawer inserts as well. Looks amazing in our playroom. Definitely recommend.
70301537,Not like it was when I first purchased in 2006.. There has been change in the size and design of this product since I first purchased it in 2006. We lost that shelf in a flood in 2010. The thickness of the shelves are slightly smaller.
70286645,Super convenient. Bought these to use in the 4 cube Kallax system in my nursery closet. Works good as extra organized baby storage. Wouldn’t trust it with a full heavy load or things with liquids/oils.
70286645,Great product!!. Great product!!
10409932,Kallax kollector. I love my all of my Kallax units. They are aesthetically please and functional.
00314642,Never disappointed. The gloss finish is very classy. I love my new foyer.
70339291,"Great purchase!. I love the look, quality and easy assembling. I wish they made more items to match this piece, so I could finish my room and have everything matched."
60278170,Great. The doors make this unit look classy.
30275861,"Kallax forever. Of course Kallax is the best deal on the planet for storing vinyl LPs, but it can do so much more. Having 4x4 or 5x5 cubes to work with is liberating, and enables you to put things that go together in the same cube, instead of having to find wherever something will fit (where you'll never find it)."
90286649,Perfect nice looking drawers. Perfect nice looking drawers
70339291,"Solidly compact. Functionality: Great! Shelves are deep enough for a typewriter, but compact enough to tuck into a corner of my ""cozy"" living room. Also, you will definitely need bookends. The middle vertical bar is a little annoying if you need to pull out a book just behind it.   Assembly: electric screwdriver and/or drill very very _very_ strongly recommended. Solid wood shelves are _great_ but to screw the shelves into the frame, I did need to pre-tap the holes with an electric drill and then drive them in with an electric screwdriver. Otherwise, it came together really easily."
20275885,Great. It’s really nice!!
20409936,Great book storage. Love this look. Sturdy and includes wall mounts for safety.
90301555,"Great for my small space. This worked out quite well for the space I had. It would be absolutely PERFECT if it had a stand to match the 2 x 4 Kallax, which I LOVE"
59189127,Didn’t assemble correctly. The pieces would not slide into place and had to be hit down with a hammer and left it cracked and wobbly
20275814,Works great. Bought in the. Works great. Bought in the as is department so no assembly required.
70301537,"Perfect for organization. Did have to put wood glue in before entering dowels. I could tell from the display one that it would wobble other wise. Also fixed it to the wall. This is earth quake country, don’t want that all full landing on me."
30275861,Excellent Product. I have one but needed another so versatile! Love the white as it makes my room pop!
40423719,Very useful insert. Very happy with quality and functionality of this insert. Was easy to assemble and looks good.
70301542,"A great storage unit for vinyl records. I replaced wall shelves with this unit. It holds more lps in less space, and keeps them upright more securely."
00275848,Good product. Sturdy Easy to assemble  Fits in smaller places
20275814,"Great Piece. Really like the Kallax cube piece we bought. LOvE that you can add drawers, dividers, etc. they complete the piece. Very functional. My only complaint is that I wish it came in a 3 x 2 as well."
20423720,Looks good and super easy. A great way to break up the space and it is super easy to install. No tools are required.
59278307,Kallax. I love the space and extra stacking storage.
20275885,"Small space, coset shelving. This option turned out to be an excellent idea for moving to a small space needing closet organization."

10409932,Perfect for keeping small things. Perfect for keeping small things in place and organized
70286645,"Cleverly Designed. It is cleverly designed. But feels extremely cheap when put together. I don’t think it will last long or withstand any abuse. Like many IKEA products, it looks fine just standing there. But, what choice do we have if we want our Kallax shelf to be more versatile?"
80275887,"Practically Perfect in Every Way!. Beauty and Functionality in Simple Design! Easy Assembly. Dual layout with numerous options for individual needs and purposes. The sturdy durable, perfectly sized ""cubes"" may be enhanced with well made, durable cloth cubes, baskets, drawers and door options! The optional stand takes it to another design level. Best value and quality in comparison to other products similar to this! Great for any room!"
40423719,"great for storing paper pads.... cardstock, notepads and clip boards. beautiful once I lined it with pretty shelf liner. Easy to install. A version for 8x11 papers with a couple of vertical slots would be even better!"
70286645,works great. love the dawer option. Works great.
20275814,Great storage for my classroom!. Great storage for my classroom!

79278269,Good Price. Good Price
40501892,Sturdy Base. This base with legs gives my 8 cubby Kallax Shelf Unit the right amount of height. It’s sturdy metal and super easy to assemble. I love the overall look. I’m happy with my purchase and it’s so affordable!
20423720,Great addition to Kallax!. Tricky to hold together when inserting but works great when in place!!
20275814,R. The quality is not the same from years past
30495599,Love it.. Love it.
80275887,Love the ease and sturdiness. Love the ease and sturdiness of this profuct
50481172,"Works fine if you can assemble. The end product is great and just what I needed, especially for the price point. I do feel as though the price is so low compared to other ikea shelving because if the assembly. The top screw holes for each shelf is far too close and is extremely hard to angle any tool to properly screw in straight enough. We had to really push in with a strong power drill and screws still ended up angled. The designer of this product didn't think through the assembly. Even putting the screws on the outside would have been a far better solution. Otherwise the instructions are very simple, just flawed design"
00334536,"Look for the tiny 1. Like many others I got this shelf to store records as it’s a fantastic size, and like many others I had a horrible time putting this together. I needed to use a hammer on a towel to get the pieces to align, only to discover on the last step that I hadn’t started with the board marked with a tiny “1”. I tried everything to try and get it to work without taking it apart, but in the end I had to start over. Not only is the notch for the backboard deeper in the 1 panel, but the holes for the center boards are spaced differently and there is nothing in the instructions warning you about that. I got it together on the 2nd try but the whole process took a toll and the shelf is banged up. So look for the panel marked with a tiny 1 the same color as the paint - probably making it a bright yellow sticker would be smarter, Ikea - check the alignment with the center pieces as you go - I’m not sure why the holes would be spaced differently, but it seems like another oversight - and grab a hammer"
80334603,Not consistent in looks and unstable. I got 6 to build a 3x2 or stairs like design. Each cube is slightly different than the other and the parts to attach them together barely does anything and it vents at the front. I don’t recommend. Way too expensive for the what you get
80275887,Good. Good
20275814,Versatile storage. I have several of these around my home. They work as great storage and fit with almost any design style. I’ve used them with storage boxes and baskets. Easy assembly.
10409932,"Perfect!. Eight pieces down, and two to go. I’ve been designing a second sewing room using different sizes of Kallax in the room and the closet. It’s taken two years of purging and reorganizing a complete mess into a dream space, and it’s almost complete. Only 3 more pieces to buy and then the organization can be completed. I cannot WAIT til it’s done. Forced Covid retirement has finally given me the time to get back in the sewing room. I was still buying, but didn’t have time to sew. What a disaster. I finally have a complete vision (which my husband says is scary😆) of what I want to complete the room."
20275885,bought for my craft room. bought for my craft room & so far they have met my expectations
70286645,Gotta Love These Drawers. I purchased several of these Kallax Drawer Inserts. My Kallax Shelf unit is now very functional. I am a big Kallax and Ikea fan! They were so easy to assemble and insert.
80275887,versatile shelf. versatile shelf
10409932,Just perfect and more!. An awesome bookshelf just what I had in mind. It’s very sturdy. The space are wide and lengthy. I didn’t just want to grab a bookshelf at a popular discount store... cause you get what you paid for kind of thing.

00275848,"Just what I needed. This is a sturdy product with a small footprint. I was worried it would be wobbly since it has no stabilizing back, but it's great! It gave me plenty of extra storage space within and on top. I purchased fabric storage cubes that fit exactly in the openings and was even able to color-coordinate them with the room."
10487816,This shelf is ideal for. This shelf is ideal for the spot in my home!
10305741,Love the versatility!. We own 6 of these and love them! They are great for kids rooms when placed either upright or on their side. Highly recommend!
20275885,Abundant storage. These cubbies are versatile and good looking. I am using them in multiple rooms for display and storage.
49442676,"Assembly. You really have to follow the procedures . It took us 2 hours to assemble the first shelf because we followed the guide halfway from the beginning.   Since we needed to assemble 3 more shelves, we reviewed the manual again and it took us 20 minutes completing each shelf.  It takes two persons to assemble the shelf with ease."
50481172,"Baggebo. Very hard to align the screws, Had to use a drill to force them in."
70301542,"Wonderful for boardgames. Kallax is the premier shelving unit for storing boardgames. Sturdy, long lasting, ability to hold many, many games. Great price for value."
49336341,"As good as the picture shows. Easy to assemble, even the glass door part if you punch the hole correctly. Looks great and works great."
50481172,"Perfect little shelf setup. Used two of these for a book nook area for our child. Will likely purchase one more. Was easy to assemble, and assembly is not my strong suite. I did not use the back piece and this did not seem to compromise stability at all. Good buy for us/ our needs."
10305741,Excellent value. Easily threw this together and had it up - super glossy! Nice clean look and
70301537,Excellent product. Excellent product
40415601,"The holes weren’t properly done,. The holes weren’t properly done, not matching and made the installation very difficult to install it. It took me over two hours to complete the installation as a lady. I had to get assistance to complete this project which it was supposed to be a piece of cake to install."
40314640,Kallax door. amazing door
40423719,"My favorite new IKEA product in years.. The modularity of Kallax (and Expedit) shelves has always been their greatest strength, and it's why I've purchased more of them than any other IKEA product over the years. These shelf inserts are a FANTASTIC addition to the line. I got a few of these (and a few of the single-shelf models) for my toddler's room. It's perfect for his puzzles, and so much better than stacking them up (and safer when he wants to pull one out). LOVE THESE."

49336341,Love it. This is a great display box! Used it with the glass door and without. Very easy to put together.
70301537,"Easy Assembly, Solid Unit. Easy to assemble, I did it by myself in less than 45 minuted BUT with this size you really need an additional person to help lift it upright. It holds a lot of books. I could use a smaller kallax to finish displaying my massive book collection, but this unit easily held what i previously had on three standard bookshelf units (plus some more I had in boxes. Very sturdy. Definitely use the included hardware to secure to the wall as this piece can be a little top heavy (due to the size), but once its attached to the wall its super stable. looks great! we have a more tradtional style home (100yrs old) with thick original framing around the doors and windows, so initially i was concerned that this would be too ""modern"" looking, but it blends right in and looks perfect...actually it looks impressive. People have complimented on our ""library room"""
50481172,Good value for the money. Nice light weight shelf.
60510862,Good looking and effective. Simple yet effective storage.
20275814,Perfect for a dorm room.. Perfect for a dorm room.
70286645,"Nice look, design could be better. Love the look of the entire unit, but instead of an insert that needs to be screwed into a finished product, it would be better to have this pre-built as a cube and attached by some other means into the shelf unit. Would definitely help if I wanted to change things up and move the cube around in the cubbies and not have unsightly holes in the now empty cubby."
79278250,"Nice unit. Easy to build, highly useful"
49442676,Perfect for an open Montessori shelf. We love this shelf it’s beautifully made and perfect for our sons Montessori based play room. We use ours for toys and it works perfect for us. I put it together alone even though it recommends two people I had no issues and it only took me about 30 minutes.
20275885,Great shelves. My teenager used this to organize space in her room.
10409932,IKEA is better than the knock-offs!. Kallix was out of stock so I bought one online from another manufacturer. It was flimsy and the openings don’t fit any cubes I’ve been able to find so I ended up replacing it when the Kallix baca me available.
80275887,Works great. Met our needs quite well!

20275814,kallax cube. I bought this to use in my home office to hold my printer. I have a black one that I bought years ago. Very easy to put together
70301537,"Looks more expensive than it is. One really does need two people to assemble the larger shelves, but they look very modern and are more substantial than some of the other alternatives."
20454504,"Super handy!. We keep this under the table as a place to organize notebooks, laptops, and cables that have shown up now that we work from home. The casters are not very effective at keeping it in place."
40423719,Excellent. Love it! I have set 2 up with all the shelves and one up with only half the shelves and they are amazing…… the only thing I could wish for is to have in the black/brown color to match my cabinet.
70286645,"Great Kallax Drawer Insert. The Kallax drawer insert is so useful and is a great addition to the Kallax shelf unit. It was so easy to put together using the instructions, and it has held up well."
10275862,Nice storage unit for board. Nice storage unit for board games.
00275848,Great shelf. This is the best shelving unit!!! It's sturdy and looks good. Somewhat easy to put together too.
50481172,Works good for a restroom. Works good for a restroom shelf some of screws stripped other than that it works great
70301537,Shelving. We love the quality!
70332124,Good enough. It was the only cube storage that could fit in the space I had. It’s good enough for storage but it was a pain to get the pieces to align correctly.
20454504,Love it. Perfect little cart. Working just as I had hoped. Will get more from this collections.
20409936,"Kallax shelf. Sturdy, functional and attractive. Very easy to assemble. This was exactly the organizational piece I needed."
80275887,good. good
50481172,A Nice Shelf for My Scentsy Business. A nice shelving unit at a very affordable price. Easy to assemble. Good quality for the price. Holds my Scentsy inventory beautifully!
40423719,"So much versatility. This shelf adds so much versatility. This works well for stacking laptops, tablets, and small objects. Also works well for sorting paper sizes and colors. Lastly, I have small storage containers that fit well, too."
80275887,Great product.. Great product.
20423720,"This shelf insert is easy. This shelf insert is easy to put together and slip into a kallax cube space. If you place the felt pads just right, the shelves stay in place sturdily as you move things around on the shelves. This is my favorite kallax accessory as you can use it and still remove if you change your mind."
49285817,I like it!!. I like it!!
10487816,"RECORD SHELF. If you look up “ Record shelves “ you get items that are priced in the hundreds. But guess what? This shelf PERFECTLY fits a nice little victoria record player on top, and PERFECTLY fits vinyls into the shelves! An absolutely godsend for me, and a nice little record shelf makes the space look absolutely amazing. Had been eyeing this shelf for months and saved specifically to buy it. So in love, and SO easy to build :) thank you ikea!!! 10/10"
50305739,Glossy and great. The glossy white Kallax is one of those IKEA pieces that is such a great price point for how modern it feels. The 4 square version was easy to put together solo. And I paired it next to a larger one I bought years ago. This is a great extension that was in budget and looks seamless. Highly rec. and go glossy — it’s the best of all the colors
00334536,"Two of the plastic pieces. Two of the plastic pieces broke, I had to use gorilla glue because it was too far to go back to store."
40415192,"Living room set. We purchased two of the bookshelves plus the TV console to make a living room set. It looks amazing! My husband, son, and I worked together assembling the three pieces. Fun family project!"
00275848,I like this product. I like this product
20275885,Very sturdy and great for Organization. Bought these for the classroom. Very happy with the sturdiness of these shelves. Will buy again!!!
20278167,Multi purpose Kallax. Easy to put together. We installed a mix of drawers and cabinets and it works well for our needs. Will purchase more in the future for our vinyl record collection.
09398675,"Good console set up. Very nice console set up, turns our living room into a real “adulting” space"
50481172,"BAGGEBO SHELF. We used it as extra shelf in our closet, turned out amazing! Very easy to assemble, not to small, not too big, just perfect!"
20454504,"Easy to roll. Easy to roll from room to room, but small. Would have liked it better if one shelf had been adjustable. Sturdy and good materials. A bit expensive for what it is."
40423719,Great Storage Solution. I bought two of these for my daughter's art station and they are amazing. Super easy to assemble and they look great!
00415599,"Love this for any kids. Love this for any kids bedroom. I bought the inserts too, so my 7 year old has the top row as drawers and for the bottom row we bought the baskets. These are great for toy or sports storage. The only thing I wished Ikea had the frame to put the Kallax on it. I think they only have it for the 4 square row bottoms and the 2 square row bottom I will verify this, if Ikea has the stand for the 3 square row bottom, I will be buying it, since it would make it easier to mop. All in all very happy with purchase."
50481172,"Just awful.. None of the screws (none!) go in all the way, and the end result is unsturdy and useless. Would absolutely not recommend."
80487813,Good product!. Bought for a craft room for storage. Easily assembled and strong enough for my needs.
20301554,Excellent. Excellent
50481172,baggebo. Great for storage in closet
49442676,"Versatile. I purchased the KALLAX storage for my office space. I particularly like that it can be horizontal or vertical and I can raise it up on legs. Mine is horizontal with leg base. The best part is being able to choose from several different inserts in to the cube openings to accomodate all my office storage needs (drawers, shelves, pull out bins, etc.)"
60510862,"Doesn’t fit together - Poor Quality. Terrible design. As others have mentioned the cube sides (specifically the last one) doesn’t fit. I had to try and hammer it togethed. Poor design, clearly lacking in quality checks, and absolutely not worth the price"
70286645,Nifty accessory. This works beautifully in the Kallax. It is a lot more sturdy and natural looking when it’s installed in the unit. It looks like it was built that way — almost seamless so to speak.
40501892,Love. The legs are an excellent addition to the Kallax storage cube.
20275814,Excellent place for storage. Kallax is a great modern way to store our towels and use fabric drawers with different colors or cat patterns.
80275887,Good. Good
89278301,I love the product but. I love the product but you really should provide more extensive instructions for assembly. At the minimum you should consider some helpful do’s and don’ts. It’s not rocket science but stick figures don’t really suffice. Lol
40415192,"Sturdy shelf. We purchased two of these for our dining room since we are lacking storage here in Florida. They were easy for one person even to put together and took no time at all to assemble. I was surprised with the quality of the shelf, they turned out very nice!"
70301537,. Part of my walk in closet which turned out beautiful
90286649,Nice. Looks good and works well
20409936,Love it! A great wall filler.. Bought 2 units. They look great filling my wall. Still working on filling the space up in all the cubes. Have planned the stereo on top which is easily accessable by the adults and far enough from the young kids....  Easy enough to assemble and nice quality
80334603,"Would not recommend for vinyl storage with outer sleeves. I bought this based on other reviews stating they used this for vinyl storage. If you archive your vinyl in outer sleeves, then I would not recommend this unit. Bare vinyl covers just barely clear the opening and not all of my vinyl covers fit. I previously bought the 4 cube EKET and that works perfectly. About a 1/2 inch of clearance above vinyl covers giving plenty of extra room. I didn't have enough room for another 4 cube EKET, so I went for 2 single cubes and these do not have the same interior dimensions. I knew this going in, but since others were using it for vinyl, I figured I would be good. I'll make due with it because I need the extra storage, but if you have the space, definitely go for the 4 cube unit."
80401292,I love kallax. It’s my go to for organizing our space with style. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.
40275846,Perfect addition. Addition to the master bedroom for books and decorative pieces
60275812,"I love them. I have 3 of these plus 2 of the larger versions. They are far sturdier than people realize and ho with or can be coordinated with many decors...those who complain about putting it together? Well I've put all of my Ikea products including dressers together alone, they're either helpless or lazy, lol."
70301537,I love it. I am using it as a divider. Looks great and affordable.
40415601,"Good Shelves!. Aesthetically pleasing, sturdy, and functional - just right!"
10409932,Great room divider. I use this as a small room divider. I put my work space on one side and my vanity on the other. My only complaint is that it's a little wobbly.
60333954,Good Product. Filled our requirement perfectly.
80275887,very handy. it can store a lot of kitchen appliances.
50339292,For baby room. We purchased this for our new baby boy. We figured it would be a great part of making his room very boyish. It was easy to put together. No issues.
49336341,"EKET Shelf. I assembled four shelves and joined them together. The end product is functional and beautiful, but I had the most difficult time in the assembly process. The back board that slides into place was about an eighth of an inch too tall which made assembly impossible. I finally used an exacto knife and scored it on both sides to remove this extra height. Once I did that, it went together perfectly. It seems the back board was not cut properly. Once I figured out what I had to do, I assembled the remaining EKETS easily. It was extremely frustrating that the piece was cut incorrectly."
70301542,"Nice shelves. Solid, nice-looking, relatively easy to assemble. I've got three of these units."
80275887,Great. Great
00275848,The only problem is that. The only problem is that you have very few checkout counters open. Worse us you staff at returns… there is just one counter open and your staff is inside even thou they see five people are waiting in line. Products are good but service is bad.
59278307,Perfect fit. The kallax shelf is perfect for the space I bought it for.
70301537,Love it!. Love it!
90286649,"Look nice, a little small. These were a little tricky to install, are a little smaller than I expected and they stick when opening/closing. Not sure if they're askew, or if they're just tight-fitting drawers."
70339291,Great storage option. This shelving unit is perfect for my basement. Attractive and sturdy.
00415599,"Beautiful shelving!. I purchased two of these shelving units. I use them for bookcases. I love the look. Easy to assemble, good looking, sturdy, and a great value!"
80401292,Great for wine bottles!. fits bottles of wine perfectly. Very sturdy.
80275887,"Sturdy. Easy to build, strong, no wobbling, versatile for vertical or horizontal use. Love it!"
20409936,Great look. Awesome addition to our living /family room as an add on divider
20275885,Works perfectly for my craft. Works perfectly for my craft room.
69329387,"Drawers would not a-line. I saw this cute floating desk at my hairdressers and thought I would get one too. It has two drawers one would close the other one would not close at all! We switched them out adjusted the rails it just wouldn’t work. So I kept the top drawer and we remove the rails from the second one. A total hassle.IKEA, you really need to make sure your products work before you sell them to the public."
70301537,Big kallax. We love our new kallax. We are using it as a room divider in the basement. So much storage! Very sturdy
49442676,"Love It!!!. This is set up in my Craft Room and is working perfectly for holding my papers and also hiding some things with the use of the Kallax Drawer & Cabinet Door inserts. I love that its off the ground, too. I wish they had the same leg system for the other Kallax units. I would buy it in a heartbeat!"
40275846,Very nice.. Very nice.
80275887,Relax with Kallax. That's what I do. The cube storage and Drona bins keep my treasures contain Strength and beauty always on display
20305745,Love it. Love it
20275814,Great for closet. It fits in my closet. Waiting for the taller 4 unit on stock. It really helps organize your closet. Waiting for the inserts to place my shoes next.
60333954,"Very difficult to assemble. The most difficult piece of Ikea furniture I've ever assembled. There are plastic pegs that are already affixed to the pieces, so it must be put together like a puzzle, and the pegs can break off. Bring back the allen wrench."
60510862,"Useful in every space.. IKEA’s little boxes, one called the EKET,  are strong, attractive in several colors, are great in every room, including the garage. They can be attached to each other to create various shapes, or be used simply alone or stacked."
40423719,Good use. Good use
80508504,Love these doors for my Kallax.. These doors are great. They really dress up my Kallax unit. I have received quite a few compliments about them. The only negative is the new price. They went from $12.99 (?) To $25.00. That's a huge increase.
00275848,I use my kallax for. I use my kallax for books and the second one I bought I use it for all my gym stuff
20278167,Difficult instructions. The instructions are difficult to understand. The door doesn’t close very well. Flimsy
40275846,Kallax. Have several of these. Work great for hidden storage.
10409932,Great!!!. Great!!!
40275846,Beautiful unit. I used these units to create a matching bed frame and side table. They're very sturdy and perfect for my needs.
20275885,Looks great and easy to assemble!. Love this shelf unit! I use mine horizontally as a bookcase and receive compliments regularly. Easy to assemble and it provides lots of storage.
00275848,"Looks good, hangs good. Not. Looks good, hangs good. Not especially stable when used vertically as display case"
60275812,for my son. My needed something to but his record player on and his records in works perfectly
60275812,Loved it. This piece was easy to put together. Love the size and sturdiness.
40415601,Kallax. Works perfect for our space and easy to put together.
60275812,"GREAT CRAFT ROOM FURNISHING!. HAVE USED THESE IN MY CRAFT ROOM, AND THEY ARE EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND HOLD SO MUCH. COLOR SELECTION IS GOOD AND EASY TO MOVE AROUND."
10305741,Working out great. Working out great
80401292,🤩. 🤩
00415599,"So nice!. This is perfect for storage and for decor. I used the bottom six shelves for storage and found the cutest bins for them. There are so many options on containers that fit in the Kallax. The quality is good, I love this product."
70301537,Perfect for storage. I love all kallax pieces. We got two of this size and they are perfect for my craft storage! Love it.
20275814,Love it 🥰. Love it 🥰
10305741,"Very easy to put together!. Beautiful glossy white reconstructed wood slabs. Directions suggested two people put this together, but one could very easily do it! I needed this to help me organize the stuff in my room and it works well."
10305741,Easy. Beautiful and easy to assemble. 😍😍
40275846,"Exactly what we needed. This shelf was easy to assemble and much lighter than I expected it to be. The accessories available to add drawers, totes, and other organization aids make it super functional as a music room shelf."
20409936,"Another great Ikea product. This Kallax works perfect for the area in need of organization. Easy to assemble & it looks great. The box was too heavy for us to take upstairs to assemble, so we just took the pieces out of the boxes & easily carried them upstairs to put together. Looks GREAT!"
60275812,Looks so much better. This looks so much better than the old bookcase we were using.
10275862,Great shelving. I love this shelving. It was simple to put together and is quite sturdy.
90286649,I love these drawers. Adding the drawers made the shelves more organized. I love the look it gives to the unit and it was so easy to put together.
00275848,Surprised how much I love it. This replaced my old Jonas file drawer on casters. I am beyond pleased!!
20409936,Attractive storage solution for small. Attractive storage solution for small living space
80275887,Love it!. Love this because it is very modular and sturdy. Works perfect as our TV stand.
70301537,Shelves & shelves & more shelves. Need shelves? This thing is all shelves
00275848,as expected. as expected
20275885,Great storage unit.. Great storage unit.
20275814,"Strong. Strong, sturdy, easy to build, looks good."
20275814,Easy. It’s not as heavy as the old Kallax. Instructions are easy to follow. It took no time to put one together. Love it.
79442694,"Kallax Shelves. I have really enjoyed the unit. BUT, I am disappointed that several of the inserts are not available to fit into it. The 4 shelf insert and the 1 shelf insert has been out at all locations near me for several months. I realize there are delays in shipments because of supplies, but just wanted to know when they will be available."
60275812,It is sturdy and easy. It is sturdy and easy to assemble.
80275887,Great Office Addition. I use Kallax on its side to create an L-shaped desk in my new office. It has worked great. Was very easy and quick to assemble.
60275812,You can use for storage. You can use for storage or a tv stand I brought two one for storage and one for a tv 📺 stand
70332124,Perfect - just what I. Perfect - just what I was looking for! Duel purpose...shelf and night stand!
70391038,"Great Bookcase, Great Value. Great Bookcase, Great Value"
70339291,"Good Quality. Pros: Quality pieces, looks great, fits large baskets for organization, comes in a box that is easy to transport compared to a lot of furniture  Cons: Difficult to put together (be sure to pay attention to the pictures and which side faces up - it didn’t highlight this in the very first step, and I ended up having to take it apart and put it back together because the holes needed to face a certain way so that it lined up in the end to put the final small decorative pieces under the shelves in the front), no predrilled holes in the wood (they provide screws with a point and say that you need a tool to start the hole along with screwdriver to put the screws in - I just used a drill, which worked great) and no markings to line up exactly where to drill into the wood to make sure that it stays centered nicely, very lightweight so you’ll likely have to anchor it to the wall even if you don’t intend to or it will probably be too unstable"
40423719,Great for craft rooms. Perfect for 12x12 craft paper storage. I do wish there was a version with more individual shelves.
60275812,"KALLAX 2X2. KALLAX IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT IKEA DOES REALLY WELL: INEXPENSIVE STORAGE THAT'S EASY TO ASSEMBLE, FUNCTIONAL, AND NICE LOOKING"
80275887,Great to storage toys and. Great to storage toys and books
90286649,I liked the look though. I liked the look though the instructions left a little to be desired. Makes a nice place to store my record cleaning material.
00501889,"KALLAX Base/Underframe. I love the KALLAX base that I purchased. It was extremely easy to put together and gave my KALLAX unit just the right height and lift off of the floor. After putting my KALLAX unit on top, they look like they were built together from the start. I only wish that I had purchased it along with my KALLAX unit."
70301537,"Elegant and Practical. This bookcase is attractive and useful in my home office space. I chose it because it’s unique design. I wanted a product that offered storage along with the capability of providing room division for my office. This item exceeded my expectations with an added bonus: it’s beautiful and eco-friendly. Even though there were several pieces to put together, I’m handy, so along with one other person we simply followed directions and had it done in two hours. I purchased the shelf with two rows of drawer storage. This was a great buy."
20275814,"Love the kallax. This is our 3rd kallax, needed a smaller one and this is perfect, love the ikea baskets in here."
70286645,Looks great!. We bought this for the kallax shelf and it turned out wonderful. We are planning on buying another entire unit in the future.
70301537,Just as expected. Takes a. Just as expected. Takes a large space to assemble.
90286649,"Nice look at an attractive. Nice look at an attractive price. Appreciate the flexibility of arrangements with the shelves, desktop and accessories."
20275885,Great Piece. Assembled quickly by myself. Very sturdy and well made pieces. Price was reasonable and I expect it to last a lifetime.
40275846,"GOOD PRODUCT. I bought 3 of these to put around my desk as 2 shelves on the side and one across both of those, made a cute little cubby, had to buy my own brackets to mount them together so they didn't fall but well worth it."
70301542,The best shelf’s by far. I absolutely love my new KALLEX Book Shelf!! Going to get a second one and a smaller one for my other room. They are perfect for storing your records and of course your books lol. I definitely recommend getting one or if you need get two like I am.  You will love them to!
99017445,"Versatile, sturdy piece. These products are very versatile, flexible, and sturdy. Easy enough to assemble, and the possible modifications are endless."
10275862,Love all the matching pieces too!I had already purchased a four cute bookcase and a TV stand so this matching piece fills a blank wall that I had perfectly. It’s very functional and attractive.. I had already purchased a four cube bookcase and a TV stand so this matching piece fills a blank wall that I had perfectly. It’s very functional and attractive.
20275814,"Kallax is is in every room in my house. I use them for clothes storage, books, for dishes, as seating areas and I use them for storage in my classroom...they are the best!"
70286645,"DRAWERS FOR KALLAX. Not as easy to assemble, and the fit can be a bit off, but for the money not bad. Smaller in size but they look nice."
20278167,Stylish and simple. Very simple and easy to install.
60275812,"Nice enough. Works for what i needed. Like most Ikea products that need assembled, poor directions, cheap screws, and hardware."
50305739,"Great cubby. Overall I'm happy with my kallax purchase. A few issues I wasn't too thrilled with: charging an extra $10 for the gloss colorway is ridiculous, the sides of the unit do not match up flush with the top & bottom edges, and leaving the screw ends exposed makes the unit feel unfinished.  It's sturdy enough, and easy to move if necessary with plenty of available customization options."
20275814,So versatile and so easy. So versatile and so easy to assemble. If you’re not completely sure where it should of in your place that is okay. It’s easy to move. There’s accessories for it so it can be repurposed easily. And it’s affordable and good quality.
60275812,It’s a good product. It’s a good product
00275848,Used in the closet. Used in the closet
30275861,"Suits it's purpose. Looks good. Suits it's purpose. Looks good and was easy to assemble. We have similar storage cubes from Sam's club, but these were MUCH easier to assemble, and came in the size we wanted."
80275887,Love it great product!. I love this! I have two and they are perfect for about any room I. Your home. They are very sturdy.
80275887,Kallax Bookcase/Credenza. I’m so happy with this purchase! It was easy to assemble and fits perfectly in my home!
80275887,"All-around amazing.. So versatile, so easy to assemble, such a good piece for your home. If you’re thinking about it, just buy it. Ikea quality is always great."

60333954,It's good and practical. I. It's good and practical.  I used for my closet
20409936,Records galore? Look no further. This shelf I bought to store my records and it’s doing it’s job.
30275861,Love This Bookcase. I use this bookcase for yarn storage. It is sturdy and well made. I LOVE it!
50339292,Just as expected. Just as expected
00275848,Excellent. Would purchase again
80275887,"As usual, great IKEA product. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that the instructions said I needed a hammer. You really need a rubber mallet and NOT a hammer.  A hammer would have damaged the product.  Also, the package did not include the stickers to cover the exposed screws.  This is very annoying because you have to make another trip to IKEA just to get those."
00275848,Very useful. Very useful
70301537,Push together. We luv the unit. Bought for my daughter who has the 16 cube unit that we soon realized needed the 25 cube unit. It fits well in her room. The only thing I say is that these units need to come with a rubber mallet because it’s some what hard to push the wood pins together n u don’t want to use a hammer because it can leave dents.
79442694,"Very good product for value. This is a great product for storage. I got the feet, too, and it elevates it. I'm not going to lie, it's a challenge to put together yourself and some of the pegs really need tapping in or you cannot get it together, but overall super value for the price. It does organize the heck out of my craft room."
20275814,Works great. Looks great and easy to put together. Price is good and makes my art room look nice.
20275885,Bookcase. Love it. It works great for displaying my completed Legos. And added lights to it as well.
30275861,nice. nice
20275885,Awful. Awful
20275885,Nice. Nice
00275848,"Nice finish, but .... installation issues.... Easy to assemble and nicely finished, the shelf's design suffers from its inability to sit flush against a wall because of the baseboard. Without hiring an expensive cabinet maker, the shelf just floats. And the wall hooks are simply inane. I bought four which I will keep because returning is a nightmare. I still have product in my garage from a 9/26 delivery not picked up."
60275812,Exactly what we needed for. Exactly what we needed for the available space we had.
70301542,Storage AND a room divider . . .. I live in a 1-bedroom apartment. So I used the Kallax unit as storage and divide the bedroom into sleeping area and an office area. Works great !!  But I must leave a few cubes empty. So my Kittty can traverse to my bed.
40501892,Upgrade to a more elegant looking kallax. Love it. Simply adding these legs gives the kallax a much nicer look.
70301537,Love my Kallax. Other than the weight of the shelves (I got the 5x5 so it’s 6’ x 6’) it was a breeze to assemble. I’m very happy with it.
49294529,"Nice display shelves. My daughters Funko Pops needed a place to live so we found these shelves in store. They are easy to put together, except for the bottom and top shelves. They are not predrilled, so it is difficult to get the screws in."
10409932,Great variety of styles and sizes.Sturdy design. I have now purchased 4 units over the last 2 years.Awesome product !
70301537,"Wonderful Storage Option. I love Kallax! I purchased this to organize my craft and sewing room, and it's perfect! Set up was easy and much faster than I expected."
10305741,Ideal for Quick and Easy Storage. The Gloss White Kallax system is perfect in a number of configurations for storage in my modern home. The loft lifestyle come with very little storage solutions. IKEA has made shirt work of those concerns
40275846,"Great Compact Size. Bought this for the end of a closet, to make use of wasted space. Holds books and other miscellaneous items that took up space in the main part of the bedroom, and doesn't take up too much space while doing so. Sturdy and easy to assemble."
30275861,"Kallax. I bought two different Kallax units, one for my closet and larger one against the wall. Easy to put together and now able to be more organized."
10409932,Kallax. Love it
60275812,Loved how this product turned. Loved how this product turned out.
10409932,We love our storage!. We love our storage!
29278304,Worth the wait!@. Out of stock for a long time. I decided to wait and I am happy I did. Love it!
20409936,"Beautiful. Looks great and easy to assemble, even if you're alone. I love that it's wide enough to place two rows of books in it. Mine is placed sideways, so I can display and access my books on both sides."
10275862,Kallax cube shelving. I love this type of shelving. It is helping me keep my craft room organized
80401292,"Just what we needed for our everyday wine. We needed something to store our everyday wines, so we had more room in our temp controlled storage for other wines. We already had a Kallax bookcase (3 actually), so this was the perfect solution to store 9 bottles of our everyday selection outside of the wine frig."
20275885,Love the first one so. Love the first one so I purchased a second one for another room.
69190936,Great Addition!!. Great looking piece!! Took my time assembling due to not wanting to destroy any pieces. Would recommend!!
20409936,Very good storage unit. Very good storage unit
10305741,A work horse of organization. We have a lot of Kallax pieces…from office to closet they are so versatile and sturdy.
30275861,"The square beyond compare!. Let’s start with price: for the functional utility of this unit it can’t be beat. We already had the 12 square unit, which I used for stacking t-shirts and clothing and quickly outgrew. An upgrade to the 16 square unit was a no-brainer and has allowed me much needed storage space that would have otherwise clinically classified my t-shirt buying hobby as hoarding. Truth be told, my wife was sick of me stacking shirts around the room, on the top of dressers and night stands, that something had to give. To say I really needed this item is an understatement. As with most IKEA products there was a little assembly required that I initially dreaded since I didn’t help with the construction of the 12 square unit and therefore didn’t know what to expect. With a little guidance and temperance from my wife, we had it put together in less than an hour."
80487813,Easy to put together and is study. Didn't take too long to put together. Instructions were easy to follow. Boxes were a bit heavy and akward.
20275814,"Sturdy, sleak, and stylish. This. Sturdy, sleak, and stylish. This is a great buy and provided great storage in my house."
10409932,"Perfect For Our Closet. We purchased this for our guest bedroom/Office closet. It was easy enough to put together, especially after viewing a YouTube tutorial. I managed that task alone in fact. The quality is great for what we’ll be needing it for, which is to store office supplies, craft supplies, etc. We purchased a few of the baskets that slide in to the squares, along with one divider for reams of paper. We are very happy with the end result, and highly recommend this product."

20275885,Versatile….. Love Kallax. This made the 7th or 8th that we’ve purchased. Great for storage. We use them in most closets.
70286645,Great drawers!. Very easy to install. Very sturdy for the size. great for storing small electronics or other small items
10409932,"Sleek organizer. I needed to consolidate two pieces of old furniture into one and went with the Kallax. I already had one unit in my craft room for yarn. This one would house knitting projects, DVDs and miscellaneous items in the room I spent evenings watching TV while knitting. Love how comfortable the room looks now. The only drawback is waiting for one of the boxes for it to come back in stock."
60275812,"Love these shelves, they're great. Love these shelves, they're great for separating my books by series or collection"
59278307,Functional. Bought to use as temporary storage in bathroom.
70301537,"For the price, I had hoped for better.. We bought the Kallax, plus some drawers and doors. After carefully putting it all together, one of the drawers catches on some mechanism when you pull it out and the doors don't hang perfectly. Just looking at it all put together, it seems nice enough, but when you go to actually use it, the experience is lackluster. For nearly $800 US for the entire configuration, we had hoped for higher quality."
70301542,"Great looking shelving unit! The. Great looking shelving unit! The instructions are pretty easy to follow, but there must be an easier way... All in all I'm very happy with the results."

40501892,Excellent for my Kallax book. Excellent for my Kallax book shelf
70301537,"Sturdy, good looking.. I did not think I would ever get one but, hey, you can't argue with good design. With the blue Drona baskets and some white Donjons (sp?) it looks fantastic and is an excellent storage system. I am trying to bust clutter."
10305741,"Love our Kallax. Great and versatile storage in my grandchildrens room. It fits perfectly on our IKEA tv console, making for the ideal solution to overflowing toy boxes. We will eventually add some drawer and door inserts."
30275861,Kallax Unit is perfect. I bough a large Kallax and it is perfect for storage in my closet under the stairs.
20275814,"Kallax are very versatile!. We made a plywood base with 6 wheels, I put 4 Kallax cubes on it, topped it off with maple plywood (added a nice edging on the plywood) and made a huge crafting/cutting table. That made the cubbies 30” deep, I can get to them from both sides and they hold a lot of supplies!"
40423719,🤩. 🤩
59442666,"Great unit, looks fantastic.. Purchased this to finish off a bedroom with some clean looking storage. Bought the blue boxes to go in it - holds sheets and blankets perfectly and looks great."
80401292,Very sturdy when inserted in. Very sturdy when inserted in the cube. Exactly what I needed.
00388633,I thought the shelving unit. I thought the shelving unit was I wanted and I thought it was a quality unit and at a great price.
70301537,"Love my Kallax system. I love this Kallax piece. This is what has sold me on IKEA furniture. I placed it in my craft room and had it full in no time. I love that I can group my craft items by section. So, all the scrapbooking materials are grouped together. My puzzles are another group. Painting supplies are together. I have tried to organize before with other organizing units, and it just didn't work. Things were cheaply made and hid my items. With this unit, I am able to see what I have and keep things organized. This is a sturdy system.  I was worried that the shelves would not hold the weight of my items. A year in and all is well. I also love that I can add more Kallax organizers to this unit for my expanding craft supplies. In fact, I purchased a 12 cube to go beside it. Finally, I can't forget to mention all the accessories to go in the cubes. The drawers, shelves, bottle holder. I am able to customize so it works for me. I kick myself that I didn't buy this sooner and save money."
00334536,Best Purchase Ever!. I bought this bookcase because I wanted something to match my Alex desk and the gray Alex drawers were no longer available I am so happy I purchased it because it matches perfectly and it’s so handy I love it
20305745,Kallax yarn display shelving. Looks GREAT!
80487813,I'm waiting for this!. I bought 2 of the smaller shelve stands of this and I love them. It was quite easy to assemble now I'm just waiting for this! I'm using them in the classroom and it looks so beautiful and enough space for all the things I may need.
70301537,Plenty of storage!. Plenty of storage!
40423719,Kallax Inserts. Waited a long time for these to be in stock and well worth the wait as well as the 2.5 hours drive to get them. Sturdy once they are in the cubes and working as I expect for what I need them for with my scraproom. Very satisfied customer.
80334603,"Worked well for a weird place. We bought four teal ones of these and painted the back panels the same off-white as our walls, then we hung them so they were spaced about an inch apart (this was because we thought that hanging them to be right next to each other would easily have little gaps between them and look off). This is all a safe distance over a baseboard heater where we couldn't put a normal bookcase. Then I finished a piece of pine craft wood and put it across the top of the whole thing, which just gives us a nice flat surface for lamp, pictures, what not. Books go inside the boxes. It looks really good and works perfectly."
20275814,Better instructions for assembling. The instructions are difficult to follow because didn’t indicate what littler parts use and every single hole.
80275887,Perfect for my walking closet. My WIC was just a big mess. I got one of this and some boxes and the change is bigger than I expected. Easy to assemble and you can have different combinations or place it vertical or horizontal. Love the look of my closet.
40423719,"Easy to put together, nice. Easy to put together, nice way to organize all my craft papers!"
20275885,The Reigning Champion of Storage. We have Kallax units of varying sizes throughout our house and love the flexibility the bring to storage. Our 2 by 4 units in black/brown flank our Brimnes TV stand a bookcases to create a wall of storage options in our living room. When the holidays roll around the light material the Kallax units are made of lets us easily move them to the garage while our holiday decorations are up. What more could you ask for if it looks great and is highly functional?
70339291,Great!. Excellent choice! very sturdy and it looks fantastic with my other furniture. It's not very easy to assembly but it's worth it.
60275812,"Beautiful!. This cube storage is great! it has nice thick panels and looks very high end! And to top it off? Its very lightweight! I have cube storage from other companies, and they look and feel cheap. NOT this one! Very glad I made this purchase!!"
70301542,Absolutely LOVE this unit!. This unit is amazing! It fits perfectly on my craft room wall and enables me to organize all my tools and supplies.
50339292,"Love it !. I brought this product in early June of this year. I brought some bins to use as storage, I also use it to put my 40in Samsung tv on. The quality is great! The only down was that it didn't state the you would probably need a power drill to fully secure everything. Also I did like the fact that there wasn't a backing, but it didn't matter too much because I just ended up purchasing some bins that made storaging more organize. Also for the value you can't beat it !"
29278304,Excellent storage solution.. Excellent storage solution.
99017186,Great addition to our walk in closet. We looked at other organizers in other stores and this one is by far better quality. It’s a great addition to our walk in closet. Just waiting to be able to get the drawer inserts
80275887,"Purchased three of these. I use two standing up and one on it’s side, easy to assemble, sturdy"
80275887,Sturdy and super versatile.. i love it it looks so good in my sons nursery.
70483274,"It’s great, I wish I. It’s great, I wish I had seen the one with the drawers first however!!"

10305802,"Absolutely LOVE this shelf unit!. This is a perfect addition to my small office. I appreciate the simple design (white)....has a modern look, pretty spacious and my cute binders/organizers really give it a pop of color! I'm thinking of getting another one to go under the TV in my bedroom."
50305739,"Kallax Review. The kallax was easy to assemble, love the shiny finish, and quality is as expected."
80275887,"Solid Shelf!. I got this for my craft room and love it!! It solid, sturdy and very well made."

90286649,Returning. Worth it to go back and buy these
30275861,Best storage system for kids. Best storage system for kids bedrooms
20305745,No more dresser drawers. Kallax is perfect for our dresser drawer needs. Using a 5x5 for myself and a 3x4 for my husband. We prefer the deep baskets to shallow drawers. I use the door inserts for sweaters and my husband prefers open shelf for his many jeans. So many options.
40275846,"Great purchase. perfect match to other furniture, fits well and it is nice and sturdy."
10409932,"Shelf. I just love this, might have to buy more"
70342199,. Easy to assemble...good looking and value shelf to create extra space in the kitchen/dinning room area.
40501892,FINALLY. Finally a way to get Kallax off the floor. I hated the idea of having to screw into my shelves just to be able to sweep under them! Perfect solution.
70286645,Great fit. Looks great and very functional.
80275887,". This product was previously purchased and returned. Parts are missing and broken. I went through your process to obtain a shipping label, but I never received a return email from IKEA. Then, Covid happened and I couldn’t drive there to return it myself. I would really like this product replaced so I can set it up in my daughter’s room. I also live over an hour away and would prefer shipping rather than driving to return it due to gas costs and time."
20275814,"Great Quality. I really wanted the larger unit but they were out of stock. I bought 2 smaller units, at the suggestion of a REALLY thoughtful and knowledgeable employee and affixed them together and put them on a stand. I’m thrilled with the outcome!"
40415601,Perfect for Stereo equipment and albums!. Worked out exactly as we had hoped. Easy assembly and with a few added touches filled our need perfectly.
20275885,Excellent vinyl rack. Easy to assemble and spacious
20275814,"Perfect for closet and garage organizing.. A small closet with soaps, toothbrushes, etc was in need or organizing and I ended up assembling the cubes in the closet. Perfect results."
70342199,"Perfect for front door threshold landing. I wanted something for the ""entry way"" to the house which is also midway down the stairs to the lower level. Mostly wanted to display our special rocks and have a place for shoes/clogs on the bottom shelf. I also needed to be able to reach behind to the light switch. With a small decorative string of lights, this was the perfect unit to accomplish it all!"
90286649,"These shelves and the drawers. These shelves and the drawers work well in an office space, they have held up for well over 5 years."
10345073,Hawt and useful. High on looks at low price. Very useful for adding storage.
80334603,"Awful. I ordered this the other day and it arrived promptly just now -- went to put it together and it broke irreparably before I could even get it together. I was planning to use it as a small stand for a tall floor plant, to raise it a bit, and also store a watering can and some supplies -- I was going to order a more expensive pedestal table from West Elm and opted for the inexpensive IKEA hack instead. I'm very sorry I did and will now be ordering from West Elm. $20 down the drain -- don't waste your time or money."
20275814,We really like this product. We really like this product and have now purchased 4 of them.
40346924,"Sturdy. Easy to put togehter.. After buying one Kallax shelf unit, we went back and bought 5 more and will probably add another. We use them throughout the house - from the girls' play area to the office. They are great units."
00275848,Love it!. Love it!
00275848,"Great shelf, Can be horizontal. Great shelf, Can be horizontal or vertical, or hung on a wall."
70301542,We love these shelving units.. We love these shelving units. Bought our first one over 12 years ago. Now we have several and couldn’t be happier with the quality.
89294532,Great item. Great item
20275814,"Great Shelves!. Love these shelves! They are easy to put together, and look great!"
80275887,Exactly what was need. This piece was the perfect fit for my Grandfathers space. I purchased the baskets for closed storage and put labels on the front to keep everything organized for the caretakers.
40415192,. This was a great purchase it fit perfect in a small space without being obtrusive lots of storage and easy to assemble
30275861,Love it. We love the Kallax system. This one is being used as a bookshelf next to one just like it. So simple and classic.
20275885,Answer to my new years resolution.. Easy to.assemble. roomy. Would buy again.
89307643,"Will not fit records or record player. I got this to use as a record box. The dimensions seemed like it would work. But I didn't mean to get the one with a door! I installed it anyway, because it was the first step of the instructions. But when I closed the door, the like, half-inch of space that the door takes up makes the box just barely too small for the records. It also will not fit my record player on top of it. Just don't install the door, I know. I have another unit that I will use to hold the records; it will not have doors."
10409932,Kallax. I love my Kallax. I used Task Rabbit to assemble and they were great.
50339292,"Looks Great, Assembly Could be Easier.... The piece looks great, but let me tell you, the assembly was complicated. You have to be really careful with alignment. May take some trial and error. The wood on this piece could also be a little higher quality."
80275887,Looks great!. I used this as a room divider in my apartment. Spacious and helps the rooms look put together and tidy. I’m a 51 yo woman and had it together on my own in about an hour with everything properly placed and tightened.
80275887,"Hacked the Use. Instead of purchasing a closet system, I used two of the Kallax units to rework a walk in closet. Standing, this particular configuration fits under the existing hanging clothes rack. I place a second Kallax on the other wall in a horizontal position. I can now hang cloths, neatly arrange folded sweaters and jeans, and have more room than ever before."
60275812,love!. MOunted this piece on my bedroom wall and I love it!
80275887,Home Office organization. Very sturdy and perfect for my home office. I purchased three of them and put them side by side. They look like built in cabinets for way less.
20275885,Great features. Such a good pair for the desk we bought and the size fits well in a small bedroom.
59278307,Worth it. The assembly was awkward with those planting aligners and the directions were a bit confusing. The screws bumped one about her when following the directions exactly. But common sense tells you to avoid this. Worth it. I love it.
00388633,Perfect. This product is perfect. The wood was of excellent quality. Love the color. The step-by-step instructions were so easy to follow. Can't say enough good about this product. Wish I had more spaces for additional ones.
40275846,. Easy to put together look nice and it sturdy
10409932,love it. so fat seemed like the easiest thing I've put together from ikea. very sturdy and durable.
00415599,Great Shelf - Want More Colors. My sister had bought the 4x4 cube shelf from the kallax series and I absolutely loved it and wanted to get one for myself but the 4x4 was too big for my apartment and so decided to go with the 3x3 which is the perfect size. I only wish that there were more color options for this product as I really wanted the walnut-grey effect option but decided to go with the birch. This shelf was very easy to put together and was very sturdy after assembly.
70339291,"Great addition to the living room. This is a great shelf, very sturdy and creates a nice divide between the living room and our dinner table. I can confidently place my small speakers and plants without worrying if I bump into it."
10275862,Sturdy and attractive piece. Sturdy and attractive piece
80275887,Holds a tremendous amount. I bought two Kallax units for the craft room I'm creating. Will likely add other pieces but wanted to see how much would fit in there first. Assembly was pretty easy
10345073,Great design. Makes extra space for my catalogs on my shelves. Love it! The design keeps it from sagging.
20275885,Multifunctional. I first bought one for my home office. It looked so nice and worked so well I got three more. Two for my bedroom and another for my office. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.
30275861,Cub storage. We used this to divide a teenager room to give each girl they’re own space it worked perfect looks great and enough for 2 boxes to be shared
50339292,"Very sturdy. Accidentally dropped it on the way home, didn’t even dent! No scratches!"
40501892,Perfect!!!. This stand is perfect for the Kallax Shelf. It adds a nice finished look to the overall decor.
10409932,Nice. Nice
60278170,I think the price is. I think the price is just a little too high $ 17 each and I needed sixteen $ 300 dollar just for doors along
40275846,"Storage for scrapbook supplies. This is ideal for my scrapbook supplies. Was able to assemble in 30 minutes or less. Mounted above Micke desk, thinking of purchasing - love the clean design."
60275812,. Unit worked as expected and matched previous units purchased.

80275887,Great. I am very happy with my purchase I want to decorate my house with everything from IKEA
70339291,perfect shelving unit. This is the perfect shelving unit for my space in a shotgun style apartment. I had in mind to look for a unit that was a combo of metal and wood and voila! I saw this on floor display with the New signage and was instantly sold. It's pretty straightforward and easy to build. It took about 2 hours because I was watching TV. :)
20275885,"Versatile, good-looking and inexpensive!. I've bought several of these in different configurations, love them all."
20409936,"Solid, easy to set up, looks great!. I purchased this for board game storage and it is just about perfect—sturdy, the sections are a great size, and and the whole unit looks great. The ease of setup was a wonderful bonus."
80275887,Great product!. Easy to assemble. Light weight but very sturdy.

20275814,Nothing. Nothing
60275812,. Easy to build and stores a lot. Looks good too! Love the height as well.
90428842,"Nice!. I bought three of these to make a small bookcase in the corner of my bedroom. They go together easily enough, but it is hard to get the last corner to meet. I eventually got it to work and it looks great."
40275846,"Great for vinyl records!. I bought a 2x4 unit specifically for storing records. I don't know that I could say enough good things about these! I can store a ton of records, box set, etc. with this and everything fits perfectly. I'm planning to get another/more! The design is nice and simple. I've had it over a year and not a single problem with wear, scratches, finish, etc."
00415599,It’s good quality and perfect. It’s good quality and perfect for what I needed.
30275861,"Good shelf. I miss the more sturdy feel of the expedit collection vs the newer kallax collection. This shelf feels more flimsy. It will work for its purpose of holding my daughters toys, but I don’t expect it to hold up for several years to come"
70301537,Love it for craft and. Love it for craft and sewing room organization - just wish there was a cube system with slightly larger cube dimensions to fit scrapbooking boxes - 15” would be perfection!
60333954,"Easy assembly if you pay attention to the side labeled # 1. I have assembled many IKEA items, this one almost did me in! You MUST be certain to have the side labeled with the # 1 in the correct position or you will be unable to assemble this item correctly. Once I figured that out, assembly was a snap."
50481172,I bought two. And put in both side of tv console

00275848,"Second answer to new years resolution. A little difficult to assemble, but not impossible."
70286645,Great Product. Great Product

30275861,good. good
00415599,"Perfect. We've recently moved into an incredibly small apartment. The kitchen hardly has any cupboard space at all and we were seriously lacking space for our food. The little ""pantry"" they gave us now holds our plastics and appliances. We didn't have any counter space for our microwave, toaster, or toaster oven. Not to mention the lack of space for our dry goods. We bought this and two of the 2x6 kallax shelves to put on either side of it. Now we have all the room we need, plus the top of this for our three appliances we use often. It has plenty of space for stacking cans and keeping cereal boxes. We love our shelves."
40415601,"Team Kallax for Life. If I could build a house from these, I would."

70339291,Looks amazing!. Bought for storage in basement and looks great! Just what we needed for a modern industrial remodel. Already purchased another one.
10409932,Love it!. The Kallax is the very best organizing unit ever!

20275885,Toy storage. This has worked very well for storage of my little one's toys.
50339292,Great for teen’s room. We initially purchased the matching desk for our middle school son because the desk is nice and narrow. We liked it so much we decided to purchase this bookshelf because our son loves displaying his Lego creations so this was perfect for that and yet since have some “hidden” storage. And it looks masculine for a young teen turning into an adult.
60275812,"Awesome, WORKS AS I NEEDED. Awesome, WORKS AS I NEEDED"

20275885,Versatile and good looking. Placed one on its long side behind the sofa and it makes a great console table with storage.
10305741,"Very solid. Very solid piece. Hearty, solid, and I think the wall-anchors are really well done. They are pretty heavy-duty and well concealed. We put one in our daughters room (sideways) as a bookcase, and will likely add at least one more to another room."
70339291,Nice looking shelf. Assembly was easy and the shelf looks good. Definitly looks more expensive than it was.
30275861,. This was our second time purchasing this item. We had one for our daughter and it worked so well with organizing we bought one for our son as well.
00275848,Great product!. I bought this a few weeks ago to help organize my youngest room and I LOVE IT! Each square is big enough for each large basket

00415599,Kallax Shelf Unit. This shelf unit is sturdy and able to hold lots of books without the worry of the shelves bowing. It has clean lines and fits in with my white sewing furniture. Went together very quickly. Very pleased with my purchase.
10275862,"Perfect for wall unit. Matched up with 3X3 Kallax.. Again worked out great for our needs. Matched up with our other Kallax unit, makes a full wall of storage and a nice addition to the decor in the room."
70339291,Great Shelves. Went together easy. Could not be anymore pleased.
20409936,Perfect for my needs. Set up in my craft area. Each cube holds two 16qt latch bins. Sorting all materials to have at an arms reach.
10409932,"Excellent, as always. The Kallax system is one of my favorites. I have bought and used several different sizes, and they all have held up well, even during moves. They are easy to list together, and look neat when completed."
20275885,"Useful in closet.. I bought this for my 22 year old daughter who needed shelving under her hanging rod in her open closet. She put it together herself, easily and set it horizontally under the hanging clothes. It holds bunches of stuff and looks great!"

00275848,Great storage. Easy to assemble. Fit perfectly under my windows and provides tons of storage . Bought cubes to contain and hide the toys. Used horizontally. Bought a second on for my laundry closet. Stacked the washer and dryer and the shelf provides vertical storage. Love these!
80275887,Easy to put together and serves its purpose. Well done for a bookcase without a back to it
80275887,Excellent. Yes.... It is very Ive andas usefull.
30275861,Great quality and easy to assemble!. Product was exactly what I was looking for!
20275814,"Practical Quality. This is my third KALLAX unit. I bought my first one in 1990, and I plan to buy more."
00275848,"Right sized!. I bought this shelf unit when I moved to a smaller place without built ins. It works well for pictures, knic knacks and my battery charging station. the plates that screw into the wall help make this an exceptional item."
20275885,. Its exactly what I needed. And it works great.
89294532,Looks great for the price!. Looks great for the price!
10275862,"Kallai 4 x 4 Shelf unit. I recently relocated and was looking for a new way to store and display my vinyl record collection, this was the perfect solution. Large enough to accommodate all of my LP’s and still leaves room for me to grow the collection. Plus with the drawers on the bottom storage space for all the items you want at your fingertips but don’t want to see."
80275887,"Love this Shelf!. I love this shelf, it was easy to put together, great quality, it was perfect for the space I needed it in."
70342199,Sturdy shelving. Looks great and has the industrial look desired. Well made about an hour to assemble
20275814,Great Storage Shelf. I bought this to store my boxes of misc bedroom stuff. It works perfectly for storage and can be mounted on the wall if need be
10275862,"KALLAX Black. I bought these item several years ago, since then I bought four times now again because it is sound and strong for book shelf. I am totally happy"
70339291,Stylish. Very nice looking shelf and easy assembly.
60275812,"Bad Quality and Service. Really, had to do this review thing twice. It's ridiculous!Got the same unit before and noticed the material has degraded so much during installation. Boards were easily scratched and bent, parts not fitting, and wood sticks broken in process!!! It was a miracle to get this thing assembled. It's a sign to stop shopping at IKEA. Hope I can give this negative rating too!"
80275887,"GOOD MATERIAL. I BOUGHT THIS PIECE FEW WEEKS AGO, I LOVE IT, I AM PLANNING TO GET ANOTHER ONE FOR MY DAUGHTERS ROOM. I USE IT AS A DRESSER."
70286645,Clever design. Adds a functional draw to the Kallax. Ingenious design and clever installation instructions.
60275812,"Perfect. This went together well. It took a slow-paced hour. Follow the diagrams and get a nice-looking case. My albums fit perfectly, as well as my speakers in 2 of the cubes with the turntable on the glass top. Love it."
80275887,"Love it. We bought 2 of them for our office.  We modified them by adding stained wood to the outsides of them, but even without the additional modifications we did on our own, they are very sturdy and heavy duty. We purchased the extra drawers, doors, and casters and are very happy with how it provides stylish storage. They are going to last for a long time-they are not the cheap type of cubby systems that you get at a discount store that don’t hold up. We are very pleased."
50305739,Amazing Modern Storage. I bought this last month to go next to a longer Kallax I’ve had for over a decade. Was able to put it together easily and the glass top adds more picture storage without putting holes in my walls. Love it.
50339292,Great bar. It was easy to build and has gotten so many compliments
20275885,"Not recommended.. I own many Ikea products, and I am delighted with most of them. This particular item seems to be of lower quality than I have experienced with other Ikea pieces. The parts didn't line up as well as I have experienced in the past with other items. The worst part is the chemical smell. It smells like burning plastic. My throat was pretty irritated after assembling, but I figured that the smell would dissipate after a little while. Well, it's been two days, and I just finished moving both Kallax units to the backyard to get the smell out of the house. Hopefully, they will off-gas enough outdoors for me to bring them back inside. Otherwise, I will be returning these shelves."
80275887,Perfect !. It is perfect for what was intended. Multiple units are stacked against a wall in MBR closet. Each cube will hold 2 shoe boxes. My OCD-self is in shoe-heaven!
10275862,"Perfect size. Great, spacious and sturdy."
40275846,"Good product. I brought this product for few moths, and I love all product of KALLAX."
60275812,. The product is great for my office
50339292,Perfect for my space!. So happy with this purchase. I was shopping for a sideboard for my dining but nothing fit the bill...until I saw this. Two units together make the perfect addition to my space. I love how it looks. Very easy to assemble and the quality is very nice.
20275814,Light Weight And Sturdy!. The piece was easy to assemble and reasonable priced.
20275885,Kallax Shelf Unit. Easy to put together and looks nice with the cloth box inserts.
70301537,Make sure you have help move it.. I like my unit but without help to move it it is impossible by yourself. Maybe in the future could be designed to be in sections. Then attached together. It accomplished all my storage needs. I would buy again.
80275887,Sturdy and classic. Sturdy and classic
10305741,. Everything I buy from ikea is good! I have a great handyman also at my husband!! But in general very good!
70301537,"Poor installation instructions.. First, do not use a claw hammer as illustrated in the installation guide. Use a rubber mallet will help protect the wooden pegs and edges of the shelves (when you have to tap the ends with 4 pegs. Horizontal shelves do not slide in like the illustration.  You have to tap hard to get them flush.  Second major problem is that there 3 different width to the interior shelves, and vertical and horizontal perimeter pieces. This makes it difficult to align the pegs with the holes when everything is laying flat (as recommended by the installation guide). You have to lift certain pieces off the floor by about 1/8 in order to match the holes with the pegs. Probably not so bad with smaller units such as 2 x 4, but it gets very heavy try to lift the pieces when you are almost done with the 5 x 5 unit. A word of caution. Once assembled the 5 x 5 unit, it is nearly impossible to move the unit because it is so darn heavy.  You literally have to dissemble everything if you were to move the unit to another location. There is no shear panel, so the unit will flex if you attempt to move it too far. Probably a better idea is two smaller units rather than one large unit such as the 5 x 5,"
99017186,"Just what we needed for a tiny bedroom. A beach house we manage has a tiny master bedroom, in which a huge old dresser occupied most of the floor space AND blocked the baseboard heater to boot. For about $200 we added three times as much usable storage space with the 8-section Kallax, adding doors and drawers to all 8 sections, and boosting it up off the floor and OVER the baseboard heater with Godmorgen feet. The room is so much more navigable, the heat now circulates freely, and there's room for a whole summer's worth of easily-accessible clothes. Took a little extra work, but it's a world of difference."
20275885,"Easy to assemble & Sturdy. I own a preschool and have purchased 7 Kallax units for my classrooms. I place them horizontal, and they're a great height for the children.  I've brought different colors (white, yellow, and pink- which is no longer made) over a year ago, and they still look like new. I just purchased black, awesome for the older children. Kallax are sturdy and good quality, and theseare wiped almost daily for cleaning. Good price, too."
20275885,It's what it is. I think the instructions could be better (use a mallet when tapping in dowels) still not a fan of particle board with easily removed vaneet but it's what I needed at a solid price.
20275885,". Love it for storage, easy to assemble!"
70301537,Great for organizing my crafts room!. I got this to help organize my crafts room and it worked out great! I would like to see more inserts with dividers (such as to organize cardstock sheets). The organizer that is only half the depth of the cube seems a waste of space. Would buy more inserts if they helped in organization.
20275814,Perfect for extra closet storage. Perfect for extra closet storage
30275861,"Works great!. Nice size, very sturdy, good price. Good, good,good,good."
70301542,"Nice Piece for lots of storage. I love this piece. I can hold a lot of stored items. I have had smaller version of this unit, this is the first large piece I have set up. This was a difficult piece to put together and it is not a one person job. Lifting the unit itself take two to three guys to lift. But I like it."
70301537,"great value, cheap material, difficult assembly. The price is good for this product. appearance and feature is great. A little bit disappointed is that it is not hardwood, but the price may hint this. Assembly is simple, but easily damage the horizontal wood piece due to hammering on the long end. Some difficulties to assembly the wood components without gaps, but manageable."
80275887,"Simple and sturdy. I’ve bought different combinations of the Kallax shelves over the last three years. I’ve used the sets of four to mount on the wall in my laundry room, the set of sixteen in my kids playroom and the three of the sets of eight in my basement. They all are easy to put together, sturdy, and look wonderful! I love these shelves!"
40415601,"Great for my son's huge spaceships. I bought this for our playroom because my son's spaceship fleet did not have a space station. I now have a place for the Millenium Falcon, the entire Miles from Tomorrowland fleet, and a smattering of semi large toys that took up a lot of playroom real estate."
20275885,"sturdy construction, looks great. love the purchase, works well for what I needed it for"
30275861,This has SO much storage. I LOVE my KALLAX!!. It was bigger than I anticipated but it looks really nice in my office/craft room and has so much storage. You definitely need 2 people to assemble it. I got it at a really great price do it was worth it!
10305741,"KALLAX Shelf unit. Slowly but surely we are getting rid of our old furniture and replace them with thies modern , excellent quality, affordable shelves. So much storage. It lightens up every room. And the choice to either have doors, drawers or boxes: genius. Altogether we have now 8 of these units."
99017445,Ok. Ok
80275887,Easy assembly!. I bought several of these in various sizes for my 3 granddaughters. They love them! Plenty of space to display all their things. Assembly was easy and came with everything you need. One thing I did was to glue each piece with wood glue as I assembled it to ensure years of use. Very happy with this unit!
40415601,Nice quality. Nice Quality and easy assembly.
59278307,Kallax the Best. I shopped at Ikea for the very first time in December 2019 and loved everyting i got. I upgraded my craftroom and needed some storage and the Kallax fit the bill perfectly.
80334603,"Great cabinet. Don't listen to the negative reviews. We bought 6 of these cabinets and had ZERO issues putting them together. They are great, and are really well made. you have to FOLLOW the instructions and you will be fine."
40415192,"Love it, great piece!!. Happy I purchased this furniture"
80275887,"Good but.... Directions indicate using a hammer to tap the shelves together. Unfortunately, any tapping WILL damage the finish/ crush some of the material that they're made from."
70301537,"Board split when putting it together. While this does feel a bit sturdy with weight on it, it wobbled a lot before adding things to the shelf. The wall brackets don't work due to the base boards (about an inch gap), so the entire shelf would have to be tilted to mount it to the wall. When we were putting it together, one of the holes on the board we had to put a peg in wasn't drilled/lined up properly, and a big chunk of the shelf came off. We glued it back on, and hope no one notices, because we don't have the HOURS it would take to stand in customer service waiting for a replacement board."
70301537,Great for craft room!. Very happy with this purchase for my craft room. Purchased a few doors & added them to keep a few things out of sight. Very sturdy.
40314640,"KALLAX Insert with door. We left some shelves open, some we closed with boxes, and some with doors. Perfect. My only recommendation would be to include larger screws. The ones included are a little bit short. We replaced them, but it would be a big improvement to have larger screws."
00314642,"Used to be better. This is the second set of drawers I have. The first I purchased were $20, matte finish, quality solid hardware, and slide nicely and fit perfectly in my Expedit. This set was more expensive at $25, only in shiny finish, and doesn't slide as nicely. There's a catch of some sort in the cheaper moving parts. I need them so will keep them, but disappointed in the decline in quality."
70286645,Super easy to assemble. Changed knobs looks great and added needed storage
30275861,Perfect for basement playroom. We love this for a basement office/playroom. It keeps things neat and the kids can stay organized.
70286645,"Great features, wish better price.. This help organizing the shelf and we love the product. However we would buy more if the price is much lower."
70301542,"Love this shelf, However.. I have this shelf in another color in my home, So I decided to purchase it again for the storage space. However, when putting it together the top boards were wrong and I could not secure it with the screws. So it is loose. I do not live close to IKEA and didn't want to take the drive. The return process takes hours and with a Toddler that is not ideal."
10409932,Great Shelf. We're very pleased with this shelf. It's sturdy and seems very durable.
10305741,Perfect for organizing. This is the 4th unit I'e bought!
60221683,". Fantastic and sturdy shelf! We love that it has a slim design, as it fits perfectly in our walk in closet."
00275848,. Excellent product. Great for what I wanted.
10275862,"nice, sturdy, good looking bookshelf. I needed to organize board games and my library and this was the go to recommendation by many people and I can see why. Assembly was easy enough, feels sturdy, good and heavy for durability even though its particle board. Was surprised at the weight so do be careful that you actually follow that 2 people should help lift the boxes."
20275814,What took me so long to purchase. Great store unit in my utility room. Easy to assemble and looks great. So versatile I went to Ikea and bought 2 more.
30275861,Great storage unit for my. Great storage unit for my craft room
60275812,Simple and functional. We needed a small shelving for or home office/guest room to keep files and supplies. This works perfectly. Size is just right. Easy assembly and you have the flexibility to either put doors or shelve drawers.
20278167,"Wow!. Who knew IKEA could be so creative with design. This is awesome, it hides some recipes that would otherwise be all over my kallex bookcase."
70301542,simple but good. This is my second product of Kallax unit. they are simple and easy to installed but work good as I expected.
00275848,Very practical. I have several size Kallax and love them all. My entire closet is now organized and I am in the proses of doing the luandryroom. I also just discovered the door insert and now I can conceal things behind a door yay! I will be buying more as I organize each room. Love Love Love them!
20409936,"Versatile, well-designed, sturdy. We bought two 4x4 Kallaxes for our family room to use a bookcases and grandchild toy storage. The variety of storage boxes makes the latter easy, and the 13” cubbies hold large books. Assembly was easy, but is best done with a helper. The components fit perfectly and securely. We considered alternative bookcases costing up to five times as much, but we doubt the others would be significantly better."
20275814,"KALLAX Shelf. I have a full wall in our garage with these shelves with doors and we store our extended collection of sants figurines during the rest of the year. Very sturdy, easy to assemble, good price. I love these units."
40415601,"Great for corner office or craft room.. Bought it 2 weeks ago had to go back and purchase 1 more its a bookshelf, desk, museum display.."
60275812,"My favorite square on this sphere. Perfect for records, kitchen cart for appliances i May or May not have splurged on during quarantine, and even a bookshelf nightstand. It’s become my staple does-it-all furniture."
00415599,"More storage less area. This 9 cube Kallax was easy to assemble and move. I was looking to have more storage for my kids room, and at a height that they could reach."
20213312,. Perfect in my living room
40415601,"just okay. I had the larger version in black for years and absolutely loved it, but the high gloss white leaves me feeling just meh... it's just laminate over particle board, which makes it somewhat difficult to assemble. Several of the shelves were dinged when I unpackaged, but not enough to return. I think the quality is just not as good as it was."
60278170,. Awesome! Loved the shelf!
20275814,Perfect!. This KALLAX is the perfect solution for me.
60221683,"Fit perfectly!. Fit great works well. Easy to,assemble. GREAT!!!!"
70301537,"So much storage for a great price. I've had this shelf up for 2 weeks now, and it looks fantastic. The assembly was not as smooth as other Ikea furniture I've put together, but I was able to do it with one other person without breaking any parts or getting injured. A lot of elbow grease is required. Also, I recommend using heavy duty snap toggle anchors if you're going to secure the shelf into drywall. The unit itself is crisp looking (though mine was dented on a side and I didn't notice until getting home) and quite versatile in terms of how you choose to dress it up. Very pleased with this unit."
10275862,Perfect!. Best storage EVER! It is simply the best. Go and buy this now if you need organized storage.
50214678,. Love it! Stylish and easy to assemble.
20275885,"Great addition to my bedroom. I had an empty area in my bedroom and this shelf fit perfectly. I use bins and to store items, use it as a bookshelf, and display other decorative items. It is easy to assemble and good for quality."
50339292,Storage Space. It's good and reliable.
49285817,"Perfect for my records. I bought three of these to hang on the wall in a custom arrangement to hold records. The pieces all snap together, but don't feel like they're going to fall apart (which is important since they're holding vinyl). Even with an extra hardware store run to get wall anchors, all three were assembled and hung on the wall in under 2 hours. I do have a few records that are in slightly taller gatefold cases or in their own box that were a tighter fit, but not unmanageable."
10275862,"Great Shelving Unit. I bought this for my son's room, to display his Lego sets in an organized fashion, and we love it!!! It was easy to assemble and the quality is fantastic. I'm really happy with my purchase."
80303437,Well made. And an excellent value. Helped to beautifully organize our kitchen.
50339292,Really nice look. Looks really nice once it’s all put together. The assembly instructions we’re just OK that is why the rating is a little lower. Product itself it’s very nice
00275848,Great unit!!. Used these along with Micke desk to create vanities for 3 granddaughters. They LOVE them! They were easy to assemble! I used wood glue to ensure years of use!
60275812,"Works great!. Bought this for our closet, works great, is sturdy and was easy to build. Fills the need of a little extra 'drawer' type storage with the cloth bins."
20409936,Perfect Size. This shelf is the perfect size for board games and the price was less then shelves at that mart place.
40275846,Very sturdy and flexible arrangement. Very sturdy and flexible arrangement options!
80275887,"Great price, better quality!. I bought this over a month ago and also purchased the available caster units. I roll around the storage where I see fit."
20275885,. It looks beautiful in my living toom
19278272,"Quality cube unit. I love these kallax cubes in all sizes. I have two of these in different colors and love them. They are sturdy, easy to assemble, and look good in a room. I just wish they would come back with the lighter, more natural wood color."
60275812,Nicely made. I like these units. But I miss the expedits. They were a bit bigger in mass. I hate when there is something that works well and then they change it ever so slightly. Is doesn't quite match up to what I already have.
40346924,"Perfect Colors!. I just remodel my kitchen with grey cabinets, so this shelf unit becomes my transition to my natural wood furniture in my family room. And my kids store their backpacks in them."
60221683,Love it. This looks amazing in my kitchen and it was so easy to put together
10409932,Great. Divides living area and bedroom area. I think I am living on Pinerest
00415599,"Fit perfectly. I have a small narrow sewing room and wanted to maximize my storage space. With about a 13 inch depth, this was exactly what I was looking for. I bought the storage bins and drawers (two draws fit in one cubicle) to complete the look!"
80275887,"Easily built, sturdy, and flexible use. I needed some extra storage space, and IKEA just happened to have a sale on for Kallax shelving. The second toughest part was probably deciding which one to get; the first was trying to move the superdense box (:D). But seriously, the different possible combinations of shelves (I almost got the 3x3 instead) and the treatments for the compartments (fabric or wicker baskets, drawers or cabinet doors, etc.?) makes them suitable for most any situation. I told my sister-in-law about the sale, and she drove down to pick up several. Whereas I needed the shelves for extra clothing in the bedroom, she wanted to improve her craft room storage. Putting my unit together wasn't too tough, and once stood up and filled still feels very strong."
39285827,"Assembly is quick and easy. Just wanted to make a review addressing all the one star reviews. This box is super simple to build. If you can slide pieces together, you can build this box. It does require some common building sense. Rubber mallet is helpful but not necessary, as you can just use your weight to get the pieces to slide together. I've bought 12 of these, and only had one issue where one of the plastic connectors on a panel was not fully driven in, few wacks of the rubber mallet took care of it."
80275887,Closet Storage. I use this shelf unit in my closet as a clothes organizer by laying it horizontal under the clothes I hang up. I works perfectly and looks great! I bought one just to make sure it would work and am now planning on purchasing two more.
90305803,Great looking. Used in the kitchen for microwave and coffee maker.
70339291,Nice shelving. Great item for the price. It’s midsize so check measurements to make sure it’s what you want ( looks larger in pictures). Great for decorative items. Metal frame is sturdy. Wood shelf inserts are thin but nice color.
50305739,Sleek look. Bought this for the guest bedroom. Very sturdy and neat finish.
89278259,Easy to assemble and economical. Overall I would give it a five except for one thing it seems that some of the wood is a little soft and in two areas screws broke through which should never have happened but I would definitely recommend this unit
70301542,Perfection!. I now have a yarn room where I can find what I am looking for. I am a knitter and had my yarn stash in bins. It was a nightmare looking for the yarn I wanted to use on my projects. Now I can see much of my yarn and most likely will buy another unit to put the rest of my yarn in on another wall.
60275812,Great product. I bought this to make a portable sign in cart for our church. We bought the casters and the drawer insert also. I have had many compliments on the cart and love it! Easy to put to together.
20275814,Great features. I bought this a month ago and again bought more a few weeks ago. I am so happy with the bright color and spaces. Easy to assemble the pieces that I can handle by myself.
40346924,"nice versatile shelving. I love this shelving unit. I chose to position it horizontally. It's nice to have that option! I also added few of the optional baskets to it, which gives it a finished look. It's a nice piece of furniture to add to any room where you need a little extra storage or want to display some books, art pieces, etc."
70301537,"Dream come true!. This Kallax 5x5 unit is like a dream come true! It went together seamlessly and fit perfectly into the space. The craft studio never looked better. The Kallax 5x5 has SO much storage too. With so many options available for the cubes, the possibilities are near limitless! I also got the drawers, cube like baskets, and other boxes for a perfect fit. Thanks!"
40415601,So versatile!. Bought this after owning smaller version.
80275887,Nice and sturdy. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.
30275861,Great cubes!. I bought these for my craft room and I love them. I bought these because I liked the laminate feel and seems like they are going to last longer than other sets from another store I have purchased. As my husband was putting them together he said the quality of the cubes was a lot better than the BHG ones I bought from a big box store. The fabric cubes that fit these are really nice too.
40415601,Great product.. This product is really sturdy and attractive. Easy assembly. Great value.
80401292,This is a great product.. This is a great product. It’s got a nice tight fit (almost to tight) so I’m not worried about it moving as I take things in and out of the cubbies.
30275861,"For all my storage. I use Kallax and various attachments for all the storage in my house. We have one as a TV stand, two as dressers, and another 5 as bookshelves, three with the desk extensions. I am sad that the birch option is no longer available."
30275861,. I bought at least 5 of these shelf units. They look great in every room.
50339292,"Great for home office. I bought this piece, along with the narrow three shelf tower and wide three shelf unit. I put them in my home office and they look great displaying a few collectibles and housing office supplies. I'm very happy with this purchase."
30275861,love my shelves. love my shelves
40415601,Love it. Absolutely love it. Its amazing
20275814,love them.. I bought 3 of these and made it a tv stand
70286645,"Surprisingly sturdy. Bought for use in our office with our Kallax. At first, we were leery of how well it would work when we saw it was not all wood, but after assembly and installation, we were pleasantly surprised with its sturdiness and quickly decided on purchasing a few more."
60275812,"Missing shelf divider. We love all of the other Kallax pieces we have bought, but this most recent one that we are being asked to review was missing a major piece of wood, not just a little piece of hardware. I haven't figured out how to request a new piece, and we had driven it five hours away to my daughter before we assembled it to know a piece was missing."
40346924,The add ons like drawers. I bought this to replace a larger unit and my drawers fit it. This was the perfect size for a smaller room
50339292,Modern and Industrial. Gives the look desired for the room. Do wish it had a back on the door section
00275848,Great craft storage!. I bought the Kallax for craft storage and I love it!
80275887,Great Cubes!. I bought these for my craft room and I love them. I bought these because I liked the laminate feel and seems like they are going to last longer than other sets from another store I have purchased. As my husband was putting them together he said the quality of the cubes was a lot better than the BHG ones I bought from a big box store. The fabric cubes that fit these are really nice too.
20275885,Works great in my space!. The box was in the middle of my living room for a week before I decided to put it together. I was able to do it by myself. It was easier than I thought and I love it! I’m using it under my wall mounted TV. I’m thinking about getting a couple of more to organize small appliances in my kitchen.
20275885,"Great Buy. We are currently using this as a media console/toy box. We have a small space and a 2 year old, so we wanted something fashionable and not take up a lot of room. We laid it out horizontally and added baskets to keep the toys in and it is working perfectly for us. Assembly was fairly easy and it took about an hour or so."
80275887,"Versatile and Practical. I purchased the 4 square and rectangle ones before and loved them. I still had space that needed attention. After pondering for 6 months, my eyes gravitated toward the 2-level Kallax Unit! It’s perfect!"
10305741,Great features. I bought this one month ago and I am so happy
00275848,bought this for my moms. bought this for my moms bathroom. It looks good and fits perfectly.
60221683,Adjustable and sturdy. Needed a sturdy shelving unit with lots of space. This is pretty and worked perfectly
80401292,Perfect for a some of my O-Gauge trains :). I just bought it to try if it works for my O-Gauge trains and I am crazy happy because a lot of them fit perfectly!!! I wish IKEA could make some plastic drawer inserts for this insert. It would work perfectly to organize my kids LEGOs :)
10409932,Love the clean lines and functionality!. Perfect for a Florida home remake!
20275885,". I've been wanting this for a couple of years but never had the space for it. Finally reorganized and was able to get it! I love it just as much as I thought I would. Simple instructions, sturdy, and clean look!"
00415599,"Look good. Not easy to put it together, can damage the surfaces of the unit."
60275812,Shelf unit. Looks great and was easy to put together. I actually came back and purchased a second one!
20275885,"Great For Vinyl Collectors. Needed something for the vinyl records I collected over the years that I was keeping in boxes around my apartment. This did the trick, with 13x13 shelving space, it's the perfect size for the records whether you set it up vertically or horizontally. Really easy to set up. I'm not the best assembler, even with IKEA furniture, but I had this unit ready within 30 minutes."
80275887,"Dissappointed. I put one of the units and was able to put it together myself. When I stood it up, I found one of the shelves was missing about 1/4” of The white edging was missing. IKEA was very helpful at replacing the part, however, now I have to disassemble and rebuild it. In the mean time, I had a tool with cushion feet on it. When I moved the tool, I found that some of the paint came off."
20275885,"Store Everything. Stacked 3 on their side in my laundry room and have dog food, cat food, pantry items, laundry products, etc. Everything is neat and easy to find. Love them. If I had small children would attach to the wall just in case someone tried to climb them."
70286645,"Closet organized!. The entire Kallax unit, drawers and baskets made my closet clean and easy to organize"
80303437,. I bought this shelf unit for my bathroom and I love it ...
30275861,Perfect fit.. I bought this unit for my craft room and absolutely love it.
60275812,Great features.. I brought this item about a month ago. I love the fact it was very easy to assemble. Very good for storage.
60278170,". I Love the inserts. Very easy to install, too."
60278170,"Cheap and flimsy. These look great, but the installation requires you to screw into the unit where there are no holes. This means that you cannot move the doors and drawers around within the unit once you have made your decision, as it leaves ugly screw marks behind. Also, if you make a mistake and dont screw perfectly straight, you have multiple holes which make the product even weaker. The door installed slightly askew, despite my following the directions very well (I have put together Lego Mindstorms, if that's any indication of my pictorial directions-following abilities). The other installed slightly too low so that it rubs against the lower end of the shelf every time you open or close it. I consider myself pretty good at putting these things together. I think it is just poor design and weak materials. I gave it two stars overall because it does look nice."
30275861,"Sturdy and functional. Extremely easy to assemble, great looking, and very sturdy!!! The only drawback was when we tried to add doors and drawers; they cannot be side-by-side due to the length of the screws. The shelves are not thick enough and the screws hit each other, keeping you from screwing them in correctly. We had to offset the doors and drawers or put them on top of each other. We used baskets for the other cubes."
80275887,"Great Shelf Unit!. I'm loving the KALLAX shelf unit! I'm using it on its side on my strong craft table and it has increased my storage space so much! I've been able to fill it with lots of my 12x12 designer papers, lots of printer paper, books, and also some pretty things I have in my craft area. It holds lots of stuff!"
00275848,Functional. Excellent for fitting inside a built in wardrobe. Quality a little lacking.
20275814,Perfect for my She Shed. I bought this to complete a long desk in my “She Shed”. They are perfect!! Easily assembled and fantastic quality!!!
40275846,Better price and useful. Better price and useful
20275885,Holds all of my records. I bought this item based upon multiple recommendations from various collector sites. I am an avid record collector and this is perfect to hold your albums. Each cube will hold between 50 and 60 records. easy to assemble and does not sad under the weight.
00314642,"Cheap and shallow. While these drawers looks nice, they are made of weak material that I fear may rot in humid weather. I took the advice of another post that said not to screw the sides into the unit. I had already screwed into it though, so the holes are there, but the drawers would not fit unless I removed those screws. I do not recommend this product. You get what you pay for, I suppose."
10275862,Wonderful. I love my purchase I will be back.
20275885,"Excellent for beautiful and handy storage.. We have at least twelve of these now: seven for vinyl LP’s’ three for bedroom clothes storage, and two for bookcases. They adapt so well to most anything and fit sideways or upright into many small places. For small kit homes and bungalows throughout the North and Midwest, they are so handy that real estate agents should leave IKEA brochures on the kitchen counters of the homes they show."
70342199,"great sturdy piece for smaller spaces. The assembly is a little tricker vs your average wooden IKEA shelving unit. Pay close attention to the orientation of the holes alongside the frames. Once put together it really elevated the look of my bedroom- this looks like shelving that other popular high end stores sell for hundreds of dollars.  Tips: It helps to not tighten all the screws all the way until the end- this makes all the screws easier to place without metal of the frame not quite lining up and blocking the way for the screws.  The bamboo top does NOT come with pre-drilled holes, but the wood is soft enough and the screws for that element are pointy enough that once you line it up properly with the frame (use painter's tape to hold it in place if needed) and use a firmer overpressure while placing the screws with a manual screwdriver, they will go in and catch the surrounding wood with no problems. I actually don't advise pre-drilling holes because if the holes are too large then the screws won't catch as securely."
70342199,". Looks great, I need another!"
50305739,"Sleek and simple. Easy to assemble, sturdy modern and has good storage."
70301542,I'm so happy with these cubbies!. I debated on buying the 4x4 vs 5x5 unit.... I'm so happy I bought the 5x5. Lots of storage and putting it together was easy.
00275848,BEST FURNITURE EVAH!!!. EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND GREAT FOR STORAGE - SLEEK AND STURDY
00415599,Bery helpful and looks nice too!. I am using this kallax in my studio. Love the additional storgae and abolity to display items.
70301542,"Super heavy - looks o.k. - generally happy. Generally happy with this purchase. It is largely held together with dowels and slip fit, so the vertical joints creep. Looks like I thought it would. openings are perfect."
20275814,"Good quality. Easy to assembly, good quality."
10305741,"Love it. Build was super easy, finished unit is sturdy and fits where we needed it to. Couldn’t be happier."
00415599,Love the 3x3 cubes. New offering from IKEA. Love the 3x3. I use it next to a 2x4 cubes configuration and it is very nice. I get to put bigger items on the top and can have room to hang pictures on top of the 3x3. Easy to install.
30275861,. Part of my walk in closet which turned out beautiful
80275887,EVERYTHING IS AWESOME. I bought this last month and it looks great in my craft room.
10275862,I have before this. I love this because we can choose how many shelves and shape( I mean small and big ) also they have many attachments ( most are sold out for my area) and stronger than billy !
20275885,Slightly disappointed. I bought two previously years ago. I decided I needed another. Put it together and put it next to my old one and see that it is about an inch shorter.  That is my only complaint.
70342199,Sturdy and handsome!. We had two of the longer shelving units we purchased a year ago.we purchased the smaller shelf when we re reconfigured our home office. It looks great and is very sturdy. It also provides holes attach to the wall for stability.
10345073,"Good usage. Since the day I purchase this, so far I’ve been satisfied."
20305745,". Wish they had extra pegs, broke two and wish pegs were made Of harder wood. Also one screw short for wall mount."
50339292,Sturdy but doors DO NOT ALIGN. Just bought this item assembled and doors do NOT align and one of the doors keeps swinging open.
60275812,"Perefect fit. Bought a bedroom tv stand and hit fits right in. With added storage for books,"
20275814,Just what I wanted. I bought three to organize some STUFF. They were on sale. Easy to assemble. Very strong. Looks good. Very happy I did it.
79285830,Love them. Just love them! Easy to set up and they looks great
80275887,. Like product. Worked great for the purpose I bough it for.
60278170,"I recommend the Kallax system. I recommend the Kallax system to friends, family, & strangers. With the drawers & doors, it makes a perfect dresser system."
60275812,"Love this unit!. I bought this to store my granddaughter's toys. With two storage bins, it works perfectly.  I can store books and games in the spaces without a bin and then the loose items in the bins. We are very happy with it."
80275887,"Five stars. Great value, sturdy, easy to put together. The instructions say to but it could be done with one person if necessary"
60333954,Sturdy and yes it's easy to put it together. I read the other reviews and I was expecting a painful installation but surprisingly it was easy to put it together. I just followed the instructions and it was easy to do.
70286645,"Practical. I purchased two, two drawer units and they were very simple to install. The overall look says clean and organized and they look great! The drawers hold quite a bit. I used mine for storing many misc cords, another for batteries and nightlights, another for small electronics, and I still have an empty one. A must-have for anyone who loves having their life organized!"
80303437,Not great. I bought this smaller unit and a larger unit to put together as shown many places. When placed next to eachother the units do not line up directly and looks awful. I threw away boxes so I can not return. I listed them on Craigslist for half of what I paid plus assembled and have not had any responses. VERY DISAPPOINTED!
50305739,"Perfect size. I bought this to organize my nursery closet. It was easy to assemble, <30 minutes! And the size is perfect for my closet. The price was much better than similar items at other stores."
40275846,wonderful vinyl storage!. Boughtthis to store my vinyl collection. It is perfect!
40303439,Will look great in any home. One of my favorite Ikea purchases yet! It's very sturdy and looks elegant. The only trouble you may run into during assembly is the weight of the pieces.
50339292,. Love it !!! Its great !!!!
70301537,"Great Shelving for Purses!. I purchased this unit to store my handbags in my closet room and it is fabulous! Holds all of my purses, all shapes and sizes, and I love it. I also got the 4x4 unit as well."
00275848,Great laundry room holder for towels and swim suit. We decided to upgrade the laundry room organization. We put this unit in with three bins for assorted swim wear and one open bin for pool towels. We anchored it to the wall and it has worked out great.
20275814,Easy. Very sturdy and is perfect to  put a TV on. Bins keep everythinh organized.
80303437,Nice finish. Strong and easy to assemble. Nice clean design
40415601,. I love this for the grandkids bedroom toys
70301537,Great quality. This shelving unit is boss. Super secure and fits my scrapbook 3 ring binders perfectly. Love it!❤️ Super easy to put together too.
20275814,Great Shelf. This is a great shelf unit and I love the amount of things I can put into a box/ cubbies and it looks neat and clean.
00275848,Good design. I bought this weeks ago and it is just what I needed
60278170,"Sturdy and simple. We got a 4 by 4 Kallax for our bedroom and got a few of these cabinet doors for storage. The Kallax is used as a room divider, so it's great that the cabinet is solid from the back as well."
50334591,Worked Perfectly. We purchased 12 of these in the 2 sizes. They worked perfectly for what we were looking for. Only 1 gave husband trouble putting together.
90286649,Great functionality. Easy to put together and a great addition to the overall cube organizer
30275861,Love these shelves!. Have 6 sets of these shelves. Keep finding uses for more!
10305802,Easy to assemble. Wanted two levels of shelving for a tv and many books and framed photos. This fit the bill perfectly. Easy to assemble and looks great.
20275885,"Sturdy!. We bought this shelving unit for our kids playroom. It has nice size cubbies so many toys can be stored. It’s also very sturdy and looks really nice. I’m very happy with my purchase, especially because the price was great!"
20278167,. Very easy to install and looks very nice
70301537,"Excellent display unit!. After 10 years, we finally revamped our walk in closet. This shelf unit stored my shoes and purse collection. It looks so organized and fabulous! I get to see all my favorite shoes and purses and know exactly what to use in no time! With the added lighting, it even looks so professionally made! Loved it!"
00334536,"Bought this as an entryway piece. Looks great in gray, make sure you follow instructions and place on a rig for assembly, finish scratches pretty easily."
20275814,great storage. I bought this for my project room.Great place to store all my accessories for my crafts.
20275814,great value. Made very very well. We love it. Great price
80487813,Good for the price but. Good for the price but was a little more complicated to assemble than I thought.
40275846,Looks good. I bought about a month ago because the double unit would not fit in the available space but the price is too high. A $30.00+ price point would have made me happier.
40346924,Beautiful sturdy shelf unit.. I love the two tones on the item. Beautiful! We’re super happy with our purchase
10275862,"Great storage for Kids/Guest Room. I bought this piece this month and absolutely love it!!!!! My guest room was over run by grandkids toys, everywhere. Now....it looks like a guest room again. All of the kids toys are concealed in the handy tote boxes we also purchased. Toys are easily accessible and at the same time hidden from view. Books are together and organized. We still have 4 cubes empty for guest to use. This is one of the best purchases we have made in awhile. Thanks IKEA!"
70301542,What a value. Very happy with the solid construction for storing books and LP records. A great organizer in a compact space.
60275812,Missing A Lot of Parts. mItem came without 5 wooden pegs. Very disappointed.
20275885,. I have several of these and the uses are endless...
70301537,Beautiful. Originally our basement was not finished and had wall to wall shelving screwed into the studs. We didn’t want to put all those holds in the new sheet rock and bought two of the Kallax Shelf-Units. The assembly was easy for two people. These shelves are perfect for scrapbooks and supplies. All of your crafts will look so neat and tidy. All I have to do now is decide which storage inserts to use.
10275862,It Is Great!. It fits a lot of things and looks beautiful. I bought two. One for books and one for toys. I bought them when were on sale and it was very helpful! Thank you for good furniture at a reasonable price! I always recommend you!
20275814,"Great sturdy shelf. Heavy, sturdy big size. Is holding up well."
20275885,very sturdy and solid. This was a great fine....great price...wonderful quality..easy to put together
60275812,"Perfect for records!. Easy to put together, the grey is pretty but most of all it fits records straight up with extra space.Sturdy enough to fill with records, which can be very heavy."
10409932,Great Shelf. Created a home crafting center loved the outcome
80401292,perfect for craft room. I bought this to fit my deep refrigerator bins in to turn them into mini drawers to hold washi tape and other small items. It's nice to be to pull the entire bin out when I need the items being store in them and this insert makes it easy to see what is in each bin.
30275861,"Not as good as the old Expedit. This was much more difficult to assemble than previous IKEA purchases. When you try to tap together shelves with the wood dowels, it doesn't make a tight joint. The cam lock bolts were much better."
40346924,Awesome shelf. These are perfect for my craft room!
20409936,Great for records or books!. I use these as book shelves. Deep enough to have 2 rows of books in each cube which helped since I have limited wall space. And the cubes are tall enough to fit extra large books.
10305802,. I bought 4 of them for my bedroom if was a great IDEA
40415601,Great for record album storage. Perfect size for storing record albums. I store my albums on the lower shelves and use the upper shelves for books and other items. 2 drawers can be added to a cube. Attractive and sturdy.
20275885,"Just what I wanted.. Despite the frustration of putting together IKEA furniture, once it is complete and in its place, I quickly forget what it took to put it together. In the ten or more years that we have bought various items from IKEA, so far everything looks like it did when first put together. I expect the same of this shelf unit."
80275887,"awesome bookshelf. As with all the Kallax shelf units, they look great together and by themselves, are very sturdy and hold oversized books (like scrapbooks,for example)"
80275887,"Not great vertical but best horizontal. This is our replacement book shelf and matches our white walls. The pictures make it look plain, but this is actually an awesome product that has thickness to make it look premium that you can put out at the front of your house"
20275885,"Great shelves. Very easy to put together, easily customizable with the add ons. Looks great even on it's own"
20278167,Good addition to the basic storage unit. Bought and installed a couple of weeks ago and wish I had purchased three more.
40334558,Easy to assemble. The eket cabinet is easy to assemble and could make many configurations and make use of the interior and the top surface depending on how it is configured.
20275814,Absolutely love the shelves. They were really easy to put together I just wish that it had an extra couple wooden pegs. I bought 3 of them and lined a wall
90286649,Great product. I bought some of these in June. Loved them so much that when I got back to Ikea I bought more!!
20275814,. Problem with unit at install
10275862,Great piece of furniture. Easy to assemble I'm enjoying it
30275861,"Unbeatable. The Kallax units are unbeatable in design, flexibility, customization and quality/price ratio. We re so convinced of some IKEA products that we designed several spaces (e.g. walk-in closet, pantry, storage room) in our new home to perfectly fit and accommodate products like KALLAX or IVAR. Do I need to say more?"
80275887,Sturdy. Assembled easily and is very sturdy. Perfect for a low profile room divider.
80275887,Love the durability. I use this in my daycare space and it holds up nicely!
50481172,Perfect shelf for tight space. Perfect shelf for tight space in the laundry room
70301542,"Must lay flat to assemble.. The biggest challenge when my husband and I assembled this was laying it flat to do so. The upstairs of our home doesn't have any open floor spaces that large. That said, we assembled this unit in 45 minutes working as a team. I loaded it with photo albums and books and other than the dark colored wood showing dust like crazy we have been very happy with our purchase. We have another unit ten years old that's the same unit from ikea and it held a teenagers stuff till a few years ago when she moved out and now it holds crafting stuff. It still looks brand new."
70301542,"Cheap fitting.... Hi, While the furniture looks great, really great, I wish the fasteners were not cheap wood. It would have liked cam fitting with cam locks. That would make the mounting earlier, less noisy (no need to hammer and possibly damage the furniture) and safer. The dismounting and moving of the assembled furniture would have been much easier.  And once assembled, I start seeing the part come apart more easily with the wooden fastening, suggesting I should have glued things (which makes the furniture a little less ikea style). :("
80275887,. I'm using this as storage for inside my closet to organize certain clothing that doesn't go on hangers & to showcase shoes/ purses. & I love it! Assembling this was easy could defiantly build it on your own and its pretty sturdy.
60275812,Perfect!. I can't express the level of satisfied I am with this shelf. It is perfect and was easy to put together.
60278170,Looks amazing. We got these for our movie collection and I'm very impressed with how they look. Very clean and nice. Easy to assemble as well.
40275846,Sturdy and Great Looking. This shelf is very well made and stands up on its own very well. I don't have any fear of it tipping over. We use it in our small mud room to store shoes and it woks great.
40275846,Amazing. I bought this to use with other Kallax products for extra shelving and cat spaces in my home. The shelf attaches to the wall for added stability and is super easy to assemble.
00415599,Shelf. Shelf was quick and easy to assemble. Was the exact size and color and with the number of cubbies my teenager wanted in her room. It’s very versatile and multifunctional which she was looking for.
40415601,"These things are very versital.. This is the 5th one i have purchased. 2 of theme are in my home office used for books / 3 ring binders. I like their depth for the 3 rin binders. 2 of these are used for toy storage in the kids playroom. The last one i putchased hold a TV on top of it, and we put photo frames / nick-nacks on the inside. I would recommend this to anyone. I will be back for another one as, i keep adding binders / books and am running out of space. I think the shelves are a great value, some of the accessories, are pricey."
59278307,Perfect storage. This was perfect for my hobby room!
20275885,"Love the Kallax Shelf units. This is the 4th Kallax unit I have purchased. I love them all. I have purchased additional features and customized them for whatever I needed. I love the drawers, doors and other items to make each one special and unique."
50339292,"Super Cute for Insustrial Themed Room. Loved the style, but it ended up returned. Too flimsy to be a TV stand."
59278307,"Kallax 'cubbies' with doors and drawers. Great, versatile piece for bedroom, craft room, dining room."
00314642,"Look great, perform ehhh. As noted, these drawers look great and we love the finish. Downside is that the drawers cannot hold much weight. We use these for a storage unit in our dining room and needed it to hold extra jar candles. Once you put more than two or three in a drawer, the drawer is weighed down and comes off the tracks. Happy overall, just wish they held more."
20275885,Versatile and Stylish. Purchased three Units in black-brown for my craft room and they have worked out perfectly. Easy to assemble with a friend
30275861,Love all the Storage. We bought several Kallax shelves to create wall to wall storage in our play/school room.  We love how much storage the room has and that everything now has a proper home.

I bought 4, I am a little disappointed that I can't put them together on the shelves, I got a 2x4 kallax shelf, and I hoped to put all 4 in the top cubes, but because of the screws, I can't. But it works out really well regardless. The drawers match the shelf perfectly, it was easy to put together, and install in the shelves."
30275861,"Amazing Storage!. I have these shelf units in the 5x5 and 4x4 and they are perfect in my closet room. They hold all of my purses with room to spare, yet look modern and clean."

20213312,New product for me. Really impressed with this product and returning for other items. I knew of this lines desk and have admired it. My kids actually picked this in the store and it holds my vast dvd collection in the living room. I smile when I look at that area. It’s organized and neat.
00275848,Best storage unit. Classic storage solution - most excellent for clothing
70342199,Book shelf. Great size and fits what I wanted it for
10409932,Great Shelf. I love this shelf. I got it since I don't have a linen closet to hold my sheets and my books.
00275848,Worked perfectly!. We used several of these and a shelf to make a diy entertainment center and it worked perfectly!
60275812,Awesome!. Bought these to use as ends for a sewing table. Even better than i imagined...awesome!
20275885,Decent shelving unit. I bought this shelf with the hopes of fitting records on it. It works beautifully for this.
70286645,2 drawers. Dose just what it says and looks good doing it. Very good value for the money.
80401292,Easy instillation. Bought this to organize our wine. It is easy to put together and install in the shelf. My wine bottles fit great and I don't have to worry about them slipping out.
00415599,My Cubbies. I bought this a month ago. I Have two printers sitting on top of them with all my office supplies in the little cubbies. I did buy some baskets from IKEA to put the little things in and it fits great.
40346924,Perfect as a TV stand (55”). This bookshelf never lets me down. This is my third one (different colors). Very sturdy. Perfect for extra storage. I love the new color options too.
80275887,"Perfect Display. Easy to assemble, and great organizer for the grandkids room."
80303437,Perfect for my Stereo Cd player.. This is my second one!. I just love it.

29278304,"I like the the products. I like the the products looks. I like how strong the product is as well. Finally, the best part is the availability of inserts that one is able to use for mixing and matching for one's own personal design is the best part of this Kallax product."
40346924,"Looks Great!. I love this book shelf! It ended up being too large for the space we originally bought it for, but decided to lay it on it's side and use it as a TV stand and it works perfectly. I love the color and finish."
10305802,Love this place. We bought this for our daughter. It was easy to put together & I was really tired. She was very excited to get & likes it a lot.
20275814,"Perfect for a small space. This looks great right as you enter my front entryway. It's not too big, not too small with plenty of space on top and in the cubbies to display items. We used 2 of the rattan baskets which are made to fit in the Kallax cubbies, and they look very classy. We also purchased the 2X4 Kallax unit and turned it on its long side for another display/storage unit/table against a long wall. Again, it looks fabulous with a few rattan inserts (perfect for storing seasonal items that I rotate) and our other special items on display. We are thrilled with this purchase. Hope it lasts forever!"
80275887,Love this unit. I have about 6 of this type of units! I use them in so many different ways!
60221683,Really wish ikea still carried the smaller version. Great shelving unit! But if you’re listening ikea PLEASE BRING BACK the narrower version.
80275887,"Sturdy, easy to put together. This bookcase is now sideways, in my closet, holding bins of clothes and accessories. Works great. Installed two sets of drawers and used a bunch of IKEA bins. Very robust construction."
00275848,"Easy assembly. Very nice, just wish it was real wood"
70301542,"Great Storage Space. Just set this up, it assembles easily all though two people are a must for this. The openings are the perfect size for records. With the deep shelves if you store DVDs or books on there you have space for chachkies in front of them. I still have open space on it that i am trying to figure out what to put on there."
20275885,"Best shelf ever!. Love this self unit, bought one and loved how sturdy and solid this unit is. After getting the shelf unit home and putting it together, the following weekend I went and bought another one! I bought them for my boys bedrooms, after having them a month now I'm going back to buy two more of them(they both will be in the bottom of our closet for footwear)"
40415601,Works perfectly to store my. Works perfectly to store my 12 x 12 scrapbook collection.
10409932,"Great Toy Storage. Perfect piece to store our grandsons toys yet, let him be able to actually see them all. They don't all end up at the bottom of a box. SUPER easy to assemble."
60333954,"Assembly is nightmare!!!. I appreciate the concept that tried to eliminate the amount of bolts and nuts for assembly, however, the pieces are not easy to fit together even by following the instruction exactly. Assembly requires a lot of brute force to fit panels together. Very frustrating. After trying to assemble pieces using my own weight and other non-conventional means, I broke two bookcases and I now wish IKEA covered for emotional damage and wasted time."
40275846,"Sturdy with very nice veneer. Sideways = ottoman. This is a very stout unit, and since buying this, I am planning to buy several more. Good value for price, and able to hold heavy items."
80275887,Excellent Shelf for Scrapbookers. I use this shelf to hold all of my Project Life albums along with two bins at the bottom that holds my supplies. It is perfect for displaying my albums and very sturdy!
60275812,Love the look and the storage!. This is the second shelf unit I purchased. Love the storage using the storage cubes!
80275887,"So stylish and functional. We turned this on the long side to use as a long table/console in our entryway. Looks fabulous with a few of the rattan inserts for the cubbies. Love that we can reconfigure the inserts many different ways. Perfect for displaying some of our personal treasures in the cubbies, and the top surface can be used for display or other practical purposes like arrival/departure zone as people enter and leave. If we ever want to reconfigure our room, we can always turn it on the short side too. Very versatile and elegant looking. Love it!"
70301542,"Practically Perfect. Bought this for my son's new teenager room. We only had one wall available, so we needed a LOT of storage and versatility. The Kallax series works great for us - lots of options, sturdy build, and it holds nearly everything (really tall things go on top!). I put this piece together by myself, except for the very last step where I needed to tilt the whole case to put in the last two screws. But one resourceful person could probably do it - it's really easy to assemble."
80303437,"Love these shelves!. I have a few of the shelves in this series, they're easy to assemble and I love the price. They're so minimalist and airy, I think they're really beautiful and tend to match everything."
19278272,Simple and efficient. Bought this to revamp an office/study area. Worked with three units for ultimate flexibility. Changed up the pulls on the doors to match room decor - love it.
90305803,"Looks great. I'm very pleased with this shelf unit. I like that the middle shelf is glass, which lets some light through to the bottom. The instructions say to drill holes in the two non-glass shelves to attach them to the frame, but I didn't bother and just have the shelves sitting in the frame. It's working fine so far. I wanted something sleek and modern, and that's what I got."
60275812,"Excellent Product. Purchaed for office storage solution. It is the perfect size and with the adage of storage bins, it keeps unappealing paper products out of sight."
20275885,"This one of my favorite items!!!. This shelf can be used as a book/pictures display, a TV stand, if turned on it's side or a linen closet shelf. I placed three (3) next to each in my family room and the effect is amazing with pictures, books, and figurines display."
60278170,Love. Look good to add and perfect color
80275887,"Chic glossy white. Purchased for bathroom storage. The glossy white looks amazing next to my charcoal gray walls. Some tapered legs added to the look. Only issue is that it's hard to get spacing/gaps around doors and drawers even, but it's not that noticeable."
40275846,Perfect product - TV stand. I bought this a month ago to be used sideways as a stand for my 55inch TV. Very happy with the purchase for this price. I would recommend this product. The only missing thing is that there is no sheet at the back of the shelf which leaves all the cables hanging and visible when viewing from the front.
80275887,Dining room buffet. I got this to use as a buffet in the dining room.   Placing it horizontal means it is the perfect height.  Plenty of storage and display space. It was a quick and easy assembly.
80275887,"flexible uses. Easy for one person to put together, great for both vertical and horizontal uses."
20275885,"Wish they had Solid Grey. I've been using these for years, they are sturdy and fulfill its purpose....have had some in black/brown...then i painted them grey and had those for another year, then i sold them on craigslist, they were really high in demand, people ended up bidding on them.....and then i bought them in white (which is more off-white, sadly, it doesnt match with my other white furniture, like my bed and my nightstand and my dresser and my fireplace)...I've been hoping for Ikea to finally make these in Grey...and finally they do, but its not completely grey...it has this unfinished wood looking thing on the front and its ugly...i am looking for solid grey! do i really need to paint my white ones grey again??? ugh, so much work!"
70339291,"Great Piece!. Easy to assemble and, has a good amount of storage space."
80275887,Kallax shelf. Simple design. Easy to build. Lots of room for book storage.
70286645,. Works well for my closest
00415599,Love the size. I bought this a month ago. Perfect height to put extra crafting supplies on the top.
40346924,Love it!. Very well made. Sturdy. Love the color.
00415599,Excellent!. Excellent product. Easy to assemble. Looks great!
10345073,Nice addition to the Lappland entertainment center. Quick and easy to add on and fits well above books/games/movies for extra storage. Feels sturdy.
00275848,"Multi-purpose!. A great storage piece, especially for the price, and it's multi-purpose! Can lay it down or stand it up and anchor it. Can use as shelves or put pillows or a cushion on top and lay it down along the floor and it can function as a bench. Put bins in it for additional storage. It's nice to be able to do different things with it. For our space, we laid each one down (purchased 2) and used corresponding fabric bins to store the kids' toys. Works great in the play area. We also displayed toy playsets on top. Highly recommend!"
70301542,Great storage option. Worked for the storage we needed and looks nice in the area we placed it in
80275887,. I bought this as a shelf for my classroom and love it.
80428852,"how can u miss IKEA. great product but huge design flaw with ikea that they missed the door to this model. only white comes with the door., in US."
40275846,It's very versital. We've bought a few of these. My husband uses his as a divider. I used the ones I purchased as a bed platform.
20409936,Great make ch. Great match to my Hemnes bedroom
20275885,"Use Kallax vertically or horizontally. Kallax made the perfect bookshelf and TV stand for my living room. I bought two units and like the flexibility of having one horizontal for the TV and the other one vertical (either way, they hold the same number of books)."
20275885,great product. bought 6 of these for organization in our finished basement along with some of the boxes that fit for at home daycare....look and work great
19278328,Easy and perfect for our walk-in closet!. Easy to put together and it works great in our walk-in closet!
19278253,". Easy to assemble, works great"
60275812,Great features for its price. I bought this item a month ago and assembled it. It was easy to do so and I am so happy to have this so far.
20275885,Love the look. I got mine a month ago and it’s very nice. I use it as a t.v stand for my 55” television.
30275861,"Great quality, exactly what we needed. I got these shelves for my home office to replace dark wood book shelves. The room is already dark b/c it is next to a hedge and gets no direct sunlight. The openings are a great size and the IKEA bins that I got to go in the openings for my stuff well. I got both the 5x5 and 4x4 units. The depth of 15” gives more than enough room and allows me to stack some items 2 deep. The unita come with wall anchors so there is no danger of them tipping over. My husband and a friend assembled them and it took two ppl for the 5x4 but only one person for the 4x4."
10305741,Versatile. Bought this one use as my daughters dresser with storage cubes but considering buying two more for storage in my classroom!
50339292,"Great Look,Great Features,concerned about Quality. I purchased this to match another shelf in the series, and absolutely love the look and features. After waiting for months for this item to become available again, I looked forward to finally getting it home to put together. While I am mostly satisfied with the shelf, it seems the manufacturer rushed this batch and welded 2 components in the wrong direction! Another minor concern is that one of the doors does not line up with the other. I would think a proper Q/C inspection would have caught this. I ended up just removing the 2 components myself as the shelf will hold without them. Just wanted to leave constructive feedback so IKEA is aware!"
20275885,New version is total garbage. We have about 7 of older version of these and needed one more. New one is horrible. 5 of the edge veneers were 90% unglued and needed to be glued and clamped. In 3 spots wooden pegs into into voids (no wood behind the holes). In 2 spots wooden pegs broke through the exterior veneer leaving holes in the finish. Interior shelves are now thinner and don't match the thickness of the sides and tops. Assembled unit feels flimsy and torques and wobbles - old version was solid as a rock.
50305739,Love love love. I have about 4-5 of this brand shelfing but I never hit the 4 square one. I purchased these with glass tops for my dinning room. I made on a mini bar and the other has my dishes.
80275887,Super storage unit. I was able to assemble this storage cube by myself and with ease. I am using it in my guest room/ sewing room. Now I have the storage I needed for all my sewing products.
70332124,Hold to assembly 😢. Hold to assembly 😢
20275885,"Looks great thanks. I bought this item for my living room, works perfectly"
00415599,KALLAX. Looks great! and super easy to ensamble!
80275887,Great Purchase!. Can never go wrong with this product. Assembly was easy and my home office looks like it got a makeover! It looks more organized and inviting.
80275887,"Reliable shelving. This shelving set was the right size and fits well with a desk I had bought previously from Ikea. One of the shelves, however, had not been pre-drilled, forcing me to drill the missing holes. This (and other problems I had with a cabinet purchased with these shelves) surprised me, as I had previously had good experience with the quality of Ikea products."
10275862,Nice sturdy shelf. I bought this to break up my studio apartment and it's quite nice. Gives me some nice shelf space and is easy to put together alone. I almost want to to buy another one to get more of a wall.
00275848,Great. Simple and easy to out together Perfect for little girls room to hide all the toys...
10409932,Easy assembly. I bought this to organize my sewing room. It is wonderful. No more clutter.
30275861,. Solved a problem for my son’s room.
10345073,Great!. Lovely wire basket. Easily fit into my Kallax shelf unit where I store my bills for the month. Light weight and doesn't weigh down the shelf. Great price and quality.
80275887,"Versatile. This shelf is versatile. Can be horizontal or vertical. You can also add drawers, doors, boxes to it. Love it! It is easy to put together, but is easier with two people."
30275861,"Using as a dresser. I bought the kallax along with 12 drona boxes to use as a dresser in my bedroom. The drona boxes are really deep, hold all my clothing perfectly. If you have young children you really should use the wall mount. While it is stable for me to use without being mounted, I could see it easily tipping over if someone where to climb on it and it's pretty heavy."
50214678,. I have this item and I bought it during the summer and I needed another one because I didn’t have enough room to put all my stuff on it so I went and bought another one I just love the shelves my shelves have all monopoly games on them because I have over 50 on open monopoly games so they’re all on the shelves thank you so much I will be returning Susan
80275887,Well built. Sturdy. Well built. Looks great in both rooms. Had one and purchased another one.
60275812,Great storage!. I love this unit! It has been fantastic for keeping my kids backpacks organized.
20409936,Great piece!. We bought this to create a desk space for my son. We got the desk top to clip on to the shelving and it looks great together. Plenty of storage and doesn't take up too much space! Looks great!
20275885,Truly fantastic service and quality. Truly fantastic service and quality of promptness
60278170,Really love the looks of. Really love the looks of the shelf with the added door and drawers
10275862,Sturdy and efficient. Picked up a 4x4 to display records. It's the perfect size and style. Each cube can hold around 75 records and there is no visible bowing. Just be sure you remember which end is up - if you set it on its side you're compromising the structural integrity!
10275862,Great for kids. Should come with extra pegs
20275814,Affordable Quick Buy. Needed something quick for organizing and this was very affordable and quick! Very durable!
60333954,"Great product! Read Review!. I bought this thinking it would be tough to put together. You have to follow the direction to a T! Make sure you pay attention to the distance between the holes so you know which piece to use where. Start with piece 1!!!! If you follow all the directions, it is super easy and quick to put together. I appreciate not using any hardware. This piece is very very study once you get everything together correctly. It is for sure more sturdy than the Kallax. The dark blue color wasn't as dark as I thought it would be but it ended up working just fine."
30275861,"Solid, nice-looking shelving unit. Bought and assembled this item a few weeks ago and we are quite satisfied with it so far."
50339292,". I bought this a month ago and I'm glad tha I did, it serves as storage, eating table and it looks great as an island."
20409936,Great features. I bought this last month I really loved it
50481172,Nicely seized shelves. These shelves can store a lot. They were challenging to put together.
70342199,perfect for our foyer. we use in combo with the matching tv shelf in our foyer.
80275887,. Bought to organize our play room and went back and bought another because I liked it so much!
10409932,Great looking!. Love this! Going back to get another one soon!
60221683,"Sturdy but manufacture flaws. It's sturdy and really big. It can hold a lot of things. Perfect for organization. The only reason I gave it two stars was because there were huge long dent on one of the shelves and one tiny dent on another shelves. You don't notice this until you peel the blue protector sheets and the two problematic shelves were, of course, the last ones unwrapped. This is really heavy and the store is too far to un-assemble and return, wait in the huge line. But for the price on the shelf...I would really like a perfect conditioned item. Don't know where the quality check is but a little disappointing."
40346924,Grey features. Love this. Just what I needed.
60275812,Sturdy!. Excellent and versatile piece of furniture...
20275885,Great stand.. Bigger and more sturdy than closetmaid shelves. Better value too.
60275812,Great Product but. Great Product but
20275885,"Great TV stand. We had bought a 60 TV and were having a difficult time finding a suitable size TV stand for it. We already own the Kallax 16 cube shelf, so we bought this one so it matches. The TV fit perfectly and all the accessories fit well. It's sturdy, looks good and has plenty of storage area. Very happy with the purchase."
80275887,. Terrific!! Easy to put Together and looks great!
30275861,"Nice shelf unit!. We have been very pleased with the Kallax Shelf Unit. I use this, along with some fabric boxes, for organization in my project room. This is well made, does exactly what it is designed to do."
40275846,"Sturdy. I am very pleased with this sturdy, attractive shelving. Easy assembly. I especially love how all IKEA products coordinate so adding baskets to improve functionality was easy."
10409932,Easy. Easy to put together and sturdy. Looks great in our bonus room
30275861,"Nice alternative to bookcases. Bought two - husband remarked how EASY they were to assemble.  Looks great in our library, so much better than a wall.of bookcases. I really really like the look, extremely versatile for our needs (storing stuff)"
10305741,"Great product with reasonable price. Good look, functional n reasonable price"
00415599,. Love everything about the product!
10275862,"Awesome room divider!. This works great as a room divider in our huge bonus room. We had planned to use as a bookcase against the wall but the shelves are deep so by making it a room divider it allows us to put books, movies, cds, etc on BOTH sides and double the storage space. It also allows us to easily see everything. Now we want another one!"
20275885,Cube organizer. Love it. Perfect choice
29278262,"Quite sturdy!. This is my third purchase of this product for my craft room and I totally love these shelves as they are so versatile in their usage. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because I wanted this to match the ones I’ve bought in the past but they no longer carry the oak in the store near me so I had to get the white or black and decided on the white. Had I known before that the oak would get phased out, I would have purchased the white to start with so everything matches. It also appears to look slightly different from the ones I bought previously."
80275887,Very very nice shelves. I had no troubles assembling it and it looks and works just great. Planning to buy more.
80275887,Love this unti!. You simply cant go wrong with this unit!
20275885,Excellent Quality and more!!. Great quality. Very sturdy and easy to assemble (did it by myself)! The shelves are high enough to fit books and other goodies.
30275861,Awesome Shelf. I bought this to redo my craft room and I love it. I used task rabbit to put it together.
60278170,Hassle to build but looks great.. Definitely tricky to assemble but the end result looks great. Wish it would come with some sort of cut outs in case you want to run wires through.
00275848,Sturdy and well made. This shelving unit was so easy to assemble. It’s really a lot sturdier than I thought it would be for the price.
20275885,"Love it!. We have several of these all over the house because they are so great for storage. We have them in different colors and with different cubes but they look wonderful, they are easily assembled and they are great space savers."
70286645,"Works well. I bought this to reduce tabletop clutter and it is working out great. I have storage for chargers, phone, tablet, book etc."
00275848,excellent storage and display product. very convenient for my sewing room. Easy access to all my fabrics and totes with projects in them.
50339292,". I bought two of these and turned a wall in the kitchen into a coffee station, i love it, we get compliments on it all the time, and some of our friends couldn't believe that it was Ikea, and we very proudly said yes, it is!. They are sturdy, beautiful, we get to display all of my pretty mugs. Great buy!!"
80487813,Good useful shelf. Good useful shelf
70342199,"Sturdy, well designed, useful shelf. The shelf provided extra storage inside a closet. We like it's size - deeper than typical 12 deep shelves and just the right height."
10275862,Space saver!. This is the 3rd Kallax in my home. We love it! we can fit and hide toys so easy in it compared to other good looking storage units and being able to add color boxes depending in the rooms they are is a plus. Easy to put together and great quality our first one is 7 years old and still looking like day one.
80275887,"great use. this is not the first shelf unit we have bought, they are great for any room in the house."
40415601,Chillax with Kallax!. Excellent product easy to assemble and looks awesome!
30275861,great storage. Easy to put together except for the last screw. Will see if my son can get it to work. Refused to take it apart to see if the hole was not predrilled correctly. I have almost filled it up with fabric for my quilts. Plan to go back to get another 4 cube unit to put beside it.
70332124,"I love it. This is simple to put together, beautifully sleek in my colorful place. It's easy to store anything and has a weight to it so it wont get kicked if on the floor or fall from any shelf. It is perfect for the illusion of un-cluttering the place as it opens up the space with its lightness"
90305803,"Clean & Modern. This has been a wonderful addition to our home -- visually light, it's openness does not bog down the room. It was simple to assemble and was ready to use within 20 mins."
10305741,Love them!. I’ve received so many compliments on them also. I couldn’t be happier with them.
50214678,"Vittsjo. A little bit wobbly, but overall a great product, great design, fits perfectly in small spaces."
60275812,Simple and affordable.. I bought this for my laundry room. I added some cloth baskets and some pretty knick knacks. Gorgeous!
20275885,Works great. Bought this a month ago for the kid's playroom. Kids are able to easily use the bins for toys and it keeps the room looking clean.
60278170,"2 out of 3. I purchased 3 of these, 2 went in super smooth and the 3rd is slightly off, just to be partially annoying, They all look nice and it makes the Kallax look really put together."
80275887,"Uncomplete Item. Double check boxes before you live the store, a big piece was missing, the thing is than I've sent this boxes to Mexico, no way to fix the problem"
10345073,Creative shelf in a shelf. I like this shelf for the Kallax bookcase. I wish it was in Rose Gold instead but that's just my preference. Quality is good and I attach it to my Kallax bookxase and use it as an inbox for incoming mail.
10275862,Sturdy and easy to put together!. Bought this shelving unit for my classroom. It S exactly what I was looking for and works perfectly for my purposes.
70286645,A little flimsy. I bought this product thinking it was a sturdier. I don't think I'll purchase this again. It looks good but not what I expected for the price.
99017445,"Nice and pretty. This was pretty easy to build ( I am not good at building things). However, this was easy and it looks nice."
70301542,I surprisingly was able to. I surprisingly was able to put this together by myself and just needed my husband to help me lift it up off the floor. Love how it looks! Great value for the price.
20409936,Kallax 12 slot. Easy to assemble and organize my daughter's things love the product.
20275814,Great Product. I bought a few of shelf units in a couple months ago. This product is very nice with a great price. I love it.
80275887,"Great, sturdy, multipurpose. I bought mine for tv stand and storage space, I have a tiny home. My daughter bought hers for children's toys. Both work and look amazing!"
20275814,Great Storage. I bought these to organize my walk-in closet. The fabric cubes that fit in the openings hold a ton of clothes. I will be buying more for other areas in my house.
30275861,"Cats love it!  Easy to assemble!. Our cats have had tons of fun with our Kallax, so we are glad we have lots of large Kallax.  Here great for craft room and kids room and we have co quivered our clutter. Expect for the bits the cats can reach as they push stuff off the Kallax"
60333954,"Looks great, nightmare to assemble. As others noted the assembly is not the familiar post and dowel. It took me 4 hours on one of the units, as the pins and holes were not aligned well. I finally succeeded but the 4 unit cube is not quite square. The underframe is slightly separated. The second one was okay but still an hard assembly. I like the white cube with the natural wood frame. Perfect for a flexible set of bookcases. Recommended for those with patience."
80275887,Matching height with a desk from IKEA. I'm using this shelf unit side way to use this as a side desk. the height is 30 inches which matches with ALEX white desk. Perfect to insert drawer unit or basket unit.
90286649,"Great product. Gives a second different look to the shelf’s , easy to ensamble, functional."
59278307,Kallax. Works great for my art room!
70301537,"Good product. We used it to organize our closet . Super happy with it, worth the money ."
10305802,"Great looking and useful!. So happy I bought this piece. I was debating between a closed chest of drawers and this shelf unit. Glad I picked this. I use baskets for storage as well as the top for books, etc. Great buy!"
20275814,Very sturdy. We’ve bought 6 of these. The cubical inserts hold soo much!!
70301537,"Looks nice for the most part. Assembled by myself in about one evening. The white looks nice in our room. However, I feel there's a small defect in the design that is more apparent with white 5x5 KALLAXes than with other models--the outside vertical boards seem to bow outward a little bit, to the point that there's a small gap between them and the ends of the middle horizontal boards. I wish there was something I could do to remove or reduce that gap."
20275885,"Rich Looking Storage & Display Shelf. I bought this unit when we were selling outback home and we were asked if we had it professionally staged. The unit is easy to assemble, sturdy, and looks gorgeous!"
30275861,. sturdy and looks great! assembly took some 30 min.
50334591,"ultimately serves the purpose. I bought this to fit a small space in my son's room. I stacked three of them, stair-stepper fashion, as a book shelf. They serve the purpose that I bought them for, but I struggled to put them together. I tried for hours to get them to click. I watched several videos. I pushed, I pulled, I pounded. I did not want to damage them, but they would not budge. I had two of them three-quarters built, but I could not get the last side on. I took them back to the store and asked an IKEA employee to help me; otherwise, I was going to return them. The employee did help me. He slammed them together, and I built the third one at the little station in the store and used the hammer to finish the fourth side. They are fine for a kid's room, but they are too frustrating to build."
70339291,Metal and wood. Nice unit. Took about 3 hours to assemble. A cordless screwdriver would have shortened time especially for wood screws. Follow directions and sort hardware.
20275885,"Very versatile. I have several of these throughout my home they function as TV stands, trendy looking dressers with the storage container they can be whatever I need them to be."
80275887,Works as required. I am so happy I purchased this Shelf Unit. I also purchased one more like it and the three across unit. Solid construction and looks great.
40346924,Modern and versatile. I have several of these in different colors and sizing. It's the perfect shelving unit as it is pretty versatile and easy to put together especially if you are familiar with IKEA directions and have a little muscle. I would highly recommend this. I've used this as clothing storage and as a bookcase.
70286645,Great kallax accessory. Simple to assemble. Works well for baby clothes.
20275814,love the piece but assembly issues. furniture pieces arrived damaged with 2 divits and a chip.I decided to keep it because retuning it would be a hassle. when putting pieces together wooden dowels would not fit into holes. I had to take a screw driver to gouge out each hole to fit dowels in.
50214678,Love it. Great shelf! Love the feet adjusters on the bottom so the shelf is sturdy on my uneven floors
20275814,Super sturdy. I used 3 units along with some plywood and casters to make the perfect size and height cutting table in my quilting studio. Paired with the drona bins it looks perfect.
70301542,Love. Huge. Great price. Easy to put together. Sturdy.
50339292,"It looks expensive and elegant. We have a modern furniture in our living room, in colors of black and burnt honey. This piece looks perfect with it. We also purchased 3 cloth storage bins to fit in the bottom, where we store all of our dog's stuff... bags, leash, cookies, harness. That way those are hidden but convenient. We got many compliments and no one believes us that we bought it in Ikea. I put the whole unit together myself, and refused husband's help which was unnecessary. :)"
40303439,Perfect. I absolutely love this shelving unit. i plan on getting another one.
10275862,Love it. Love it
10275862,Love the shelves. Even though it’s a shelving unit we use it for clothes. The cubbies fit folded T-shirt’s and jeans. My husbands T-shirt’s and jeans are organized and it’s easy for him to find just the piece he’s looking for.
20275814,Love the storage it provides. Bought this product & others of varying sizes to organize my sewing room. These work great
20275814,Love it!. Super easy to put together. Pretty sturdy too.
00275848,"Solid, clean lines and versatile. Solid, clean lines and versatile"
80275887,Great item.. I have several of these - love them. This new one has been reinforcing..love the quality.
50339292,". This piece works perfectly for me! - 32 tv on top, DVD/VCR player and record player (side by side) on lower open shelf and record albums and DVDs & old VHS movies behind metal mesh doors.How FUN is that!"
20275885,The Worst. I brought this a month ago and it did not come with the screws for me to put the unit together. When I called the store about this problem they told me to contact the vendor who makes the unit. Needless to say I never got the screws and the unit is sitting and has not been put together. The unit cost me 60.00 and now I just wasted the money.
60275812,Love this product. I needed a unit to organize a small area in my home. On a budget but needed it to be sturdy and attractive. This unit worked perfectly. So much so that I came back and purchased another one. Thank you for quality affordable products.
70301542,"Organizing Behemoth. I had a TaskRabbit person assemble this, but he did it quickly (an hour or less) and only needed my assistance holding it up to install the grounding hardware (err... walling hardware? whatever those pieces are to make sure a 200 pound shelf doesn't come crashing down on you). I meant to get the 4 x 4 one not the 5 x 5 one, but turns out I needed those 9 extra KALLAX cubes and that way I can decorate them them in fun ways too. I wish some of the inserts/organizers weren't so expensive, but the shelf as is, is a great value. I was surprised the parts fit in my Jeep Renegade and man it was difficult to get 66 lbs upstairs on my own (there are 4 boxes- 2 are 33 pounds, 2 are 66 pounds), but I did it. Now I want to replace an old book shelf I have with the 4 x 4 that can also double as a room divider."
20275885,Great shelving!. This is the 3rd one. I keep going back to it because it's not only a bookcase it's also great for shelving. Turned on its side it holds a TV and a Computer. Highly recommend.
80275887,Perfect storage for bedroom. We bought this for five year old granddaughter’s small bedroom. We placed unit on its side with baskets on the lower squares she now has plenary of space to organize her toys and Legos. This kid loves to be organized and this fills a real need in her room. Easy to assemble and should serve well for a long time.
20275885,Awesome for Vinyl Records!. Excellent for Vinyl Records!!!
80275887,Great. perfect for what I needed.
20275885,"lots of options. It is simple to put to together and they offer so many options to put in these cubicles. I put drawers and doors and some bins. Also bought a biggest 25 cubicle unit for another room. We were putting this one over a heater intake and I found legs on line that had adjustable heights from IKEA ! My husband did a couple things to it to make it earthquake proof instead of using their anti tip brackets because of the limited locations that the brackets had to go, they were not where the studs were but it's all good. A problem solver and the price is right! Love it! I just wish they make a 6 cubicle one, I have another problem area that needs this."
60275812,"So easy to assemble! Great looking storage.. I purchased this last month to place atop the Malm three drawer chest. We have two Malm six drawer pieces with two three drawer pieces on either side. I needed some thing for photos and decorative items but didn't want shelves. I got the dark brown and it looks good with the Malm dark brown. It was so easy to put together! Did it in record time, by myself. Considering another to place on a huge bathroom vanity for storage."
60278170,"Love the option. Should be redesigned. While it's great to be able to add doors for a relatively affordable amount (they quickly add up once you start put several in a kellax shelving unit!), the combination of the kellax not forming spaces of even and consistent size, will make adding these inserts a bit of a pain and very time consuming as they need a fair amount of tweaking. At times could get quite challenging depending on which position you need them installed as that would really make a difference since in some spots the kellax has inconsistent dimensions due to the structure not being as rigid as it 'd need to be for inserts to have a nearly perfect fit no matter where they're placed. Generally a re a good option and you can make it work well if you are resourceful when hitting a snag and have lots of patience which regardlessly is usually a chief requirement when assembling IKEA furniture to begin with. Just don't get upset or intimidated should something not fit perfectly... take a breath and a breath then think of the best solution to the misalignment, excessive gaps and do on... then get back to it and to try and see if what you thought about will fix the issue, most likely it will ;) If would be great to see these redesigned in a way which would not need so much tweaking, adding spacers, get different screws, adding adhesive sealing strips or padding where needed. Perhaps even get a cheap frosted plastic/lexan sheet swinging on a side tube that would act as a hinge where the top and bottom sides would have a shallow well to which the vertical plastic hinge would be anchored (just a thought) :)"
10409932,Craft room storage. This was easy to assemble. I stacked one on top of the other. Provides ample space for my crafting stuff!!
50305739,Disappointed. I bought this to match one I bought a couple of years or so ago. Turns out they are not the same size
50339292,Great feature!. I brought two of this unit one month ago. I am very happy to get them.
80275887,Awesome Book shelf!. I bought it recently and I'm so Happy!
20275885,Sturdy and perfect. I bought this and loved it so much that I bought another. I am very happy with the quality. It is very sturdy and was very easy to assemble. I am seriously considering buying another one or more.
40346924,shelving unit grey/wood. Love the duo color. Works great with our rooms and decor.
60275812,"Awesome. These shelf units are really simple modern looking and useful. we are using them as book shelf, because they can bear more weight than the usual bookshelf and we can arrange them in different spots of our rooms."
30275861,Great space saver. So happy with my purchase. These cubes are sturdy and look great in any room.
60333954,Looks great but what a pain to put together.. Love our new bookshelf but was not the easiest thing to put together. I had read the reviews prior to purchasing and took note to follow the instructions. Make note of every attachment placement in the instructions as the pins/attachments are in different locations. The last piece is a pain to attach! It wouldn't fit on with the backboard and ended up taking it off in order to get the last side piece to fit. It's super cute once it's all complete!
20278167,"Love having doors, drawers, and bins. I really like have doors on the upper row of shelves in our 2 units. It is an easier way to access the things I store in there. With a bin on the high shelf, I would have to pull it all the way out to get something. I would recommend using a small drill bit to start the screw holes."
60275812,Love the KALLAX line ofproducts. Easy to assemble and sturdy.
50305739,"Sleek and Just Beautiful. We purchased the gray-turquoise unit. Absolutely love it, looks great in our study especially in the color we chose. We were missing 1 peg but no harm done. It would be an improvement if there was something to hide the screw heads, but all in all would purchase this again."
20275885,"Perfect piece. Not too big not too small, it makes for a perfect entertainment center. Very sturdy and the cubbies are perfect to fit storage containers!"
00415599,Kallax Unit. Sturdy and looks nice.
30275861,Love it!. I bought this for my garage; easy to build and very sturdy!
80275887,"white kallax double shelf unit. functional, minimal, affordable, sturdy; was actually waiting for similar unit in birch, but it was not available when 2 shipment dates given to us."
10345073,Nice size!. This is a great addition to my pantry. Great for filling those holes under the shelves
00415599,"Great storage option. This product has so many design uses, is finished nicely and makes a modern clean statement. I used this in several areas of my home for utilitarian book shelves, as a room divider and with the addition of inserts, a wine rack."
30275861,"Great purchase!. Sturdy, and I love the storage spaces. I also love how large and sturdy the containers are for the cubbies. The color options go great with my decor as well."
30275861,"Extremely Versatile. I now have 5 of these in my house and love them. They are very versatile and we’ve used them in different rooms of our house. (Play room, craft room, kids rooms, and game room)"
80275887,". I bought this product with storing clothes in mind, and it works great for that, but that's about it for me. I'm having trouble finding where else to put anything else. I'd recommend the baskets, but the baskets are very poor quality so I'd recommend getting your own if you plan to store anything that isn't easily stored."
39285808,. I love how this looks and mounts so easily!
40275846,Excellent value. I love the value and versatility of these units
10305741,Great for dorm rooms!. I bought this piece for my daughter’s dorm room and it is perfect for extra storage and using as a tv stand.
20275814,"Easy to assemble!. This is the third one of these we've purchased, along with some of the larger units. All were a breeze to assemble, and they're a wonderful size."
89275091,Looks great. Excellent buy for the money. Looks great. It was just what we needed. And it is easy to assemble. I love how well the assembly is thought out so well.
20275885,Solid Shelves. I got these in the As Is section and they are great.
20275814,Perfect storage. The kallax units are perfect for accessories and shoe storage I used them to create a accessories closet in a spare bedroom at a fraction of the price of the estimated price from one of the fancy closet design companies
70286645,Just what I needed. My only complaint is that the white is a little off compared to my unit. I've had my Kallax unit for some years though so that was ok. The drawers took a month to arrive but they did give me the exact date when I ordered. It was also during COVID-19 so expected. They were easy to putt together and install. The only thing I did differently was drill pilot holes because it made screwing it in to the unit easier.
80275887,"Love and waiting for a color that seems to be taking forever to be available.. I am very pleased with the product and I am waiting for a picticular color to become available for my livingroom.Its been out forever,hope it becomes available by thus summer."
40346924,"Attractive unit for records & music stuff. We bought this for our album collection, record player, receiver, cd player and disc holder. Turned out great! Easy to assemble and feels very sturdy. Like the wood grain edging and gray sides."
80275887,Awesome!. Great storage at a great price. Works well for a TV Console.
10305802,"Affordable and sleek. Easy to build, looks great in my living room"
40415601,Best Shelving Unit. We have purchased 4 different KALLAX units for our homes. These units are sturdy and versatile.
00275848,Sturdy and simplistic. Love this shelving unit. Placed in 10 year old girls room. Perfect to display her craft projects and books
70286645,"Really cool but not easy to assemble.. I like this drawer. I wish it were easier to assemble. I needed a drill to get the screws into the shelf, I didnt have a drill. I thought it would just be pretty basic assembly like many of the other ikea products."
70301542,"Love our Kalax. We bought this to use as a room divider and it is perfect, beautiful and has so much storage. I am going to purchase another for my craft room when I can afford it."
60275812,"Use as bedside dresser. Takes about 20 minutes to assemble then I use the cubes as drawers, perfect next to bed for clothes, other one in dining room, and I store my papers and laptop in cubes."
80275887,"Versatile, nice, modern.. Okay. I got this one because I wanted to get rid of the humongous entertainment center that I have. PROS: This came in handy being that it can be used in a vertical or horizontal way. It's not difficult to understand how to put it together, it takes little space when one has a small (office/living/dining) space. Clean, modern and versatile. CON: need two people to put it together if you don't have the space and or furniture to maneuver around it. The pegs need to be hammered in because no all holes are standard and some are smaller and is difficult for the pegs to go in. One has to do so very carefully. Otherwise, since is made of pressed sawdust, it becomes very easily to crack the edges. I don't remember if it states on the directions, but one needs a star screwdriver to put the little thingies that are mounted to the wall. No. It doesn't fit my cable box, but I have enough books to fill it in."
70286645,"Awesome!. Easy to install, slide smoothly!"
50339292,Great Feature. I bought it to use it as a console and it worked out perfectly
20275885,Lots of storage and very deep.. I rotated this piece long ways. I have more surface to work with that way.
10345073,"Great to help utilize the gaps in Kallax cubes. I bought this to go with two Kallax that are now being used as an entertainment center. The basket is great for my DVD player and roku to suspend up from the top of a cubby while sliding a smaller storage box underneath. Very stylish. One recommendation though, is that you be sure you have it where you want it and any electrical cords situated *before* you latch the back, because it is really difficult to unlatch if you decide you want to move it to a different compartment. Otherwise, no complaints!"
10275862,"Sturdy bookshelf!. We bought our first Kallax shelf unit seven years ago. We bought another one a month ago. There is a definite difference in weight of the product and a little difference in height and width. You can tell they’ve tried to save on materials. Notwithstanding, this product is still incredibly sturdy and meets our needs perfectly! We love this product! We have used it as a bookshelf for our home library and also a toy shelving unit with the colorful buckets you find everywhere. The square is the perfect dimension and fits things nicely. Also, assembly was easy enough for my five-year-old son and I to put it together. We had a great time doing it together too! I highly recommend this product!!!"
80275887,"Convenient. It works both ways, lay down or up down. Right size and good color"
90305803,TV/Book Stand. Simple and sleek. Goes so well with our other furniture. Easy to put together.
30275861,Wow! Harder to find than Hamilton Tickets in DC. It took forever but I just received my Kallax shelves. I put them together and I’m more please with this item than my experience seeing Hamilton Kennedy Center!
70301537,Great storage for playroom. We are so happy to have so much storage for our kids playroom. Glad it comes with the proper accessories to attach the shelf to the wall. My husband was able to build it and put it in place in under an hour. Great buy for us!
30275861,Great features. I am so happy with the room i have to organize things
20278167,Great. This door adds beauty and function to my Kallax unit.
70301542,"Kallax black/brown shelf unit. I can't believe I've finally given in to Ikea, but after this shelf, I'm totally sold. This was the EASIEST and FASTEST shelf I've ever put together and it fit and works PERFECTLY. Worth every penny, and I'll be buying more. No more amazon for me. This is it. It's light, it comes in several boxes so you can move it upstairs or around the house without help, and everything is perfectly matched that you don't even need directions to put it together."
80275887,Perfect. Love this shelf unit. Was just what I wanted. Built very well.
20275885,". The perfect storage unit! I bought this specifically so I could store my 12x12 scrapbooks, but it does so much more! With all the insert options and cube bin designs, I can use this for just about anything."
60275812,Perfect size for a small area. This makes a perfect portion as well as storage in my granddaughters bedroom
60275812,Sturdy and fits my equipment. My PA fits perfectly and once I purchase the wheels it will be perfect for my needs.
20275885,. I’ve bought three of these in three different colors. Easy to put together and holds up great. Definitely worth the price.
70301542,Amazing product. I bought this a month ago and I love it! Easy to assemble has worked perfect for my homeschool classroom.
20213312,Great shelf. Really like this shelf. It’s pretty dang cute. Setting it up was a bit annoying for me. I messed up 1 thing and had to loosen almost the entire shelf to fix it so pay EXTRA close attention.
70339291,Great collection that fits our lifestyle. This is actually our third purchase from this collection. They're sturdy and look great in any room. Easily assembled by one person.
10275862,Sturdy and functional. We have two of the KALLAX Shelf units and they are great for storage. They are relatively easy to put together (need two people because they are heavy).
80275887,"Super Easy, Functional and Bright. Bought these to store all my art books in my home printmaking studio. Very easy to put together and they hold a lot of books! They also act as a really nice space divider!"
10305741,. Love the look and so useful
70342199,Great corner piece. It handled all my books!!!
20278167,Great door for the opening. Very happy with this product
60278170,"Graeat for protection. If you have items that need to be protected those inserts work great. I have a number of them. I use them to store and protect my photographic gear. Cheap, easy to install, flexible (you can move them at any time or you can add more if need it) and good looking. Recommended."
70301537,Fits in well. Been able to store my small items in one location in boxes for the cubes
20278167,"Nice looking, hard to install. The initial idea of installing this isn’t hard - the doors also look nice & is a great addition to my 4x2 unit. It’s figuring out the latches and actually getting the door to close without completely unscrewing them. A lot of times I thought the door would be screwed into the body and the door would pop off. It’s more me than the door, but still a bit hard. Overall, it’s a decent product."
40415601,3x3. Nice way to organize Nice to look at
09278338,"Lots of storage and display space!. This piece is fairly easy for 2 people to put together, and it provides lots of storage and display space in a fairly small footprint. So happy to have it in my eating area for my cookbooks, small art, and kitchen-related stuff!"
80275887,Great shelf unit!. This went together so easily and is so much sturdier than others that I looked at. It doesn’t wiggle or sway when you try to move it!
60278170,"Installation/Adjustment is a bit fiddly. Compared to to other IKEA furniture I've assembled, this one isn't quite as straightforward, and getting the door aligned so that it it is flush when closed is more difficult than I'd hoped."
20275814,"Bought two at the same time - one is heavier?. I bought two standard white 2x2 units during the after Christmas sale. Two boxes, stacked on top of one another. I had help loading and unloading my cart and vehicle, so I did not notice that one is marked 29lb and one is marked 42lb. Same item number, just a small 5 digit number to the side is one number off. I carried one box upstairs, assembled it, and then...could not pick up the second box. I'm not entirely sure what to do about this, or even what to think of it. I clicked through the different colors available on the website, and they, too, have inconsistent package weights listed at the time of writing this review, though none were as light as the 29lb model. Assembly of this lighter unit went about as well as expected, including the obligatory breaking of those little wooden dowels and having to scramble to find a suitable replacement in my collection of old baggies of extra Ikea hardware. I'm debating returning one or both units, and I will also be weighing my daughter's pink Kallax to see how those measure up. I guess the takeaway from this should be check the ENTIRE label, not just that the article numbers match up."
40275846,Excellent product. I used 2 of them on their sides as a coffee table and vinyl storage
20275814,"love this unit!. recently bought this unit. added wheels, drawers and a door to 2 of the cube areas. We are currently using it for additional space in our kitchen. Excellent choice as we can easily move it around."
80275887,great buy. I bought these as a tv stand. My is laying on the side. It has a wide top and can display item on top or under it. I did also buy the drawers and cubes to fit in it. look awesome
10409932,Just what we needed!. These bookshelves are exactly what we needed and I'm thrilled that they look so wonderful in my room. They are a contemporary solution to a necessity for a library
70301537,Lots of storage. Bought this for my mom’s craft storage. She loves it. Lots of room.
40415601,Inexpensive useful bookcase. Asssembly was easy (2 people). We bought the cat add on house with pillow to use in one slot. Has allowed us to remove two other smaller bookcases as it has a good amount of storage.
50214678,Nice. Very easy to put together
80275887,"Library shelves. In total, I have bought 3 of the 8-space units and 2 of the 4 space units. The 2 4 space units are stacked on 2 of the 8 space units for my library. Relatively easy to assemble. My only complaint was that 3 of the 5 units were missing 1 or 2 of the wooden dowels. I could have had some sent, but I was on a hurry to get this project done, so I cut up 5 1.7/8 pieces of 3/16 threaded steel rod I had, and used those. Worked fine! And they don't show. My books are contained in the shelves, 2 rows deep; and I still have room in the front for storing new books until I get them organized."
80275887,"Perfect for entry foyer console/storage. We use this shelf laid down horizontally on its side, as storage for our 4 kids bookbags, hats/gloves, etc at the house entry foyer and doubles as a console. SUGGESTION:  I wish the kit included something to cover up the screw holes (white stickers or small plastic caps) which you can see when you use it horizontally."
70342199,Nice product. i really like this unit but it arrived damage and I am still waiting for the replacement part to be shipped to me. it has been four weeks now
20275885,Perfect. We have several of these units they are very versatile.
00275848,"Very useful!!!. Great addition to the rest of the IKEA furniture, perfect match."
60278170,Bring back Expedit. Such a shame that the current market prefers cheaply made alternatives to what was previously offered.
20275885,Sturdy and spacious. This organizer is sturdy and the cubes are spacious compared to other organizers that only have 11 depth. Definotely recommend.
89275091,Solid shelves.. Easy to purchase and fits our needs well.
40303439,Great shelf but damaged. Love this shelf but when I opened the box one of the pieces was dented. I put it together since it wasn’t a huge dent but when I went to put the glass in it couldn’t lay flat because of the dent. Everything else was great but pretty disappointing as it was really perfect for my needs. The box showed no signs of damage and I live an hour from the store so just living with the dent.
00275848,Great value. Easy assembly
39285808,"Difficult to put together and didnt Include screws. I bought this about a month ago and out of the huge order I placed this was easily the most difficult product to put together. The boxes require that you beat on them (leaving dents) with a hammer to make sure you can get all four corners in and even then it is challenging. On top of that after we *finally* got the boxes together we starting putting the wall mounts on and found that they didn’t include the screws you need to mount it to the wall. Like what’s the point then? I had to go to Home Depot to buy the screws where I could have just bought everything I needed for the wall mount and ignored buying this from ikea. Honestly the worst experience I’ve ever had putting together ikea furniture, usually it takes 15-20 minutes it’s easy and it looks great but not this time. I would never buy this again"
20275814,"So glad I made this purchase. I purchased 2 Kallax Shelves for my toy store. They look great and gave us the additional shelving needed for our merchandise. In retail, presentation is everything"
10305741,"Staple piece. Love these cubby shelfs. We own three and they all work fabulously in our home, no matter how we choose to use them. My only qualm with this item particular it was not clearly labeled on the box that this was “glossy” when we wanted matte. Also, by the time we open the box and pieces it would’ve been too much work to exchange so we kept it."
20275814,Missing parts from a SEALED box. Always check parts before assembly! I've put so many pieces of furniture together I failed to do so. Got this 90% together before I realized the top was missing. Returned for a refund...too angry for a replacement!
90286649,"Wonderful!. So happy I got the drawer inserts, easy to install and use. Was hesitant at first because I’ve had issued with drawers before. No issues with these!"
80275887,Not as tall as past shelf. The shelf is great. The only problem we had is that the height is different from the same shelf we bought several years ago. We made it work but there is definitely a difference.
20275814,"A winner. Love this item. I use them everywhere. Tv consoles for my kids rooms, closet storage, and office storage!! This are so handy and the maximizes the storage space and also looks sleek."
90286649,"Works great, but consider it a permanent feature. I needed a couple of drawers for my keys and stuff that goes in my purse, these drawers work perfectly for that. Drawers fit great, no issues there. I just wish I didn't have to use screws to attach it to the main unit. If I ever remove this, there will be unsightly holes. Otherwise a great piece."
60221683,"Best budget bookshelves I've ever bought. I bought four of these two years ago, after a lifetime of buying inexpensive chipboard bookcases that sagged. I'm about to buy another one now that I have a bit more space. They are practical, very strong, easy to move (I just did that) and the shelves don't sag despite their long span. Really terrific for the price. I'm surprised they are not easier to find on the IKEA web site--I'd be promoting these heavily. Bonus: they are attractive white enamel."
80275887,Sturdy. Bought this and put a 55 tv on it and it's perfect. Very sturdy and heavy.
70339291,"Sturdy and looks good. I was hesitant to buy after seeing other reviews of being hard to assemble or missing/broke parts but I'm glad I ignored that and bought it. All the parts were in the box and correct with no damage. It only took an hour to put together. Not sure what these other people are doing where it takes hours or days, but this was easy to put together. Well built, sturdy and looking good! Try it, you'll like it too"
40346924,Great look!. These fit perfectly in our son’s apartment and matched his cabinets. They work so well!
60275812,Love this unit!. Very easy to assemble - very sturdy as well!
20275885,. It works great in our office
80275887,Great Shelf!. Works well for storage for my students!
60275812,"We have 6 of these!. We have 6 sets of these shelves in various colors and sizes, all with different uses. We stacked two in our mud room for storage, two in a play room, one in each kids’ rooms, and one in a home office. They’re durable and look great. We recommend tethering them to the wall if you have small kids."
20275814,"Mixed feelings. I had to return the unit I bought since I decided I didn't have the time to hack the unit from 2 to 1 rows. There is no Ikea unit that is 1 row, 2 columns with drawers insert. Also, I was going to purchase a 3 row, 4 column unit with muliple drawer units for a media center. However IKEA discontinued this size in birch finish."
20275885,Great Purchase. I bought this for my son toon easy to assemble
20275814,Easy to assemble. Looks nice and easy to assemble
70301542,"Tons of space!. To start off, when they say multi-man lift in the instructions, they mean it. This thing is a beast. The unit assembled similarly to all other Kallax units (I've done the 2x2 and the 2x4 units also). The challenge for this one was manhandling the unit to get everything to slot in properly.  I will say since the unit is so big, there does seem to be a bit of flex or wiggle in the unit, but since you're pretty much going to bolt it to the wall, it doesn't really matter. The amount of flex isn't much, so most probably wouldn't notice. I did need to use a hammer and a piece of scrap wood to tap things flush multiple times, especially with the final end piece. All in all, if you've put other Kallax pieces together in the past, this one is no surprise other than the sheer weight of the unit."
70339291,Beautiful. I love it is just perfect
19931865,Well made and very chic.. Bought 2 of these to place on a wall in my office. This is a well made piece of furniture. I love the soft close drawers and the fact that it is metal. I love how much I can display and also hide away!
20275885,Sturdy material. This is a nice TV stand for our guestroom. TV sits on top and the open spaces so our guest can use it as temporary storage. We placed it horizontally.
20213312,"Love the clean lines of the Vittsjo. Bought the Vittsjo shelf unit for my studio, I love the clean lines and height it brings to the room. Looks amazing in our space!"
80275887,"LOVE!!!. Our family loves our kallax shelving unit! We have 3 that we use in our homeschool room. They make amazing book shelves and the storage units provide space for toys, puzzles, etc. We also use them in our children's rooms and our bedroom."
70339291,"HORRIBLE TO ASSEMBLE. It's a beautiful piece of furniture, along with the whole collection But it was so hard to assemble. it took me 3 days. I'm not good at Ikea furniture,but out of the 3 pieces I bought, this was the hardest. Also, its not even fully assembled. the boards you place as shelving, come with screws to hold them in place...No clue how tiny screws are supposed to hold a thick board in place but okay...I don't know if I received wrong pieces, or the instructions were just confusing. It took 2 of us to attempt and a day later, it was still wrong so i went back the following 2 days to correct. It's still not assembled correctly, but it's sturdy."
20275885,"Sturdy well built. I bought these shelves to create a cubby wall in my son's play room. I have had other brands in the past. They don't even come close to these. Looks like a real piece of furniture, not storage cubbies."
10275862,Great. I brought this a month ago for my daughter room. It was very easy to assemble and it’s great to organize toys and clothes.
60275812,"Awesome shelf!. It’s high quality and it’s very durable, one of my best purchase ever, appearance looks great!"
80275887,Very sturdy!. I purchased this about a month ago as storage for my bathroom and I love it! It's just enough storage and was relatively easy to assemble.
60275812,Perfect cube. This is a perfect cube for storage and as a side table. Utilized in my office for hanging files
20213312,Nice display shelf. Bought this 3 mos ago and satisfied. Was able to assemble by myself.
00334536,Great shelf. I bought this for my classroom as extra storage and a place to set up my class technology. It's light weight and easy to slide around on the carpeted floor. It holds my class computer and teacher manuals. I'm a fan of IKEA products for my classroom!
20275885,"We use it as a TV stand. Have a 65 TV and stands are WAY overpriced. This works perfectly. If the shelves are too narrow, just remove one panel. Obviously, we put it on its side. Works great."
40415601,Love these shelves!. Just bought our third unit and thinking about a fourth.
19931865,"Minimal, elegant design. A nice shelving unit that fits into a wide variety of decors. A friend commented that it looks more expensive than the actual cost. Once assembled, it does have a slight wobble but when its mounted against the wall, its very secure and won't budge. I use it to hold paperbacks and light hardcover books and there is little to no bowing of the shelves. For heavier hardcover art books, I would recommend the smaller Fjalkinge unit. The drawers are spacious and glide easily and I like that I can add more drawers or shelves in the future, if needed. I've had this unit for about 2 years with no problems."
59902658,"light and airy. Got this a month ago. Got three sets for a full wall of shelving. It is so light and airy looking, and light passes through, so the space still looks big. Supports bins and books. Easy to keep clean. Need two people to assemble for ease."
60333954,"Revised review. I wrote a 1-star review that was strongly critical, in part, of what I regarded a near-impossible assembly requirements, noting that I have woodworking skills. Well, last night, after closely reviewing the assembly instructions over and over I realized that the assembly issues were my own fault. I still can't explain the issues with one of the three cabinets, but the issues with the other cabinet were because, when I assembled the cabinet, before the last piece was to be attached, I had (essentially) a C configuration, with piece 1 at the top of the C, where I should have had an upside down U configuration, with piece 1 at the top of the upside down U. I'm sure this makes no sense without the instructions. But what I can say is that, when I had the cabinet in the proper upside down U position, the last piece attached easily, without the problems I had been having. I therefore believe I caused the problem, and I caution anyone else building the cabinets to be very attentive to the specifics of the assembly instructions and to not attempt to attach the final piece unless and until the cabinet is in the proper upside down U position with piece 1 at the top of that upside down U."
80275887,Very sturdy. I bought one for my daughter’s room to display all her Lego sets and it is a beautiful addition to her room. Not too big and very sturdy also very easy to put together.
50214678,"Love everything about these shelves!. The look, the quality of the construction, the metal finish, the glass quality. They even have a knob system under each leg so you stabilize them on non level floors! Nice size for displaying objects too! I am an art reacher and use them for student displays."
70301542,"Great Shelf. I bought this shelf to put in my new craft room, mostly to hold scrapbook paper and supplies. I had never seen a 5 squares by 5 squares unit and just had to have this one. It makes a statement in my room, is super handy and great for storage. I bought a dozen of the cloth bins to put supplies in and could not be happier with this shelf unit."
20275814,Perfect for my albums and easy to assemble.. It was easy to assemble — I had it completed within 45 mins. It's sturdy and great storage for albums.
50339292,Up to date look!. Attractive storage at an affordable price.
70342199,"Great Look!. This is second piece we bought and we love the look, very sturdy but minimalistic design."
20275885,Good basic shelf. Easy to assemble - does the job.
30275861,Closet makeover. I was able to totally reorganize my master bedroom closet. I saved thousands of dollars with this simple and efficient system.
10275862,Great Features!. We purchased this to store our granddaughter's toys. It fits perfect in the den added a couple of pictures in the cubbies and it looks great!
40346924,"4x2 or 2x4 Kallax Storage Unit. We took two home and arranged one tall next to one wide. It makes a handsome wall unit: Books for us, maybe a TV and etc for you. The color choices pleased us; we got the gray and wood grain."
40303439,A bit wobbly. This is a fine unit for the price. I'd like to have seen white screw heads since they can be seen. It racks side to side unless screwed into a wall on both top sides. Which is fine unless you are placing it in an area that you can't do that.
20275885,"Very versatile!. I now have four of these is various sizes and I use the as dressers, storage in craft room and love them!!"
40415601,Love these! Very sturdy!. Exactly what I thought they’d be like! Sturdsg. Too.
79278269,Great size and features. Bought to organize my office.
20275814,Awesome addition to my closet. Paired with a wine insert to store all my sandals. Now I can locate all my shoes and other items in addition to it looking nice.
39278290,Looks amazing. Great chair very simple to put together assembled in less than 10 minutes
80275887,Perfect size. This is the perfect size to hold my 12 x 12 albums for my grandchildren scrapbooks. It’s beautiful to see when you walk into my Craft Room.
80275887,. Looks very nice! I Can storage many things and everything is organized
60275812,"Bookshef. Needed some storage, bookshelf matches the color of my desk exactly."
60333954,"Difficult to assemble, cheap material. We are so disappointed with this shelf. We have purchased many other pieces from Ikea that appeared more difficult to assemble, but this shelf was by far the worst. We thought it would be a piece of cake but boy were we wrong. The pieces simply would not go together correctly, and the wood chipped away in places. We followed the directions and took our time, I swear our pieces had to be flawed. If our IKEA store wasn’t so far away, we would have definitely returned it. However, it is over an hour drive. Sadly we went to IKEA for this shelf (and lunch in the food court!) only. What a wasted day. The shelf was intended for organizing my daughter’s closet. We ended up assembling it without the back ( it was the only way we could get the pieces to fit together.). It is chipped in places which disappoints me. I felt it was a little pricey for IKEA to begin with, but the dimensions were spot on for our needs. I am very disappointed with how it all turned out though. I like IKEA shelves and storage just NOT this piece."
00415599,Kallax. Just what I needed to hold several Threshold & Pillowfort bins from Target. Only knocked off one star because it's a bear to get assembled solo.
90286649,Looks and works great. I only took off a point because it was hard to get the screws into the kallax boards. I don't know how I would've gotten it done if I didn't have a power screwdriver.
60333954,Perfect!. Bought these a month ago and love them. They are sturdy and went together very easy..
40415192,. We put one on each side of the bed to provide shelves in a small bedroom.
20275885,Great little shelf!. This is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to put together and looks awesome! My son will get years of use out of it!
70301542,Great Bookshelves. We love this bookshelf! Easy to put together.9
60275812,This is an addition piece. This is an addition piece to the larger version of the unit. It looks great and is perfect for displaying my collection of cowboy and western knik knacks.
80275887,Favorite storage solution. We have purchased 4 Kallaxes. They’re the perfect storage piece and doubles as a nightstand for my kids.
10409932,Very sturdy. Bought this last month for my teen daughter's room. Seems very sturdy and holds a lot of her stuff. Thinking about buying another for our craft room.
20275885,"Versatile. Bought this for a family member that needed storage in a small space. Placed it horizontal on the floor and added cloth bins across the bottom. It looks great, got a bunch of stuff off the floor with some items hidden inside the bins. She loves it."
20275814,"So many uses. I have this line in all the different size variations. They are sleek and easy to move. The assembly is super straight forward. The size of the cubes is universal for the baskets and bins not just found at IKEA, but anywhere."
70332124,Easy Peasy. Easy to use and put up shelving instead of bedroom side-tables.
20275885,Perfect!. I needed another cabinet for the living room and this fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to assemble and looks great.
40275846,"Good storage. I like these cube storage systems. You can stand it up or lay it on its side. I have used them as a bench, I have put them in a closet, I use one as a make up stand, all the different configurations are wonderful. Very sturdy and well made lasts a very long time"
80303437,". I wish I could move/space the shelves as I wish, and there were a couple scratches on the frame/shelves. Other than that - exactly what I was looking for."
80334603,"Can’t believe these are extremely hard to assemble. Just as other reviews have stated, these cubes require a lot of force up to the point that you’re splitting the wood. I have bought 10 of these and every single side of each one was extremely hard to connect together. The first three sides were okay but once you put that back panel in... that fourth side will not go in at all! The holes are not drilled into properly making assembly such a difficult process. Plastic connectors break so easily as well. Horrible quality. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
40346924,. I got the shelfs and like the way they went together and it's a space saver
60275812,Shelf Unit. Love the clean look of the shelf unit. I used it as a replacement of a TV stand that I removed and it is perfect.
60333954,"Poor instructive sketches. The drawing was hard to understand given what was in the box. Would have been less frustrating if the pieces had been marked by numbers/letters and then identified in assembly sketches. Certainnif the pre-drilled holes were off-center, requiring strenuous effort to attach. Such a simple piece, but too many complications."
70339291,Love it. Happy with it and easy to build!
00275848,Organization On A Different Level. This is my 5th Kallax purchase and I truly couldn't be happier with this one...It is definitely a wonderful addition to my craft space!!!!...
39278290,"Great Features, Sleek style. I love this furniture. It's stronger than other furniture I have bought at Ikea. Assembling is so easy and elegant furniture, a lot of storage."
20275814,"Kallax Shelf Unit. Very impressed with this one. The fit/finish is great, very solid/sturdy and only $35 bucks... Its also not too heavy so it can be moved easily."
20275885,Great fir organization. I bought the larger one last year for our childs room to keep his toy and books organized. We need an one and I got this one to lay on its side so he could put stuff on top. They hold a lot and are very durable. Will buy more when needed.
40346924,Nice storage piece. Very functional.. Very versatile and functional storage unit.
20409936,Easy to put together.. I'm happy I purchased this. It's great for organizing my sewing studio.
60275812,Storage bin. This product is very sturdy and looks great!
10409932,"Looks Great. This looks great in any decor, I would love to ikeatize my whole house which it is almost already. But ikea is fantastic and highly recommend this for anyone."
50339292,"Perfect shelving unit!. Looks great in our livingroom, exactly what we were looking for!"
20275814,Large cubes are excellant at hiding clutter. This product helps out my very small closet. Great to organize my life.
30275861,"Easy to put together!. I bought the Kallex units to assist me in getting my craft room organized. I'm loving it so far. It was very easy to put together, instructions, as usual, are easy to understand and all parts are there. Kudos on another great piece!"
10275862,not stable. the product is not stable once you have it installed.
20275885,"Perfect as a TV stand that is tall.. Easy to put together, looks great versatile."
49275088,"Buy with Confidence. We needed a long wall filled..purchased 2 of these , HAVSTA Cabinet with solid wood sliding doors, and 2 HAVSTA Glass-door cabinet with base ...easy to assemble, beautiful wood texture, everything is solid! It looks awesome!!!"
40346924,Toy shelf. I love love love this. We use it as a toy shelf in our living room and it is so neat and organized. We also got the matching gray storage boxes for the four bottom shelves.
80275887,"like the white. easy to setup, good size, sturdy"
40415601,Great Value. Purchase this item about 1 month ago and am please with the ease of putting it together. and the quality of the product.
70339291,"Nice Proportion for Smaller Areas. Using this 4-tier shelf in conjunction with the same-series TV/entertainment stand creates a ""perfect-fit"" solution on a 9 ft (3 m) wall-space. The open shelves allow creativity for curating a custom display, while the enclosed doors of the TV entertainment stand offers storage flexibility -- all without the overpowering presence of larger pieces generally available from other sources. Assembly does require close attention to detail, but overall, quite easy."
20409936,Great for organizing!. I bought this to help organize my Scentsy business supplies and I was able to place everything and still had space left!
10345073,Definitely will buy more!. This basket fits perfectly in the Kallax system. It splits the space up so you can have more on display and looks great too. This basket is sturdy and beautiful.
20278167,Great inserts !. Went in to the bookcase with ease!
80334603,This is not as simple as it looks. We have bought and constructed MANY Ikea products in different cities and countries and this one confounded us which only maddened us as it SEEMS so simple. It is NOT. We could not get the cube square which would defy Rubik. It is by far the simplest product we have ever bought from Ikea and it gave us the most trouble. There are two depths of this product and it seems very utile. They need to redo the instructions.
10305802,Exact What I needed!. We bought this for our new record player and it is exactly what we needed! Sturdy and very nice looking!
10275862,. Used with table set up we saw on display. Perfect for my son’s college apartment.
20275885,. Great! Very sturdy. Exactly what I ssnted
90286649,"Clever Design. Bought this as a storage amendment to my Kallax. It fits the bill perfectly in terms of space, integration with existing unit and reasonable assembly effort. The drawers are not very deep but still very functional. They also have a short pull out length. Still they are very good for adding storage and privacy to a Kallax. Recommended."
20275885,Quick and easy to build. Incredibly sturdy!. My husband and I put this together in under 20 minutes. Was exactly what we were looking for for our basement. Shelves are really sturdy and thick enough to where I don't anticipate them bending like other inexpensive shelves have a tendency to do. Fits our space great. Will likely buy a second!
80275887,Perfect for the space!. Love this unit. Bought it last month and it works perfectly in my closet.
20275885,. THIS IS A GREAT SHELVING UNIT & COMPLEMENTS THE ROOM
10345073,"Love this SO much. Wow I never realized I needed this, my husband brought it home for me and I wasn’t that excited. I was SO wrong!! This gold basket is beautiful. I use it in my Kallax to store vinyl in my craft room and it’s perfect. I am SO happy about this product and I will definitely be getting a few more next time we go to the store."
20275814,Love this shelf!. I love the price & quality of this shelf! I can't find the same quality for this price at Walmart or Target. Highly recommend!
80275887,So easy to assemble!. Love this unit I bought 2 laid them on the side put legs and an island top sewing room cutting table. A 3rd unit stands verticals and holds fabric.
70286645,"Great for what you need it for. Fits prefectly in the cubbies, easy installation too!"
50214678,. Brought this and happy I did works as extra storage for collections etc.
20275885,I love the look and. I love the look and quality.
70342199,"Good looking and sturdy. This shelf is in my home office, and I use it to my printer, Wi-Fi router, and a free other items. It's very sturdy, was easy to assemble, and looks good. If you are looking for a book shelf, this might not be the best, as the shelves are not adjustable and widely spaced."
70286645,"Easy to assemble and look amazing. These are in my kallax, which I made into a bar. They were easy to assemble and have a lot of room. They are sturdy and look great. Perfect for my bar accessories."
20213312,"Easy to assemble. Bought this last month, it was a breeze to assemble and very stable even on my tile floor."
20275885,"nice shelf, very fragile. This is a great looking shelf, but the veneer is very fragile. DO NOT use a hammer or mallet when assembling. Body weight to push the shelves together worked."
60275812,. Good furniture for my craft room
00275848,"Makeshift Lingerie Dresser. Great price compared to similar products at other retailers and far sturdier than ones I've tested. Since they stopped making the Hemnes lingerie dresser, I needed something when we replaced out bedroom set. This is working as a great temporary fix with fabric bins. It is one of the easiest IKEA pieces to assemble and is a quick build. The veneer feels fragile and like any movement or touch will scratch it. However, it's right for the price and offers are far stronger piece than competitors."
50339292,Love this!. I purchased this for my kitchen. I put my microwave and and a few other small appliances. I use the bottom to store kitchen towels and such.
70339291,"Sturdy, minimal industrial look. The minimal, industrial look of this shelf unit doesn't look overbearing in my small apartment. The satin, slightly textured black finish of the metal is well done. The wood shelves are solid pine wood with a rustic looking stain. Once the feet are adjusted and the unit level with the floor, it becomes very sturdy even if you don't screw it into the wall (which I would do for safety, especially if you have kids or pets). Assembly of this unit can be tedious and took me about 3 hours to get together. For example, in step 6 of the assembly instructions, the hole at the middle vertical bar was tight and you might need to open it up a bit by turning the screw a few times before assembling the bottom shelf to it. Even then, you have little leeway to turn the screwdriver; go slowly so you don't strip the screw head. Also, for step 9, one of the small jutting bars of the side frame that connects to the bottom shelf was welded with a hair's width of misalignment. In order for the pieces to fit together, I had to nudge it by lightly tapping it using a hammer covered with a protective cap. You may need to touch up any screw heads with black marker or paint if you scraped off the finish with the screwdriver. What would make this look even better? A crossbar for the back might add extra sturdiness. The same goes for the sides; either a crossbar or mesh sheet similar to the bottom shelf could keep books from sliding out. Otherwise, a nice looking and inexpensive take on industrial shelving."
70301537,Great storage!!. I bought this about a month ago and it is an amazing product and is exactly what I was looking for. It holds all my kids toys and also serves as a room divider! I highly recommend!!!
40346924,. Love the grey color. Perfect size for my kids' rooms.
80275887,Quality is hit and miss. I bought 4 of these units. 3 were made of great material that will hold up well. One of them is made from a cheaper material and was easily damaged on the edges and by the pegs that hold it together. Not satisfied with it from the get go and we will have to carefully weigh weather we buy from IKEA again and if we do we must consider the longevity of the product.
20275885,. I love the cube holes i use as a tv stand
50334591,"Perfect for vinyl storage. I am 67 years old the first one went together easy as pie for some reason I had a harder time with the second two but my daughter was able to put them together and I am very satisfied with them, they are perfect for my record collection"
29278304,"This looks like an expensive piece of furniture.. Love it, very versatile. Quality piece."
70301542,"Perfect for a studio apartment!. Kallax is a great to make a barrier for a studio space. We used it in my mother’s assisted living apartment and it’s made a wonder division of spaces. Easy to put together, clean and modern. Fun to design unique shapes."
10305741,Great for sewing room. Bought these as storage for sewing room. Put on a top and wheels. Works great
10409932,Great storage at a great price. I bought this unit for my art studio and love all the storage and display space. Now I realize I could use a second one in our family room for storage of books and games.
70286645,Great product. Goes together exactly as shown.
90286649,"Great featurea. 3 out of the 4 I bought were excellent sliding smooth, true and easy to install. But one of had a river that was broken off inside the box."
20275885,Sturdy Divider!. I bought this for extra storage and I love it!
20275814,"love the storage. I bought these in Dec for my craft room, love all the storage room in them"
30275861,. We bought this a month ago and it is perfect for my sewing room.
30275861,"Good shelf unit to keep your house organized. We bought this to organize our clothes in the closet as it's much cheaper than anything else. Works perfectly fine for our purpose. The wood came with some small defects, which was really annoying, but we didn't botter to take it back and exchange the product. It's much stronger and more stable than the competitors' products (Walmart and Target), so I recommend it."
20275814,"Love this staple!. We originally bought one for our daughters dorm room, it was such a great storage unit that we went back and got a second one."
20409936,"Perfect for our retail displays!. We found out at the store that this unit can be used in either orientation 4 high or 3 high, so it's very versatile for our needs."
10275862,"Great item, could be even better with minor tweaks. We bought this item to replace a bookshelf and a TV stand and were very pleased with the overall results. The TV on top is out of the way but still watchable for our little kids. The storage below with bins makes our living room look significantly more organized. Our bin storage ranges from kids' toys and DVD's to new tissue boxes and new paper towel rolls. We considered the 5 x 5, but are very happy with this option instead. It was also a bonus that assembly was simple. The only minor tweaks which would make this unit better: 1 Add a slight cut-in at the bottom for baseboards. Attaching to the wall for safety is cumbersome when it sticks out so far because of floor trim. Other units have such a cut-in to make things more home-friendly. 2. Add an optional, additional matching color, box-bin with a front cabinet door. It could latch in the back to stay stationary, but allow for more customization. Overall: Great shelf unit."
10305741,Many functional uses. Bought it be use as a dresser and tv stand. Works great!
70301542,"Sturdy and looks good. I bought it about a month ago for the playroom. It looks great, is sturdy and accommodates all the toys, books and studies. Very happy with it!"
30275861,Perfect toy storage. This is great for toy storage in a play room. I added the cloth bins and it made the room look clean and organized. It was large but easy to assemble.
30275861,. I’m not happy at all Do not recommend y
80303437,"Nice Looking shelf unit. Love the glass shelves, adds some airiness in a low light room."
70301537,"The assembling is not as easy as other IKEA products. I have been a loyalty IKEA customer for decades and I had assembled at least 30+ IKEA furniture all by myself successfully until I met the KALLAX 5*5 Shelf unit. I am not sure if it is just me or the product that I received. It seems that all 4 side boards in my packages don't have holes deep enough to hold the wooden pegs. I tried everything to make it right, finally chose to drill the hole more deeper and hammered the pegs to make it shorter, and eventually the pieces were put together. However, there are still ugly gaps in both sides through which I can see some peg parts, plus there are bumps on the side boards now as I tried to hammer them together from the board sides. Very frustrating! AND the piece is too large to be taken apart for return."
60275812,Solid and easy to install. Bought 2 and it was super easy to install.
40415601,"Very functional. I purchased a larger unit like this one 15 years ago, but it was called Expedit. That unit served me well so I searched the IKEA site and found Kallax. It seems this product has changed names. I use this unit to store my card making supplies. I even purchased a couple of the storage boxes that fit in the unit as well. I am always asked where I purchased it. I also fits in with any decor I have placed it in. It is well worth the money spent for it."
20275885,Awesome. Got this a month ago and it is perfect. Using it in my sewing room to hold my fabric.
00415599,Sturdy and Stylish. A little tricky to put together without damaging the veneer (use a flat block) but looks great and is functional.
80275887,". These two units lying on their sides create a wonderful craft table. Initially I purchased the Fromm top but it was too small. Instead I purchased a plastic cutting pad from Joann Fabrics and used double sided tape to adhere it to the surface. Mounted on a plywood base with three sets of casters, it’s totally mobile."
20409936,"Love the style. I Bought this awhile ago and I love the look, has lots of storage space. I love love it"
30275861,Love it!. I bought this to organize my sewing room. I love the clean look!
80275887,Makes a great toy chest!. I purchased the 8 compartment & the 4 compartment KALLAX Shefl unit. Placed the 8 compartment unit on its side & the 4 compartment vertically. This makes an amazing place to store the toys I have at my home for my grandsons!
70286645,"Kallax Drawers. I love these Kallax insert drawers! Simple instructions and I was able to put them together myself with just a screwdriver and a hammer. They all lined up great in the Kallas cabinet, roll smoothly and are a nice depth. I use them in my craft room for rubber stamps. I need to buy more!"
20275885,"Great organizer. Bought this to organize kids toys, fits the bigger bins and its great quality! Great purchase!"
30275861,Easy assembly. It totally organized the room.. Great addition for getting a room organized!
10409932,Great Organizer. Easy to assemble. I organized my clothes using the shelf unit.
90286649,Fits perfect. Great quality and fits perfectly on my kallax
70301537,Great shelf. I love the kallax series of shelves. I have bought several and loved every one of them
40346924,Great shelf. We really like these shelves. We have them all over the place.
70342199,". I purchased this item a month ago. I had been looking for a unit to use as a plant stand. This works perfectly and looks good in my kitchen. My son helpfully assembled it, although very tired, which might have contributed to the difficulty he experienced."
80275887,Sturdy and practical!. This is our second Kallax shelf unit! Very happy with it!
30275861,Great Unit. I bought this unit a month ago for my new apartment and I do like it. It is not as sturdy as I would like but it definitely works for me. Keeps all my clothing and items nice and organized and I use it instead of a dresser. It was a pain to put together though. I would have preferred some screws holding the shelves together instead of only dowels and including some extra dowels would be much appreciated. It really is a 3 person job so beware but other than that so far so good!
00415599,Absolutely love these!. Our large family loves the Kallax shelves. We have several units. I have 2 for our family closet and some for bedroom storage/organization.
70342199,Gorgeous!. I'm using this in my bathroom. It's the perfect size for larger towels and holds several baskets for other items. It fits perfectly with my decor.
49306872,Good product. Good product
30275861,Perfect item!!!. I so happy fitting good on my living room and it's a nice storage for my kids toys will recommend 100%. !
40314640,Good feature!. Works well for hiding things.
40334558,"Built our own wall unit. Love these! All of the multi-cube units were out of stock so we bought what was available and created our own 10 cube, wall-hung storage unit. Yes, you have to be careful about assembly (do it on a rug or the front of the cubes will get scratched) and measuring/marking the hanging location. But the final product was excellent and super cost-effective"
20278167,"Easy installation, door price bit high. It is a nice piece but with doors overall price a bit high."
70301537,Great organizer. I had 4 cubic shelves and this is the 5th one. I love these!!
80275887,Sturdy shelving. Bought 2 of these to put horizontally instead of vertically to make a large crafting table for my sewing room. Got the baskets to go with it and put coasters on the bottom for ease of moving. Love it.
70286645,Great feature!. I bought four of these and I love them! They made organizing my craft supplies so much easier!
60275812,"perfect for my wife's home office.. bought to store files and put printer on,it is very solid"
70301537,SOLID SHELVING.. I want another one! Wished they made this size in glossy white!
40314640,"Made a huge change! Love it!. These doors along with the double drawers made a huge change to our storage system. We bought a new house and I wanted our kids toy area to feel clean and organized. We ended up buying six of these doors and two of the double drawers. Kind of expensive once you add them all up, but worth every penny!"
60278170,Pretty ok!. General construction was easy enough. Installing it into the unit was less easy but still not rocket science.
80275887,great for a kids room. easy to assemble. we got 2 of them
40346924,"Roomy cubbies, simple assembly!. I put together my first two Kallax (2x4) shelves (all by myself!) in about 90 leisurely minutes. I'm pleased with the overall simplicity of assembly! I read in another review that a rubber mallet can come in handy for pushing together pieces. When I wasn't hammering, I just held the shelving with my hands and nudged it with my rubber-soled, non-marking combat boots...for me, this worked beautifully (and the shelf remained absolutely undamaged). All the parts fit together flawlessly. I assembled it atop a carpeted surface and would recommend this. The hardest part of the entire shelving experience was taking the boxes off the shelf at IKEA—because they were heavier than I'd expected—but the kind IKEA staff helped me put them on my cart, and another staff member helped me load them into my vehicle. Easy Peasy!"
80401292,Perfect. I use the kallax system as a cutting table and fabric storage. This piece is perfect for holding scraps and other small items. Very versatile.
60275812,Very well made.... Bought ours over 3 weeks ago. We really enjoy it!
20275814,Very flexible use and well made. The shelves look amazing with boxes of all colors for our Toddler
10275862,. Worked perfectly to take the place of old worn out book cases.
30275861,"Just right for our space. We looked at other possibilities, and this product was the best for the cost. We had a little difficulty with assembling, but I think it was because we didn't look at the illustrations closely enough. Other than that, this unit is perfect for what we needed."
50305739,"Just what we needed. Thought this would be perfect for our vinyl album collection, and we were right! Love them"
50339292,Absolutely love it!. Love the way it looks in our kitchen!
80275887,"Perfect entryway storage!. I bought this piece, which I use horizontally. It's perfect in my entry hall. I added bins to hide everything - very tidy. Assembly was possible to do alone. Love the glossy white!"
30275861,"Problem Solver. We bought this to solve a space/table problem. Every table we have ever placed in our breakfast nook has been a bust. We needed something where we could stash grandkid's backpacks, colors and crafts, all sorts of things. With the boxes this organizes a lot of things that would take over kitchen junk drawers, got the kiddos projects off the dining room table, opened up a small space that is usually overwhelmed by standard dining tables. It was a great choice."
00275848,"Record album storage. After searching high and low through multiple websites, I finally found the perfect affordable shelf unit for all my old record albums from a blog. Fits perfectly and took up a small space. Very happy with my purchase and was not hard to put together."
30275861,"Exactly what I asked for.. I bought this for storage for a sewing/craft area in my basement. I bought the high-gloss white, which looks very classy. I decked it out with four sets of drawers and 4 doors (in high-gloss turquoise-gray) in the top two rows, opting to put fabric bins in the rest. The important thing to note is that the installation of the drawers and doors took longer than assembling the unit itself. Tons of storage nicely hidden now. Am thinking of putting a 2x4 Kallax on top for even more places to hide stuff. Buying on sale at Friends & Family pricing makes this even more attractive. This isn't museum quality, but it's sturdy, useful, and meets the price point for what I'm using it for."
50214678,"Great bookcase. Great bookcase, easy to put together."
50339292,Great Shelf. We used ours for game and record storage in our common area of the house. Perfect & super easy to build!
00275848,Great for small spaces!. I bought this for storage for my craft room. I had a small space and this fit perfectly and gave me the storage that I needed for my craft business.
20275814,"Perfect side table. Purchased this and added two sets of drawers and two Doors, using as a Lamp table beside my recliner. It’s perfect, not too big not too small and the drawers give me access to everything I need yet keep my space looking neat and tidy."
00388633,Love. Love love love . The finish is more satine than gloss but if we have to we can just paint them. And yes it’s real wood .
40415601,Great unit for organizing!. My stacks of music are now sorted in baskets in my KALLAX shelf unit. Love it!
30275861,"Everything you need to get your toys organized.. I love my Kallax shelf unit. IKEA dropped its price so I got it few months ago for $109. My son toys are always organized, boxes are so big. I bought few inserts and I am really happy to have Kallax unit."
50339292,"so handsome. What an amazing piece, strong, durable and stylish.."
20275885,Versatile. Works great for my cookbooks
80275887,Good deal. This was in the damaged department. Put the damaged part against the wall so it's not noticeable. Great deal because of the discount. Already assembled.
70286645,I love this!. Very functional with the shelving and easy to assemble.
20275814,Easy to build. My 16 year old daughter build two of these in less than an hour. We bought the drawers for it as well. Great look
80275887,Just what we needed. Perfect for kid’s toy storage
99017445,Best Buy Ever!!!!. This is my third Kallax purchase and I love them all!!!!
80275887,Great for organizing sewing fabric. Bought to organize sewing room.
40275846,Kallax. I wish the storage boxes that go with kallax were in stock. I try every day and no luck.
20213312,"Simple but elegant. I bought this a month ago and I am very satisfied with this product. It's very simple looking but at the same time very elegant. It is also very easy to assemble, you can set it up in just a few minutes."
60278170,Hard to put together. Extremely hard to put together. It took over an hr to make sure it lined up perfectly.
20275885,"Perfect For Vinyl Records!. I have around 400 vinyl record albums and this shelf unit is perfect for storing them. Great value, easy to assemble and an attractive,"
70342199,. Nice shelf for the money. Easy to assemble. Handy leveling feet. Nice industrial feel.
20409936,Just perfect!. We bought this for our basement reno and it is just perfect! We love it!
50214678,"Perfect bedroom shelf unit. This is a great shelf unit for anyone who is looking for something to help make their room pop with statement piece but with minimal clutter on shelves! You'll actually want arrange books, and statement pieces. It is great for us who aren't the best at interior decoration (any decoration really), and change your mind 50 times in 20 seconds."
50334591,Cubes of love. A perfect extension for vinyl lovers
50334591,Nice cube. Added to my star wars display wall. Looks great along with all other eket shelves.
10305741,"Awesome Kid Storage. We got this in white for our 9-year-old's room, and it has been a great use of space. We have it set horizontally. It is extremely sturdy, and there is no confusion as to why this is a well-known favorite IKEA staple. It holds his books, some toys (action figures and their vehicles in Drona boxes), and has a huge surface on top to showcase his favorite treasures. We plan on getting it for our younger son's room as well."
10409932,"Great product. I put this together and have loved them in the past, little worried about the light weight construction especially since I am using it for books, but it works great. Only down side is the limited ability to purchase cubby containers since this unit is designed for a bigger set then other units 13x13x15 and are only available from 1 company."
50339292,"Looks Great!. Very solid piece of furniture. It assembled very quickly and easily. My one wish is that there would be a back side to the cabinet area. It works well for charging things because it is open, however you can push things out the backside on accident. It looks great in the area we have it and we're very pleased with the item."
60275812,"Easy, practical and clean lines. Easy to put together. Looks great and serves its purpose"
20409936,"Love it!!. I picked it up myself but asked the Ikea garage attendant to help me put it in my trunk, he was very nice and happy to assist me. I walked the boxes one at a time into my elevator easily and put it together by myself. It has a lot of room with the good size cubicles and containers that fit great."
60221683,Love these shelves. Bought two for a den - holds a ton of books and many decorative items
70339291,"sturdy shelf. Pros: sturdy shelf, wide enough to put board games on, somewhat easy to put together (pay attention to details) Cons: bar in middle of shelf can get in the way in some instances."
60275812,. Love it. Put it under my cutting table in my sewing room for organizing my projects. I plan to buy another for the other side of my cutting table next time I visit Utah.
40303439,"Elegant. One of the nicer shelving that IKEA sells. It's elegant and is sturdy and a good value. The glass shelves are tempered. Easy to put together. Goes with all kinds of decor because it's so simple, yet it doesn't look cheap."
40346924,Awesome buy. Awesome buy
09275085,Great item. Worked out perfect in my sons room
60275812,Perfect. Bought it to hold my inventory. Works great. Bought more
10409932,"Fantastic. Best shelf unit, exactly what I wanted. Has a lot of storage space! Rooms look more neat and clean."
30275861,Good kallax shelf. I bought it last month and it’s great
00334536,"Worst Design Ever!!!. Like some others, I registered just to write this review. This piece is the worst design of anything I've ever encountered at IKEA. I just bought two of them and have bene through an ordeal trying to get them to assemble properly. The first one required that I trim about an 1/8 inch off the back in order for the final side piece to fit in, but this was only after struggling mightily with it for a while and damaging the wood in the process. Two things have to happen at once for the last piece to fit in. The pegs have to line up, and the back piece has to be in the grooves of the other sides. This would require bending both time and space. On the second cabinet I snapped one of the shoddy plastic pegs with light pressure and then while the super glue to fix it was drying on that, I snapped 3 more pegs just trying to move the stupid thing out of the way. It's like they are made out of Derrick Rose's knees.  Just an awful design, a horrible experience, and makes me seriously question IKEA's (and Sweden's) commitment to quality. There are 4 stars reviews on here where they clearly say they had to leave the back off the cabinet. How can you give a 4 star review if there is a major piece that doesn't fit? That's insane. If I didn't want a back on it, I would have bought the Kallax."
40275846,Surprised. Pleasantly surprised by the wood grain appearance. Not surprised by the quality and value.
50481172,Basic. Basic quality stand used for many purposes. I used mines to hold most of my house plants. Not very sturdy as I expected however I like the style and color of it a lot. Took a little longer to put together but at least the instructions are easy to follow.
80275887,. I love the shelves it Helps organize anything you want
20278167,Great product. Product completes Kallax shelf unit.
70286645,great product. Works great in the center cabinet I put together using 3 kallax cubes.
40275846,Amazing. Im so happy this product is amazing
99306860,Awesome Organizational Tool. I purchased this piece to put sweatshirts in to keep them better organized and neater. It works great and exceeds my expectations in both functionality and appearance.
10275862,"Exception proves the rule. I have 7 of the Kallax shelve in my home in different sizes, 3 in just the 57x57. I have LOVED these shelves as they have worked beautifuly, coming in different sizes and colours. The closest IKEA store is an hour and a half away so when I happened to pass by it on the end of my trip yesterday I just had to get another! The box it came in was pristine but on opening it to put it together one of the internal pieces was damaged with a deep dent bigger than a quarter and unable to hide if I put it together. After an hour on the phone with customer service due to the size a repacement piece can not be sent my only options are to drive the 1.5h to either swap out the shelf/whole box, to return it... Or to deal with it. So in short its generally a great product, but if you aren't near an IKEA you run the risk of having your day ruined by an eye-sore that makes the products statement looks great from any angle completely false."
60275812,. Bought this product works great
00275848,Fantastic!. Perfect little bench! Holds toys/books inside the cubbies and even on top. Can be used as a sitting bench for little kids.
00314642,"Perfect fit!. These drawers feel smooth when you open them! They make a great addition to my cube storage furniture! I’ve already bought 4 sets! Plus, they’re easy to install!"
39285827,Just what I envisioned. I bought three of these in different colors to use near a small desk. I love the way that they turned out. Fairly simple to put together. I hung on the wall and that too was simple. But WARNING - follow the directions exactly in order!! If you do not the box will not fit together and You cannot undo the mistake. I broke one box that way
30275861,perfect for records. I bought this for my record collection and it is perfect. Everything fit nicely.
70301537,Great Organizer. I purchased this to organize a spare bedroom. It holds so much that I have a few empty cubes! It looks so nice. Very clean. I love it.
60333954,"Not hard if you can read and follow directions. We bought four of these for use by our children for toy and book storage. They are not difficult to put together if you read and follow the directions. You must start with piece 1! If you don't, the last piece will be impossible to put in. You must go in order. Do all of this and you'll have a wonderfully sturdy cabinet. Mounting on the wall was not too hard either. Cabinets look great!"
90305803,. I am so happy with my VITTSJO Shelt Unit
80275887,My entertainment center. I laid this down and am using it as a tv entertainment center.
00275848,Versatile!. We have multiple Kallax units in our home! The colored ones are easy to keep clean. They look good standing vertical and horizontal and are easy to assemble!
70342199,. Outstanding and fits with my others
20213312,Simple but efficient. I set this up by myself with no issues. Works fantastic.
80275887,Kallax shelf. We bought this for my wife’s craft room and it went together nicely and looks great
10409932,"tidy and attractive. The three column Kallax was surprisingly easy to assemble. It's simple, attractive, and functional with plenty of styling options (baskets, clear shelving, drawers, cabinets, etc.). I appreciate how much more tidy my space looks."
60275812,. Fit perfect for the section we had in mind for it
20275885,Looks nice in room holds multitudes of supplies. Excellent purchase now have four of them
80275887,"so easy to assemble and looks fabulous!. It is so refreshing to put something together with clear instructions, and extra parts!"
70342199,"Great for small spaces - very sturdy, looks great!. This was perfect for placing my stereo components! Even had space for the old vinyl records!"
60275812,"Easy to assemble; Perfect functional piece. I have purchased several of these book cases. I love them. Not just for books either...crafts, display, dvds storage, food storage...etc."
20275885,Beautiful!. Looks great. Doesn't look like a piece of furniture you put together yourself!
10409932,"turned on side and it is great under the tv. Easy assembly, sturdy, and looks good"
50339292,". I'm happy with my product , I use it as shoe storage and my ironing board only problem is one side bottom magnet is not working. I think"
60275812,"Ample shelf space. I bought this several weeks ago, and had it assembled within an hour, with books already on it. I especially like the height of it, as I am using it sitting on the floor, and it makes a great end table, as well."
20278167,"Know what you're getting into!. I installed the turquoise-gray doors on a gloss-white Kallx unit. I had read the installation instructions before purchasing and thought I knew what I was getting into, so learn from my mistake! First, plan your layout. Once these inserts go in, you do not want to move them somewhere else. You have to screw these into the sides of the Kallax cubes, which means putting holes in the finish. It will help (a lot) if you have a drill and bit handy to create a pilot hole. I also use paint tape to put the spacer guides on the shelf while I did the installation so that I could make sure the insert was properly aligned throughout. As previous reviewers mentioned, make sure you check the back page of the installation guide for instructions on how to adjust the hinges up, down, forward, and backwards for aligning the doors evenly. I found using a few thicknesses of cardboard to hold the door where I wanted it helped too. Installation of four doors took about an hour. And buying four doors in high-gloss paint cost me more than the entire 4x4 Kallax itself. Not entirely happy about that, but it looks good."
40346924,"VERSATILE!!!!. I was looking for a table to put in my entryway hallway and I couldn’t find one that I TRULY loved. When I saw this shelf, I LOVED how you can have it flat or standing up!!! Glad I found this!!!!"
20305745,Great storage unit!. I bought this almost a month ago and love it! I was able to organize my materials so they are easy to access and look great!
80303437,Great piece!. I bought this last month I put it together without any help. It took a few hours. Looks great. Design of bottom shelf is not good. Had to leave screws out because it was too hard to preset holes.
59278307,"Sturdy and easy assembly. These units are sturdy and were easy to assemble. The units are extra nice because they have the option to leave the units open, fit your own containers or the drawer or door inserts which work out great. We used these under our kids bed for a nice storage, cave area to read."
80275887,. I actually bought 3 of these units and fitted one of them with the drawer and door units! It is working out great and i am thinking of buying two more for my family room!
50339292,"No problem with door alignment on my shelf unit.. Great unit that was fun to assemble, something like a giant erector set. Was surprised that the wood shelving did not have pre-drilled holes, but with a little muscle the screws went in. Now holding a stereo unit and turntable as well as a computer unit and printer in my home office."
60275812,Great features!!. I am very pleased with this furniture
70301542,"Very nice, big and good material. Exactly what we were looking for. Big enough and looks nice in my bedroom"
50305739,"Looks Like a Built-In. We bought two of the 4-cube units as a base and two 8-cube units to sit on top of those. Our builder made a wooden frame complete with pieces that covered the seams, and we painted it with glossy white to match. It now looks like a huge built-in shelving unit at a third of the price. We added drawers and doors to four of the bottom cubes, and a few of the other accessories to the top. It looks great! We painted the back wall to add a pop of color behind the shelves. Very happy with this solution. A few dings in the shelves, so not perfect, but we touched those up. Solid wood would trump this, but it’s practical for a bathroom!"
19278328,. Bought for laundry room organization
30275861,"Very nice for the price. This was a gift for a 5 yr old, yes it is attached to the wall, all the hardware came with to do this. Great storage space for books, games and we added baskets for all the small stuff, crayons , markers and coloring books. We used complimentary colored to do so and it was a breeze to assemble as always. Love it!!"
70301537,Wonderful storage. This is a wonderful piece of furniture for any sewing studio or craft room.   I use my Kallax units for storing fabrics wrapped around comic book boards. It’s deep enough for two rows of fabric in each cubby. I use the dröna fabric baskets in my Kallax to store quilting kits and fabric stabilizers.   I’d highly recommend the Kallax in any size!
00314642,"Really looks nice!. This adds a lot of beauty to the KALLAX shelf unit. Upped its appearance, making it look like a higher end purchase, other than something I put together myself. WORD OF WARNING THOUGH...you need to screw these in place, so you will be putting holes in to your KALLAX unit...HOWEVER...I did not do that, in case I want to lay my unit differently down the line. They are working just fine. They stay in place, so I won't be screwing them in."
20275885,"Super functional!. Quite functional for many uses. I needed shelving to house vinyl albums with turntable on top lining a pony wall. This was a perfect, affordable solution & holds quite a bit. Easy to assemble, solid & functional."
20275885,Love It. Looks perfect in the space
10275862,Easy to assemble and looks. Easy to assemble and looks great works for exactly what we needed it for we loved it so much we had to buy a second on for our daughter’s room
80275887,"Great for many things!. I bought 3 a month ago, two for in closets to organize and one for shelving in a bedroom. They are very well made and easy to put together."
60275812,Perfect fit. Really easy to put together. Looks great in my living room. Looks more expensive than it is!
10305741,"Functional, smart looking and versitile.. I have high gloss white cabinets in my kitchen and a high gloss white Besta unit in the dining room.....this shelf unit (also in high gloss white) blends in perfectly as a TV stand, I put it on it's side and installed 3 sets of casters on the bottom....lights along the top row and storage boxes in high gloss white along the bottom 4 cubbies. It's a great look, and very reasonable. Did the whole project for under 150.00."
70332124,Love my Eket cube. This the perfect size for underneath my bedroom windows. I can fit books or figurines and save space
20275814,"Great versatility!. This is the second time I’ve purchased multiple KALLAX items. They are versatile in my crafting workspace. Not only are they affordable but I can add doors and drawers as well! I was able to easily assemble these units and move them myself (when empty). They are sturdy, practical and have a clean look to them."
50339292,Great look and very sturdy. I bought one for my husband's home office a month ago and we are thinking about buying more to contain all the stuff.
80275887,Sturdy. Got it a month ago. Sturdy unit can work as vertical or horizontal storage. Easy assembly.
60275812,Cube. This cube is very useful. I bought 2 . It’s very stylish and low cost.
40334558,Modern look!. Love this product! Alternated with the lighter color of this product and it so changed the look of my office! It’s a cleaner look!
10305802,Amazing product. Have had for a couple of months now and it’s great and great quality
90286649,Perfect complement. Nice little handy drawers that complement the look
50339292,Love it!. It makes a great storage piece in my kitchen/dining room. I only have 3 ft of counter space and it has freed it all up. Although it was difficult to put together (my fiancé has an engineer degree and still took him 2 hours).
60221683,"Beautiful. This is my all time favorite purchase from Ikea! I bought this shelf for my home office. It holds my books, my magazine files, has great storage and looks wonderful! Literally I’m thinking of purchasing a couple more for a library wall in my family room."
10305741,Wonderful storage. I bought this about a month ago for my daughter and we LOVE it.
30275861,Love it!!. Makes organization a breeze!
20275885,. Easy to assembly and is not heavy
80275887,"Great Storage. I got this a few months ago when I moved into a new apartment. The apartment is loft-style, so I wanted a way to divide the large space into rooms. I got two of these to make my bedroom area more private and it worked out perfectly. I love that they look good from all sides. They're very versatile and I use them to hold books, clothes, etc."
19278272,Love it!. I’m using it as part of a home desk and it works wonderfully. I have the two cabinets on the lower portion and drawers on the upper! It’s so convenient!
10275862,Ikea easy!. Great shelving and easiest assembly ever!
70301537,Easy to assemble. I assembled it by myself. Directions were clear & it would have been easierveith another person.
80303437,"Was returned bought wrong color.. As there was no white shelf on display I did not notice that the location number on the tag was for a white shelf. So when I went to get it I never noticed it was white. Be careful and do not assume (you know what that means) the color is correct, double check. I did go back and get the black one I wanted and looks and does exactly what I needed."
50305739,. I bought this for more storage and it works perfectly
50339292,Gorgeous Piece. This is a gorgoeus piece that looks more expe sive than it is. I purchased it and assembled it by myself in about an hour. I rate the item itself 5 stars however I'm giving it 4 stars because the assembly instructions were not very clear & it was missing the door latches.
80275887,Perfect!. This is the fourth cube style unit in our home (1 other Kallax and 2 are Expedit and seem identical to the Kallax). These shelves fit so much and are very versatile. I love the fabric bins that fit in the cubes to hold small odds and ends. And I love that you can use the shelves vertically or horizontally.
20213312,"Love this unit! Going back for another. I bought this about a month ago, and it is great!"
10409932,Makes my craft room look awesome and organized. Bought this for my new craft room. It looks great and is sturdy and easy to put together. Tools included!

10409932,. Have it for months very good quality
20409936,Perfect for the office. This was the perfect unit to complete my home office. Just the right amount of storage and space to keep me organized.
20275885,Clean and Beautiful. Love how these bookshelves look on both sides of my Tv stand.
30275861,Kallax shelf unit. I love my new IKEA shelf. I was wanting the bigger one but cannot find one since they are sold out. I have 4 of these shelf and I love them
80275887,Nice size and sturdy. Nice size and sturdy
20275814,"Kallax Shelf Unit Is a Great Addition To Our Home!. We went to IKEA feeling confident they would have something just right for an area in our grandson's room. We found it in the KALLAX shelf unit. We purchased 2 door kits and 2 fabric bin kits and put it all together. It was a snap to put together, as are all IKEA items. I have assembled 2 complete kitchens from IKEA, and this was one of the easiest. It is substantial and is exactly what we wanted."
10275862,"Must be good, my husband keeps buying more of them. We can almost build these in our sleep now lol"
70301542,Super easy to assemble!!. We thought we were going to spend a whole day building this. Only took a couple hours. Very nice piece.
20275885,Always a winner. I bought this for my daughter and it's perfect for her needs.
80275887,Great storage. We bought 2 of these. So it gave us 16 individual shelves. Then we bought 8 of the grey cubbies. We have so much storage now!! These units are so sturdy and nice looking. Love them.
80303437,Great I have two 3 little fish thank on each level. Very happy with the purchase. It decorated the house beautifully
20275885,Organization at last!. This piece is perfect! Easy to assemble and with the drawer inserts and bins there is now a place for everything and everything is in it's place! Awesome
59278307,"Love it!. Clean lines, great configuration for my purposes"
00275848,great shelf. I got this about two months ago. great for small area.
20305745,Sturdy!. Perfect for storing fabric in my studio. I Love it! Have since bought two more for my living room!
60275812,"Looks great!. This unit is very well made and was not hard to put together. It looks way more expensive than it is, especially with the Drone boxes."
50339292,"We love it. Take your time putting it together, make sure every every screw hole and tab match up to the diagram and it will be easy. Once it's together you'll love it, would not hesitate to buy another."
70301537,Love my Kallax. Love my Kallax
40415601,Great storage unit. This is the 3rd shelf we bought. It looks great and the price cannot be beat.
70342199,. Bought 2 of these with TV stand looks great love the look
09017483,"Perfect, and well built !. Put 6 units together for the perfect, built in look on my 13' wide, 10' high Great Room Wall. Solid with a classic design it's exactly what I was picturing. I get compliments about the wall from everyone! I designed and bought this for it's functionality, but it became a focal point!"
00275848,Love it. I bought this month and I love where a put it.
89307643,Looks great!! Adds lots of. Looks great!! Adds lots of character to the room.
50339292,IKEA Imperfections guaranteed. As another review stated - if you're seeking perfection leave this item behind. The doors do not go on evenly no matter how much you fidget due to defects. Either learn to live with it or return it. If I had the receipt I'd be returning it.
80275887,Great shelf. Pretty sturdy. Easy to put together. Looks great with mix of books and baskets.
20278167,Great. They look so pretty!
99017186,I love my Kallax. I have about 6 through out my home I love it love it love it
80275887,5th buying and would buy again. I love this shelf. I purchased this one to organize my diy supplies.
60278170,"Incredible Inserts. Love this product and it looks perfect in the Kallax module. It's easy to assemble, and it makes a perfect insert. Elegant and practical."
80428852,"Easy assembly. Got this to be attached to the EKET Cabinet with door and shelf unit as a set, all very easy and instructions were clear with all parts marked to join together."
20275885,Good for the price but not very applicable. This bookcase was a good deal for its price but the width of the panels is kind of too wide making the things inside it to stay in dark.
20275814,"Super sturdy. Love these, I put my workout equipment in them (heavy stuff on the bottom) but they looks great. Only minor detail would be the ugly metal screws that show on top, but it’s minor."
80275887,"Excellent for nursery. Is a great purchase for to equip the baby room, it has the perfect size."
10305741,. Love it. Very good quality and easy to assemble
60221683,Great shelving units for closet. Bought these to use as shelves for closet and it was easy to put together and fits nicely in spaces. It provides the right amount of shelving for our needs.
60275812,Perfect!. We love this. It is well made and easy to put together. We added the cat house with pads and the kitties love their new spot!
20275885,"Perfect for my needs!. I wanted something for a tv stand in my living room other than the usual stands available. This item was perfect. I live in a upper flat and wanted a product that I could use for storage and displaying my pictures and other items. While also being functional as a tv stand.  Assembly was simple, it is easy to move, and looks great in my small space."
20275885,Very Versatile and Affordable. Really enjoy my Kallax Shelf unit. Super easy to build. I have a small apartment and storage is always lacking. This helps clean up my living room by keeping things tucked away. It also makes a few decorations really stand out by putting them visibly on display.
20275814,. Easy to assemble. Perfect for my small space.
20275885,Just what we needed.. We purchased this piece to use horizontally. We added doors on each end with drawers in the middle along the top and baskets along the bottom. It's a beautiful piece that works for what we intended.
20275885,Holds a lot of scrapbook papers. I love the shelving units
20275885,Practical use as shelf or TV stand. We bought for shelving and decided to lay it flat for a TV stand. We put books and bought baskets to store things. It's a clean look!
70339291,Great look and very sturdy. I have now bought two of these and may buy more in the near future. Work equally well for books and my husband's 3d printing materials.
20275885,"Great for my record player and vinyls. I have searched everywhere for something big enough to put my turntable on, along with space to hold my vinyls. I came across this in the store and everything fits perfectly. It’s the perfect size and it was easy to put together. The price wasn’t bad either. I want to get another one when I move into a bigger house."
00415599,Sturdy shelving. I bought this to have shelving in my bedroom closet. Really love how easy it was to put together and looks and functions great. Will definitely be back for more furniture.
30275861,Wonderful storage. I live being able to organize all my fabrics and trims with this unit. Now I can see all my colorful fabrics!!
30275861,"Meet My Expectations. Love the size for my wall space. Does not overwhelm the room, but has lots of storage versatility and design."
20275885,Sturdy piece. This was perfect for toy storage. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.
10409932,Good shelf. Much easier to put together than previous Ikea products.
19278328,"EASY AND LOOKS AWESOME!. I was looking for this type of unit for my unused computer nook. The dimensions were perfect and was easy to assemble. It is pretty heavy to lift if needed, and having 2 adults working together makes the entire project much easier!"
80275887,"Buy it. Really.. Yes, I'm an idiot. I bought one of these and a tall Billy bookcase because I couldn't decide which was the better one to have. I'm really stupid. I should have bought 4 of these! They're easy to assemble & are so much more stable! Pair with the Drona boxes & you have a gorgeous bookcase. I'm buying more. Now."
70342199,Great space. I purchased to put on my daughters patio to place her herbs and plants
00275848,. Perfect for our needs. Easy to put together.
50334591,EKET Cabinet. I obtained the help of an IKEA rep on the showroom floor for assistance. He reviewed this item and guaranteed that the KNIPSA Basket would fit in this cabinet . Unfortunately it did not. Returned item and went elsewhere to look for a cabinet and basket that would fit.
89435221,Hinges problem. One of the open/close hinges does not work.
79278293,Love it 😍. Love it 😍
80275887,Love the shelf unit. I bought this unit a month or so ago and really am glad to have it. I use it lying on its side and as a bottom piece for a smaller unit I have in my sewing room. I wish I had gotten the wheels for it and will once I get a chance to go pick it up.
99017445,I love it!. It’s strange to say but this shelf added life to my living room! And building it was cake!
20278167,"Disappointing. They took me three times as long to finish than the unit itself! There's no written directions; just pictures. They expect you to screw through two layers of board and into the unit to set the doors.. With a screwdriver and an incredibly short screw. These will absolutely test your upper body force and strength. The knobs are a joke. They're tiny and have no grip to open with ease. I purchased them for functionality but, in my opinion, they play more of an aesthetic role. I ended up finishing but realized I had screwed in one for backwards. (it could have been fine but I wanted the knobs together). I made the decision to take the one side out and screw it back in on the other side. I physically couldn't do it. Trying to screw those little screws in through such thick layers took every ounce of energy out of me. My boyfriend tried finishing it for me and even he couldn't. We ended up having to glue it in.  Lastly, for a piece of wood, you're paying (assuming you bought two like the picture shows) almost as much for the unit itself. Crazy.  I don't recommend."
40334558,Great looking and functional!. I love these wall mounted cabinets. I have three in my bathroom for towel storage. Super easy to assemble and mount. Highly recommend!
80275887,"It's a bookcase !. Typical IKEA product, built to typical IKEA standards. I so wish that I could build my own units or could afford something better. For flat pack furniture, this is OK - not great (like most IKEA low- to mid-range products), but no worse than everyone else's more expensive alternatives."
50334591,"perfect fit for my needs. These guys fit my organizational needs perfectly, I do with they came in black to match my other Ikea furniture thought. Nothing a bit of spray paint won't fix, but minus one star for not coming in a very common Ikea color."
10409932,"Cube storage. Very easy to put together, and nice strong cabinet."
70301542,"I got burned buying these.... These are a really great product line. I plunged in head first and built my home office with a full set of these. (2) 5x5 units on the walls, 1 4x4 unit in the middle and another 4x2 unit against my near wall. But alas, I went with Birch and now it appears that Birch is discontinued so I'm left without any ability to get drawers, doors or accessories that match. What am I supposed to do? rip it all out and convert to white? black will make the whole office a black tomb. I'm really bummed. I like the design, and the accessories work really well, but if I can't buy more what the heck am I supposed to do?"
00275848,. great product for the price. easy to put together and easy to move around.
70301537,KALLAX for Fabric Storage. The KALLAX 5x5 is perfect for the storage of my fabric in my art studio. It is sturdy and the cubes are the perfect size. Everyone at the store was very helpful in putting the unit on my cart and loading it into my car. I am happy with my purchase.
70339291,"Can't get enough of 'em.. We loved the industrial look of the Fjallbo, especially the fact that it uses real, solid wood. Very sturdy, but easy to build and light enough to move alone (when empty). We've had some for a few years, and they're still going strong, so we bought more. Absolutely love them!"
20275814,Nice storage. Put it on wheels and slide 3 under a table for convenient storage. Sturdy enough to move around yet still light enough to easily move. Had to be careful installing wheels since not solid construction
50214678,"Looks good and is sturdy.. This took about 30 minutes to put together, make sure you follow the instructions and make sure on the pieces you are putting together. Once together it looks good, I use it for framed pictures so I did not attach it to the wall, if you are putting heavier items on it I would suggest mounting it with screws for safety."
80275887,"Sturdy addition to child’s room. Love how many picture books this holds! Books on top, toy bins below. Helped contain some piles and add structure in my toddler’s room."
20409936,"Works great. I bought this for my sons room to help organize his toys and books. The shelves are the perfect size and after adding a few of the IKEA cloth bins, I was able to organize everything just the way I wanted to!! Assembly could've been a little smoother, but overall wasn't too terrible..."
40275846,I like it. Easy to assemble. Nice size. Lots of options to use it
59278307,This unit is great and. This unit is great and versatile.
20275885,Just what we need. Perfect for the purpose needed
90286649,. I bought this last month Im so happy that I will get more next time I go to Ikea
20213312,VITTSJO SHELF UNIT. EXCELLENT ATTRACTIVE STRONG SHELF UNIT WITH GLASS SHELVES ALLOWING MORE LIGHT THROUGH.
20275814,"Great Chubby. This is a great piece of furniture, sturdy, looks great and is easy to put together. IKEA also has many different baskets that can be used in the shelf unit."
70342199,"Versatile. Bought 1 month ago, love it Looka great next to another Fjallbo unit we bought 5 months ago."
00314642,Gray Addition. I bought this to use for storage of electronic components and other supplies to keep close but hidden.  The bookcase is used as my end table in the living room.
10409932,Love it. I am So pleased with purchase. I love it
00415599,"Very sturdy unit. I bought 2 of these for my extensive collection of LP's and 78's. The size is perfect for albums and I needed something that could hold the weight. This thing is very well constructed (although you have to assemble it). It went together like a champ, taking me about 20 minutes each. However there are 2 weights of these units when I bought mine and opted for the heavier one. If I remember correctly the price was the same for either weight. I am careful not to overload the shelves since vinyl records tend to be very heavy, but haven't had any problem whatsoever yet. It also looks great in the living room."
80275887,Very good. We purchased this shelf unit and 30” wide table top as a work station for my son’s room. They look very high quality and nice!
00275848,Easy Assembly. As a crafter I need A LOT of storage space. KALLAX units work well together in my space. They were easy to assemble and I can use them in many configurations in my area. This is my second purchase of multiple units.
00275848,Glad I made that purchase. The shelf is very sturdy and not difficult to assemble. We also purchased the Lekman Boxes for my granddaughter's toys so cleaning up is a breeze.
70342199,"Smart looking shelf. I love the look and quality of this shelf. My only downfall was putting it together and not being able to screw all the screws without forcing it in. A bit on the expensive side for what you receive. Otherwise, I love it!"
20275885,"Love this unit, would love a decorative glass door. This is the most utilitarian and versatile shelving unit. But with my dust allergies, I have a hard time cleaning it. I had seen one of my European friend have the same unit with a floral printed glass door. Would love that version if it became available in the US."
40415601,Everything in it's place. This was exactly what we need to replace a small desk in the corner of our living room dining room area. All we ever did was put stuff on top of it and into it's single draw. Now we have a place for more things and more things have a place ... now to figure out the dog hair situation.
70301542,. This was perfect for my wall on the second floor I decorated this shelf with all crystal and tea lights it’s beautiful.
80275887,"Sturdy Shelves!. I bought 3 of these for my basement to attempt to organize the playroom and I am so happy with them. They are very sturdy, solid and heavy. You can't beat the price. They are great for stacking or side by side. You can't go wrong. Highly recommend."
80275887,"Great for the family room and clearing clutter!. I bought this for our office, movie room. It keeps magazines, newspapers, office files and books organized, accessible but cleared away!"
90286649,"Finally!!!. Thank you Ikea for finally giving me options to actually house the mess in the Kallax piece, adding storage, and helping me keep my house neat and clean as it's also classy looking!"
90495695,Perfect !. Im using this to organize my HTV and vinyl rolls.
20213312,Good display shelf. Very good display shelf for pictures and family items.
40275846,Fabolous Shelf Unit. Love this unit.... Easy to assemble and sturdy. It looks stylish and elegant in any room. Plenty of room for anything.
30275861,Great piece. This wasn't difficult to assemble and looks great in my office! Especially like that I could put the cabinet inserts wherever I preferred.
80275887,"Super easy to build and looks amazing.. Super easy to build and looks amazing. I built this by myself, it took me about 1 1/2 hours to complete."
40423719,Love!. Perfect for organizing my 12x12 paper
89294532,"Great shelves. This shelving system added just the look I was going for in my office without breaking the bank. Other systems were over $1,000. It took a while to assemble, but well worth it."
80275887,"Best Quality Cube Organized. Better quality than Target or Walmart brands, same price."
80275887,Exactly what I needed. I put this together a few weeks ago & it is just what a needed. I will be getting another to finish a reorganization project. It was easier to put together by myself than I anticipated. Excellent value.
20275814,Dorm room storage solution. Bought this for under the bed in a dorm room. Cute and functional.
20409936,Kallax Bookshelf. Great value for the money!
70342199,"Handsome Industrial Style. Bought this about a month ago--so I can't yet speak to it's durability--but it is a very attractive addition to our home. It was pretty easy to put together, even for me (with chronic pain), but watch out for those little holes where the webbing adds a decorative touch. It is easy to put together backwards and have to start again. (I know from experience.) The shelves are quite spacious, and there's not a lot of structure to hold books or such on the shelf without assistance. I am currently using mine combined with dark stained wooden crates. The crates hold notebooks: the wood slats coordinate with the wood look on the top and disguise the not-so-pretty notebooks for a cohesive look."
20275885,Nice unit for vinyl. Good together easily. It fits vinyl albums perfectly.
70301537,"Perfect for board games. If you collect board games this is a great shelf. For us it's about the right size to limit ourselves with (i.e. don't own more board games that can fit in the shelves). But also it just fits them so well. It was pretty quick to build, and feels very sturdy too. Pretty competitive price too."
20278167,"Bad design compared to older version. (note: this is a similar review I left on the drawers) If you ever purchased an older version of this you will hate this new version. You have to screw these into the shelving structure, so once they are there, they aren't moving unless you want to see all of the holes left behind. Being able to change how you used these in the old version was a great feature (especially if you move a lot). I am very disappointing in this new version. Quality is very low and it is not easy to install especially if you want the doors to be straight."
80275887,Shelf. Great addition to my craft room
79442694,Underframe lifts Kallax to a higher design. We love the way our new KALLAX looks and the storage it provides. We added two sets of drawer inserts and it dressed the piece up even more.
30275861,"AWESOME!. I have one of these in my office, as well as my daughter's room. This is the best unit out there! I love, love, love it! So versatile and perfect for so many needs! Amazing quality and a great value! I highly recommend!"
50339292,Exactly what I wanted. It holds shoes and fits perfectly
70301537,Art storage. Perfect for my new art studio
20275885,"Great Quality!. I have a few of these and they are the best buy for the price and quality that I have found so far. They work great for so many different things, from storing toys to clothes to office supplies!"
00275848,Kallax. Very easy to put together.
70301542,"Perfect for my space. I bought this about a month ago in black and it overpowered the room! So I utilized ikeas great return policy and got the walnut look alike instead. It fits all my art supplies. Fiber arts, metals, ceramics, painting, and print making materials."
20275885,. I'm using as tv stand. Laying it sideways
50339292,"Useful. I just bought this and assembled it. Like other reviewers noted the doors don't line up, and it appears to be because of where the holes to attach them were put -- as in manufacturing error. Other than this flaw, the unit is very sturdy and attractive"
79278250,"Great product!. I boughtt this product months ago,very space saving and funtional."
20275885,Good fit for smaller spaces. Bought this almost a month ago. First one had two boards that split while putting it together. IKEA has a very easy return process. They exchanged with no questions asked. Second one went together with no issues and is quite sturdy. Looks great and is very functional.
20278167,Great look with the Kallax units. Bought these for my hubby’s Kallax unit. They look great but the only downside was they can’t be used with the full size cube inserts.
60275812,Album storage. Great piece to store vinyl!
00314642,"looks great. The drawers look great and are easy to assemble. However, if you want to install two sets side by side you will need to off set the screws on one set."
30275861,. I liked everything of your store
70339291,"Love the style. This shelf fit in perfect with my decor. I assembled it myself and other than putting a couple pieces on backwards and having to redo it, it didn't take me more than an hour and a half. Very sturdy and well worth the money."
20275814,"Perfect Storage size. Big enough to hold lots of small items (I use it for Vinyl records), and small enough for a corner space. I love it!"
70301537,great storage and room divider. I bought this when it was on sale and so happy I did ; I was looking for a functional room divider that did not block out any light or view into the other room because of the small space intended for.
60275812,Great and simple. We bought this because is so easy to assemble and is so practical. We use it for our fish tank. But we have another one for the kid's shoes.
20275885,". I bought this for my living room, so happy with my purchase. Very easy to assemble, clear instructions! I like the fact you can use it vertically and horizontally and you and you can add shelves or drawers!"
20275814,"We have a house full!!!. We have purchased numerous kallax cubbies as we call them....we built a wall of kallax cubbies to use as storage for our clothes in the bedroom. Of course we used all the different inserts...the doors, the double drawers, and the various cloth and plastic baskets. We had to configure the units around something that was already mounted so we use all the different units altogether to make it fit....we routinely put legs on the bottom units that sit on the floor and it seems to enhance the look to make it look more like furniture in a home and not just a college set up."
70391038,. back to buy another one!!
60275812,". We bought two of these, one is great, the other is listing already. There's a LOT of steps to setting it up and it's best done with a partner unless you have 4 hands"
40415192,"Nice!. My daughter loves this bookcase. It is the perfect color and looks very nice. The only issue that we had was when we were connecting the back piece to one shelf. As we tried to tighten the second screw, the wood started to crack. No matter what we tried, this kept happening. We finally just used one screw since the shelf seemed solid."
50339292,Just what she wanted!. This was purchased for our granddaughter who has a loft type apt.. She loves it. In my opinion it should have a back and not be open.
20275885,. We bought 3 and created a tv/gaming shelving unit out of it. Looks great and works great for our needs.
10345073,"Great look. I bought these hoping they would fit a bookshelf that is not IKEA. They did not fit and they were very long, back to front, so they just didn't work for me but I think it's a good looking item."
20275885,Cool Storage Space Replacement Ever. I’m totally happy with this piece. I placed it behind my cushy sofa where I was able to store all my small decorative items I use throughout the living room.
00275848,"Versatile. I have a number of these units and have used them free standing on end, side, and mounted on the wall."
20275885,Knew it would be at IKEA. Finding it at As Is for reduced price in acceptable condition was a plus!
80275887,"really sturdy,heavy great buy for price. I had a male neighbor put these together for me. He was impressed at good wt, how sturdy they are & all tools included in box. I laid them down on either side of fire place & I am truly happy with them."
80275887,Great adaptability. I bought this to give myself extra storage room in my bedroom. Love finding drawers and doors for it so much and how it looked that I bought a smaller one to mount on top of it.
00314642,Perfect accessory to the Kallax. I was repurposing one of my Kallax shelves for a bedroom dresser and needed something besides a basket for smaller items. The drawer unit is the perfect solution. Easy to install (with a drill). Drawers are perfect size and glide nicely. I will probably purchase additional units for other shelves I own.
20275885,Awesome deal. Bought this as an entertainment center and it is perfect!
90286649,". I really like bing able to use the full height of my Kallax. The handles are a little difficult to grasp because they are so small, but otherwise, this completely fits my needs."
80275887,"Great product. My husband and I just purchased this product and put it up in our bedroom and we love it! It creates a cozy feeling and it looks great. The box is a bit heavy to carry up 2 flights of stairs, but it's worth it. It took us about an hour to put it together along with some of the drawer inserts. We definitely recommend it!"
20275814,Great for toys. This is the 3rd self unit like this I have bought.
80275887,The Kallax unit was exactly. The Kallax unit was exactly what I needed to manage my fabric stash. It was easy to assemble & looks good in my craft room.
80275887,Love the cubes holding different school items.. This unit was purchased for my preschool/pre-k classroom. Love how the cubes hold just the proper amount for my littles to work with during our unit studies.
40415601,Multiple use. I bought for my home office. Woeks well and blended wirh existing furniture.
40275846,"Wonderful item!. I bought this last month to organize my home office. It was easy to assemble, looks good and serve the purpose it want it for."
70301542,"LAST A LIFETIME!. We have had ours for over a decade, and it's still in great shape! We've used it for a number of things, moved it allover the house, and it is just as sturdy as when we first bought it. There are many more color/finish options than when we bought ours. If it didn't last so long, I'd get a new one!"
60275812,Versatile. Perfect for holding records!
59278307,Created a great TV Stand. Has draws and doors to hold media. Was easy to cut down to 3 x 2 instead of 4 x 2. I added feet from other IKEA brand group. Draws and doors operate smooth. I like the finish and it matches my other white IKEA furniture.
20275885,just what we needed. The shelves are easy to assemble and exactly as described. Very pleased.
20275885,good looking bookcase. it is sturdy and you can position it vertically or horizontally depending on your space or needs. great buy.
10305802,"Great shelf....for something other than books.. I bought this shelf a bout a month ago. It was fairly easy to put together and seemed packaged REALLY well to avoid dings and breakage. Had it assembled in less than 30 minutes and it’s as sturdy as can be. The levels on the legs were a nice touch since it’s on carpet and things seem to tip if they aren’t set down just right. The only downside is that it’s too tall to sub as an entry console and since the shelves aren’t adjustable....won’t hold average sized books upright without heavy bookends. since the middle shelf is glass, that doesn’t seem like the best idea for us. Would probably make a great bar cart/shelf or storage for extra pillows/throws....even in a DIY closet revamp as part of a “system”. Just wasn’t the right piece for us, so we are going to return it."
80275887,Easy assembly. Works great for storage in my sewing room.
90286649,"Useful but could be better. Pretty decent, but left a little to be desired. The main box and the drawer bottoms are flimsy cardboard, which doesn't matter as much since it's going in your shelves but is still a little disappointing. And the drawers are way shallower than I expected, about half the height of the front of the drawer you see when it's closed. And finally, when you're installing them, you have to screw them into your shelves, so it turns what I thought would be a modular design, one that I could move around or remove as I liked, into a semi-permanent addition, because if you take the drawers out, you're left with 4 big holes in the sides of the shelf where you installed it. So make sure you're happy with the slot you decide to put this in before you finish installing it."
60275812,. Pretty simple to put together. Sturdy and lots of area to put your stuff.
20213312,"I use it for my. I use it for my plants! It looks great from both sides , as it is in front of the window!"
20278167,"Good product for some, not for all.. We have been using the kallax system since it was known as the (superior) expedit system. We needed a few new inserts. We saw the design change and opted to try them out. After reviewing the instructions before actually installing and then seeing the other reviews, I'm going to return this. The beauty of the original models was the ability to change the drawers with your needs. This new model requires for it to be permanently installed (or leave holes when you move the drawer). If you like versatility, pass on this. If you are ok with a permanent install, this should work for you but review other reviews around the challenges. I imagine Ikea is adapting design to reduce wood consumption,which should be applauded but something has been lost here."
50339292,"Nice solid piece, multiple uses. I am currently working to convert a spare bedroom in my house into an office/craft/music room and I needed low profile storage for funky musical instruments. Once assembled, this product is solid. It is also light and easy to move around.  I feel as if I changed my mind about using the the shelf unit for storage, I could readily use it any place else for storage and it would not be out of place. The top is a nice high to stand and do a task on it and my only complaint is one of the doors is not fully aligned straight, but it is not so noticeable. (I think I notice it because I assembled it and tried switching the doors and parts to make it straighter.)   Depending on needs, I would recommend this for video games with additional shelving. It's a great height to sit or stand and play and the back of the cabinet is open for wires and what-not. It would also make a great sideboard for dishes or an aquarium, too."
50214678,Vhittsjo shelf. I love this shelf it fits great in my small apartment
40346924,love this shelf. I purchased two of the birch color. One as a tv unit and another as a dresser for my bedroom. Its super functional and sturdy. Eventually it will become a bookcase when I move but for now I love it.
60333954,"If taking more than 10 min, you're doing it wrong. And, I say that out of experience. By the last one, I was able to get the frame put together in under 5 minutes. Like others have noted, the directions have to be followed exactly. 1) Connect the top (#1) with one of the sides, 2) construct the T and snap it in place, 3) add the other side, 4) slide in the backing, and 5) insert the bottom (which has connectors like #1). After it's put together, secure everything in place with fasteners. No chips, broken pieces, or agony. I, too, was guilty of user error. The first one took way too long and with too much effort. I felt pretty silly when I was able to put together the last one so quickly. It really is all outlined in the pictures."
70301537,Perfect for my grandkids playroom!. I’m very happy with the quality.
10305741,"the cabinet is really good. I'm so happy with it !. excellent cabinet, fits right in with my other furniture. Really very nice!"
70286645,Easy install. What's not to love. Easy to follow directions. Easy install. Clean.
80275887,Solid shelf!. Bought this a few weeks ago to hold my linens inside a closet. Fit perfectly and with a little gorilla glue (which I always use) this thing is solid as a rock. Great purchase!
40346924,"love this shelf!!. This shelf is the perfect size, yet not heavy!! My disappointments: I wanted the walnut finish that evidently is a test color and there isn't a date to manufacture more. So I bought the light grey....but that color doesn't come in the half size of the shelf........So I can't have a tall shelf and a half size shelf that matches. The Ekert shelf light grey is a different color than the Kallax light grey......but all the whites match that IKEA makes. So I'm not pleased with IKEA product development team AT ALL, but the shelf is great"
20275814,"Great quality, Great price!. I am so happy with this product. It's the perfect amount of storage. It has a very clean look. I'm going back to buy more."
80275887,"Simple, great look!!. I love this storage unit. Simple, yet elegant!"
10275862,"Love, love, love!. I have numerous units like this in my sewing room. Organizing fabric and kits. Also have cupboards for threads and supplies! Great product and good quality!!!"
10275862,. They look great in my kitchen
20275885,Beautiful. I love this shelf. We lay ours horizontally and use as a TV stand. I love how it looks and the use of the baskets to hide things we don't want visible. Easy assembly.
40275846,. I put it on its side to double as a bench and I've been really happy with how organized my room feels and having the extra seating space!
50214678,"Nice. Useful, practical, affordable, aesthetic, just right, lovely..."
60275812,Great product. This is an awesome product for the price% Great for my needs.
70301537,"Solid cabinet.. This cabinet is real Solid! The instructions recommended not to put the cabinet together with 1 person only, but I figure I try, and if it does not work, get help. I was able to get the whole deal together by myself, but getting it back upright after puttibg the corner felts on, was a real challenge and took all the strength I had , because the cabinet ends up to be real solid and heavy. Great buy though, and exactly what was discribed and what I needed."
00275848,Love it!. Using as an under window shelving/storage area for my daughters new “big girl room”. It went together easy and fits PERFECTLY under the window! Very happy with purchase!
60278170,"Quality has declined sharply. I bought the Kallax storage unit probably 6-8 years ago and bought a few inserts for it. Back then, while they were still the particleboard that's been laminated (and I bought it knowing that an not expecting high end furniture) it was at least sturdy and you could move it around from one hole in the frame to another, or you could flip it around so that it was a left opening door instead of a right opening one, for instance. It made it really convenient to change the purpose of the unit. I decided to put the unit in another room and change around the inserts, get a couple of more inserts with doors and one with a drawer. Now the inserts are super cheaply made out of something just north of cardboard that's been laminated and now you have to screw it into the base unit, which means you're putting holes in that and now you have lost the flexibility of changing how you're using the base unit. The only part if the same material as before is the door. Very disappointed, and will be returning it for a refund. IKEA has gone too far in cheapening their product."
20409936,Awesome space saver!. This has saved me headaches with kids toys. I bought bins to go in the cubbies and now have a place for all of my son’s toys.
30275861,"Solid shelf unit. Bought for husband's home office. Solid, sturdy piece of furniture. Very easy to put together, but make sure you put something over pieces before nailing!"
00415599,"great opction. I bought it a few days ago and it was so easy to set it, it looks great in my kids room !!,"
80303437,Perfect fit for the space I have. We bought this for our bathroom and it fit perfectly for what we needed.
10275862,"Sturdy and long lasting. I have several of these, plus I recommend them to friends. It takes about 25-30 minutes to put together, but it last years! I use it as a book case, clothes/shoe storage in walk in closets, free standing pantry. So many uses."
40275846,"Easy assembly!. I purchased two Kallax shelf units to complete my new entertainment center. Assembly was easy and accomplished quickly. From home to store, back home and assembly took just 2.5 hours! The most difficult part was a mismarked bin number that created confusion at the end of the shopping trip."
30275861,Love this Storage Concept!. I LOVE this storage idea so much! It’s changed the whole look of a room I needed to share the space as my home office! So modern and clean and functional with the DRONA cubes! I have pjs and t shirts etc stored. Looks so neat and sophisticated you would never know it was all my junk! Great piece and easy to put together with 2 people definitely!
20275885,Sturdy and well designed. I bought this product because I really liked its simple and confident design. I was so please that two of us could put it together while we cheered each other on and had fun!
70342199,"Fairly easy to assemble. This shelf unit is very sturdy compared to a ladder type on returned to bed bath and beyond. That was impossible to assemble and the wood holes did not accept screws easily. It was fairy easy for my husband to put together because it was metal. It fits well in my daughter little studio. Her kitty was the first thing on it, and that went without incident. It matches well with her other Ikea Furniture"
20275885,Perfect for MANY applications. I bought 2 of these on separate occasions. One for my office which was purely utilitarian. It was so nice looking and sturdy we bought one for our living room in the darker color. With a few baskets & décor it really looks high end!
00314642,Fabulous. I have bought several of these for my home office kallax. They are easy to assemble and give a neat appearance. I recommend that you drill 1/8” pilot holes for screws that hold it into the Kallax for faster easier assembly.
60275812,Love it!. I love this shelf in addition to the taller kallax shelf. We use them as night stands and they look great!
90286649,Great Add-On. We bought these for office supplies to put in our Ikea cubes. They work really well and are a nice add when the storage cube boxes are just too big. Glad we got them and they look nice too.
10275862,GREAT FOR DIFFERENT NEEDS. I had a hutch on my desk that I wanted put somewhere else. I purchased one of these and laid it down on the side. It was perfect place for the hutch. This one I purchased for my dressing room to store shoes in. I keep my boots/shoes in containers. This shelving unit was perfect. It held multiple containers in each bin. I was also able to store sandals with no bins in one of the Drona boxes without it looking cluttered. This is a wonderful storage system with a million possibilities.
70342199,Awesome for a Studio. My boyfriend and I got this. He finally set it up and it is just PERFECT for a studio size. Thank yo u
69278335,"Great look, great features, definitely what my wif. Terrific piece. Just what my wife wanted. Easy to assemble."
10275862,My Favorite Shelf in my house!. I waited for 3 months to buy this shelf and then i bought 2 of them! They are extremely easy to put together and we did it in about a half hour. They are very sturdy and come with 2 different brackets to secure it to the wall. I have alot of scrapbooks on it and they fit perfectly!
70342199,Great function. We purchased this piece and it fits perfectly. Have plans to purchase additional pieces.
10275862,Wonderful!. I love how easy these shelves are to put together and how sturdy they are!
60275812,Great product. I purchased two of these and are currently using them as bedside tables love them they are super easy to build and hold a lot of stuff
70342199,Good looking and sturdy. I am very happy with the shelves. They are much sturdier than I thought they would be. I like the wood on top. It adds a nice look. You need to pay attention to the drawings in the assembly instructions when you put the corner brackets on. Not a big deal to redo once I saw it.
10409932,"Love it, very sturdy!. Bought this to eliminate some bigger furniture in my bedroom, was such a great choice! It holds a lot & the drawer Insert is amazing! Definitely a 2 person job for putting it together."
60275812,"I purchased this shelf and. I purchased this shelf and the inserts to use as a wine rack. It is great! It’s the perfect size and holds so many bottles (32). It even fits under my counter height dining room table. I have two other units in my den that I use as a TV stand and book shelf. They are very useful, sturdy, and well made. Assembly is easy. I highly recommend Kalyan."
79285830,Easy!. Really easy o build and hang on wall. Nice quality doesn’t look cheap despite being inexpensive
20275814,"Thick!. Didn’t realize how thick these would be. They are definitely not going anywhere. Nice and solid! We used them as part of my teen’s ikea hack bed. I was unsure of the plan, till I saw them. They are real furniture."
50339292,Wonderful office storage. I bought the shelf unit to hold my printer and for extra storage. Works great! Easy to assemble.
40346924,SO EASY TO PUT TOGETHER!. I am so happy I bought this shelving unit! I am using it for horizontal shelving to store kids toys in. Easy to follow directions with all the needed tools included.
70301537,Optional back. I like it a lot but having the option to purchase a back would be great.
60275812,. So useful! Easy to move around and has a look that won't go out of style.
20275814,Happy. I love my new she shelf.i can keep many things
10409932,Very functional. I bought 2 of these for my office/craft room. I love the new 3 x 4 unit! It's the perfect size. Assembly was easy. The first one my daughter and I assembled together in about an hour. The second one I built by myself in 45 - 50 minutes. Tip: it helps to use a rubber mallet to gently tap stubborn pegs into place.
20275885,"New shelves are awful. We bought some for the office a couple of years ago and they were very good; sturdy and lovely finish for the price. We went to match it and the new shelves are poor quality and do not match (Why would Ikea do that?) We had to go with the very awful shiny white, but more than that, the dimensions are not the same. These are not as sturdy. Plus the delivery was a nightmare, and this will be our last order ever for anything from Ikea."
40346924,Just what I needed. I just wanted something to go under the TV and a little storage; this fit the bill. Easy to assemble and just very cute.
00275848,"Easy, beautiful and functional. I bought 3 and absolutely love them! 2 were to organize my closet and 1 to organize my son's homeschool stuff. They're simple, sturdy and fit exactly as I had planned per the website's measurements. The directions were easy to follow and It took less than 30 minutes to put each shelf together. Also, the cheapest option avaliable for similar shelving over several other retailers. Definitely a great buy!"
70301542,. I bought this unit a month ago and overall happy with the product.
80275887,"Perfect for kid’s rooms!. We have several of these units in our home for our kids. They are sturdy and a great organization solution for toys, clothes, etc."
80275887,Extremely sturdy!. I love these shelves! I will buy more. They are very versatile and extremely easy to assemble. Great product for the $.
00415599,Great size!. I bought this about a month ago and am so glad that I did!
20275814,Love these. I did a bunch of the Kallax units for books and records. They look great and there are enough sizes that I've been able to almost create the illusion of built in book cases. Affordable yet durable which is a huge priority for our household.
50339292,Looks sharp. Its very functional and looks great. Extremely good price for the quality. The doors don't line up perfectly even though the other elements are apparently level (used a level to check)
10345073,"Looks great, Dimensions are hard to work with. Bought this in hopes of sliding it under a cube organizer and putting an xbox in it so we could store the controllers and such under it. The dimensions listed for the item are the dimensions at the widest parts of the length and width, so while the xbox did fit in the front of the tray, it only went about two inches before getting stuck since it tapers. So now I have a tray that I'm not really using for anything currently. For paper or other smaller things, this could be awesome though."
40275846,Love it. Great storage solution. Is just what I needed
60275812,"Nice Unit - VERY Poorly Packaged. I am pleased with the unit overall. It was quite easy to assemble by myself. I like the look of the unit; however, there are dings, nicks, and scratches on almost every piece of shelving. I had it shipped since I live a distance away. I was shocked at the literal holes in 3 sides of the box it was shipped in, with absolutely NOTHING between the shelves and the box. Seriously?? No packaging whatsoever? It would have come in better condition with packaging around it. VERY DISAPPOINTED! I would return it for another one but I need it at work now and don't have time nor want the hassle of returning it. If this is how items are shipped, I sadly won't be a repeat customer."
20275814,"Good bones. I had been looking at very similar style units at other stores, but did not see the value. Just because something is inexpensive, you still want good quality. Ikea was my last stop and when I saw how much thicker the shelves were, I knew it was going home with me."
40275846,Useful storage.. Use for lunch bags and backpacks.
80275887,Perfect Furniture. Great Furniture good quality!
20275814,"Great storage. Very easy to put together, looks great and modern."
79278250,Perfecto. Perfecto
80334603,. Ability to hang and connect in irregular patter allows for a very interesting shelf system
60275812,"Perfect unit for vinyl record storage. Assembles easily, holds approximately 40 LPs per cube."
10409932,"Finally, a three column version of the Kallax!. We have used the two columns by four row Kallax shelf units for years and were excited when a three column by four row version became available. We added a few Kallax doors/drawer to the bottom row and a few baskets to the open cubbies. We like how the white shelves blend in with our white walls and are not a focal point to the space."
50339292,"Loved it!. I bought this table to setve as a hall table in my foyer. I love the mix of metal with wood! Its industrial yet a little rustic looking which totally fits my style. My only qualm is that one of the cabinet drawers doesn't line up just right, and it seems to be a manufacturing issue. That issue is not a big deal, though because the door still seems to latch on to the magnet and close. I'm super happy with my purchase, and as usual can't wait for my next trip put to IKEA."
30275861,"Kallax rocks!. I had two of the old Expedit shelves and have regretted leaving them behind when we moved 6 years ago. I just replaced my old loves with two Kallax units and I couldn’t be happier! I created a quasi-built-in look in our bonus room (with a 2X4 Kallax unit under the TV) and it looks so much neater, took care of my kids’ clutter. These are my absolute favorite IKEA pieces. Great quality at a very fair price."
00314642,"good idea. Very strange concept to make this insert our of what looks like sturdy cardboard since it has to screw into the sides of the hole. Seems like adding the tracks and drawers would be easy, but this is an insert that screws into the holes and has the tracks and drawers inside it. Works great for it's purpose."
00275848,"Perfect for every room!. Bought two for my sewing room, it’s perfect"
20275814,"i own several!. I love this system of storage. i have bought several of these for different places in my house. The are strong, stylish and literally have a piece that fits everywhere. this 2x2 cube is in my pantry, toy room and in my sons room. I only wish there were more options of bins, but i have found really cute ones that fit at Target in many more patterns!"
30275861,"Great furniture. Easy to assemble, convenient, looks great"
30275861,So happy!. This is the best use of space
90286649,"These used to be made of wood not cardboard. I bought this one because IKEA no longer makes the large drawer version (Why not?!). Also on the subject of things IKEA doesn't make, why isn't there a propper half shelf for the KALLAX system? I'd buy at least 4 of those badboys, instead we have this weird shelf that sticks out halfway. Anywhoo, the older versions of these were made of wood so they were sturdier without any storage space sacrificed. The new ones are made of cardboard and fall apart easily."
60275812,"gratis ,igual loved. Am so happy to by this furniture is gratis forma me."
60275812,"Simple, clean, solid build. I purchased two of these shelf units to use as night stands. They are the perfect height next to the bed. They are solid build, easy assembly and look great with the room. They also fit the larger cube size, so plenty of storage in the bins(purchased separately)."
60275812,"Perfect piece. This piece went together quickly and easily, and is the perfect solution to my need for extra storage. I added some fiber baskets and it's the perfect addition in my home."
20275885,"Great shelf. Excellent addition to our bedroom library, we love the kallax series. Will probably be back for more. A two person job to assemble tho!"
70301537,Perfect for holding games. This is the second one I have purchased because they fit board game boxes very well and are extremely sturdy.
80275887,"easy peasy. It was easy to assemble, clear pictures of how, but does require two persons."
20213312,"Well made. Very happy with our purchase, looks awesome"
79278325,RIGHT SIZE WELL BUILT. I BOUGHT THS FOR EXTRA STORAGE IN MY SPARE ROOM.....WORK AWESOME
20275814,"Fantastic shelf unit. Bought Kallax Shelf unit about a month, could not be more pleased, price unbeatable, love it."
00275848,Best Bookcase. Perfect height for my new library room. Plenty of storage with eye level top for art and objects. Wish they were still available in birch Vermeer.
20409936,"Purpose. I use it for a storage/display for my Dr. Marten boots, makes the room look good and neat."
20275814,Perfect space saver. Delighted with the look and feel! Since this purchase I have bought 3 larger ones to accommodate other areas in the house. Love love love them!!!
70286645,"Works well, missing piece.... I purchased 10 of these. They work really well and are smooth rolling drawers. However, one of the packages I purchased had a missing board and now I don't know what to do with it."
20275885,"Another product is better. Surprised, but I would not recommend. We bought this one, for $5 less than the Better Homes and Garden identical looking product sold elsewhere. The other brand had already shipped to our house(for free), and we needed 1 more, so I went to Ikea and bought this one. My husband put them together at the same time and we were SHOCKED to see that the other brand was a better quality, sturdier installation method, etc. The $5 savings doesn't even come close to being worth it, and that's before factoring in the other one will deliver to your house."
20278167,Organization. This insert is perfect those of us that need to make use of every inch of space but do not want open storage. I have purchased several already and recommend it to family and friends.
80275887,". love this, use it for storage, lying sideways, not up."
10275862,"Looks very good and easy to assemble. It looks great, provides plenty of space for books and showcase other items."
60275812,as expected. Fitted my needs and space
10275862,My son loves it. My son wanted this for his apartment for CHristmas he loves it
10275862,Perfect for my closet. I reorganized my closet & this along with the storage cubes are perfect!
90286649,"Missing piece !!. There is a missing piece, one handle think it doesn’t came in the box !!!!!whe can I get it ?"
60275812,"Great size shelves w/slide in box options. We needed easily accessible options for a table top, and this was perfect to use with the slide in box options for smaller items or open to use with bigger items. Very pleased with the product."
40415601,"Just what I needed!. I have searched all over for a shelving unit that was tall enough, wide enough, and had enough space to store products, I found it at ikea. This shelving unit is just what I needed and I love it! It exceeded all of my expectations!!"
70301537,Love the look!. I love the look the kallax brings to my living room. But I had abit of an issue with directions they were not detailed enough in explaining how to put this unit together. I had a mishap and lost one of the cube panels and the dowels that go with that one panel.
70332124,"Directions unclear. While I am sure I will love it once it is fully installed, the process has been difficult and confusing and require 2 trips to IKEA, the second visit to procure the necessary hardware. Otherwise quality and design are fine"
80275887,Low price but low quality. I’d rather spend more and get higher quality. But the design is nice and functional.
70391038,"Solid, Perfect Fit. We bought two of these a month ago to complete a media area. The color is perfect and they feel sturdy. Also not difficult to put together"
20275885,"Great tv stand/storage shelf. I had my eyes set on a tv stand already but the second time I came back to purchase it my husband hated it and saw this shelf and said this would be great as our tv stand instead, I didn't even realize it could have be used as one. I'm glad he came and seen this because not only does it work out as a stand, the storage is great for all the kids toys, with the purchase of the storage boxes that are sold separately. The price is great as well."
10305741,Shelves degraded in quality. I bought 4 of these Kallax units and although they have a great design the shelving material has been substantially changed. I had to return 2 sets because I ordered glossy white instead of flat white. I was surprised the replacement box for the flat white shelves was so much lighter than the glossy white and also lighter than my prior purchase of same Kallax u it in flat white.  Turns out all the shelves are not made of heavy mdf material but are hollow with a honey comb strengthening system on the interior. Not great for doing Kallax hacks with the material.  The shelves are essentially hollow with poor support inside. DISAPPOINTED.
20275814,"Perfect for toys. I got the shelves and bins for our playroom and they are perfect! Bins are roomy and the clutter can be tucked away, out of sight."
80303437,Nice corner unit. Easy to install and it looks great.
70339291,Solid Shelving Unit. I got this and a Vittsjo laptop desk to go along with it for a very small bedroom that also serves as a guestoom and it's perfect. I just wish the bottom shelf also was wood.
10275862,"It collapsed. The unit collapsed, breaking all of the dowels and bending the screws. IKEA provided a full refund."
60275812,. Looks good! Functional! Matches an IKEA desk in the same finish.
20275885,Kallax shelf. I just finished putting together a Hemnes dresser so this was a piece of cake. Looks great and is solid.
70342199,"Where are the holes?!?. Love this piece for reasons stated elsewhere (aesthetic, functionality, etc.). However, why are there no pre-drilled pilot holes for the wood piece? I had to wait 2 months until I could find someone who could make the holes so I could finish inserting the wood screws.  Make sure you follow the directions carefully to make sure all the pieces are facing the right way."
40314640,"Inconsistent color. Bring back old design.. Nice gloss finish, but the white color is inconsistent between different lots/styles. I Purchased some doors and drawers at the same time and the doors are more off white than the drawers. I then went back within a years time to purchase two more drawers and those drawers are more of a pure white. Please do something to make the coloring more consistent. Please also bring back the old design where the door was a freestanding unit with thicker laminated wood sides instead of flimsy cardboard that must be screwed to the cabinet. Having to screw the doors to the cabinet takes away from the flexibility of the kallax unit as you can’t just move them around later."
90286649,"Changes the appearance of our wall unit. Love it. Decided to finally fancy up the old Expedit we use in the office. Bought a set of these drawers and love them. The install wasn't hard, but you need to follow directions. They look great and completely changes the look of the wall unit. We also bought some of the doors for other spaces and love the way it all looks."
70286645,Organization essential. These are great to have. I like a neat and tidy work space and these are great for that.
10409932,"Beautiful and Sturdy, But those dang wooden pegs!. The Kallax is absolutely beautiful. The shelf space is very generous, and the whole construction seems sturdy. The white colorway is a pure white, not cream-tinted at all. It makes for a beautiful book shelf, display shelf, or even room divider, since it is backless. The Drona boxes, shelves, etc. allow for a lot of storage and customization options as well.  BUT, the entire thing is held together with those little wooden pegs. There are 8 screws in the whole thing, at each of the outside corners. Everything else is wooden pegs. They are impossible to get in properly by yourself, and even with help, they are incredibly difficult. If your hands start turning red and hurting and you decide to break out the hammer, or try to hold it together and end up wobbling a piece, you may just break some of the pegs and be left wondering ""how am I going to finish this now."" Luckily, I did receive 2 extra pegs. However, that doesn't really help when the broken one is already stuck inside the shelf. So I had to break out the command poster strips and hold it together that way. Which seems to be working great, actually! I used 3 strips on each shelf connection that went pegless.  I do admit that breaking the pegs was my fault (and thus why I'm still giving this a 5 star review) but seriously, you're going to need assistance holding it all together until the final screws, and someone else's hands to rub raw from the wooden pegs after yours have taken all they can."
30275861,Worst bookcase every. I've gotten a lot of IKEA furniture and this the worst! I built it and as soon as I stood it up all the shelves fell and broke. The shelves are helped up by wood pieces that easily break. I want to return.
50339292,"Fantastic piece for an industrial look. The shelf is such a nice piece to look at in my new home, I’m so glad I was able to purchase it. It really goes well with my late grandpa’s steel worker figures. I also had some issues installing the doors, but what I did was screw the screws in little at a time and adjust the doors as needed before I screwed again. When I was putting this shelf together, I was working alone. As for not having a drill for the insertion of screws into the wooden planks, it’s incredibly easy to just press the screw into the wood where you want it to be and it’ll leave an imprint. It doesn’t require a lot of muscle, I don’t work out and have little lady arms. From there, hold the screw in place and press firmly with the screwdriver into the screw as you twist, just enough to keep it in place. I have a drill, didn’t use it. Start with the middle points, they have the best access points in terms of hand space."
70342199,. This works wonderful in my sons room. We love it and it is very sturdy and nice looking.
20213312,Great addition to my den. My den is furnished with a lot of high-end items so I was concerned this wouldn't fit in with the quality of my items. I was wrong! I needed something tall and thin to use for display of photo frames and this is perfect! Very sturdy and looks like it costs twice the price I paid.
20275814,. I’m extremely satisfied and happy that I bought this item.
10275862,HORRIBLE!! Unsturdy. We purchased the Kallax storage cubes in the 3x4 cube variation and loved it so much we thought we should get another one just a little bigger. WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! We chose the unit with 4x4 cubes and it is a heaping pile of junk. The outer boards are bowed and the inside pieces won’t even go together all the way so you can see the pegs between the shelves. It’s so unsteady they give you a special bracket to mount on the wall to keep it from wobbling but IT WONT EVEN GO ON 2 STUDS!
00275848,We hung them sideways in. We hung them sideways in the garage. Great shelves!
90286649,Great idea/Easy to assemble. Great idea/Easy to assemble
80275887,"Beautiful and versatile!. I bought 4 of this shelf units and I think this is star product of IKEA ,is so versatile!!"
50339292,"Where are the holes?!?. Love this piece for all the reasons stated in the other reviews (aesthetic, quality, strength, functionality, etc.). However, I had to wait 2 months to finish the piece until I could find a friend with the proper equipment to drill the holes to insert the wood screws. Why can't IKEA put pilot holes on this? It would make it so much easier!!"
40415601,Great value and sturdy. I bought this to semi divide a room and have my sons toys in it. It is perfect.
09278338,Perfect. Now my craft/sewing room is organized !
20275885,. I bought Kallax Shelf and love it!
10345073,Great for desk and pantry. Use mine for bread in the pantry saves the bread from being smashed. Or great for a desk holds stock paper for craft desk.
80275887,Shelves. I bought and assembled 3 of these units. The third was cracked in multiple places and had to be brought back and replaced which was a major inconvenience. The shelves themselves are exactly what I wanted.
80275887,. We have these in all our kids rooms and love them! They're durable and a great price! Much better than Walmart brand.
20275885,Solidly built. The quality is way better then other places. Solidly built. I got this and the door inserts. Had to have an assist for the internet to understand the the instructions but other than that I love it. It’s also taller than the ones from Wally World and much better quay.
20275814,Great size and easy to put together. I love the 4 compartments and the fact that it looks different than a bookcase. Nothing against bookcases - I have alot of them - I wanted something different.
90286649,Great idea. The idea of modules you can put in your shelving system is pure genius. These drawers work well and look good. With a tiny amount of thought they could have been designed to also provide structural rigidity to the shelf unit which would have really improved my impression of the overall system.
40346924,"great piece and affordable. Well made, versatile, great product"
60275812,"Love it!. Who doesn't love the cube systems from ikea? It's so versatile for holding items by my door, book case and front door table to put my purse on."
80275887,. Really good I love Ikea !!! My whole apartment is decorate with Ikea furniture
00314642,Love!. Perfect fit! Just what I was looking for:)
00275848,"So versatile. Bought to go with the other 3 Kallax units in my craft room. This unit will hold scrapbooks, coloring books and a few decorative pieces. Nice large boxes give you plenty of options for the items you want to store here. Clean lines of the Kallax give you a nice area for display and storage."
00275848,. I absolutely love these! I made them into a bench for my front entryway and it’s perfect!!
80401292,Great Wine Rack. Very easy to put together. Looks great and holds nine bottles of wine. Would reccommend.
70286645,Perfect for Montessori clothes rack. Bought three of these! Two I used to put besides a 1x4 to make a cute reading spot for my son. And the third we used to make a Montessori style clothing rack with drawers. They may not last for 10 years but they are definitely decent quality! Also very easy to put together. My toddler climbs on these all the time and they are super sturdy!
40346924,Great everything!!!. I bought this about 3 months ago and it is by far one of the best pieces of furniture I have!! An and it's so versitile. Every house should have at least one!!!
80275887,Sturdy & Good Looking. Bought one for my sewing room and for 2 kid's bedrooms for toys and books. Got some of the doors and fabric boxes. Look great and keeping everything organized. Sturdy and easy to assemble. Love this line.
50214678,Looks great in my living room.. I purchased 2 units to use side by side. Easy assembly.
50305739,Chic high end look. Using it as a night stand in my child's room. Works well with Target pillow fort canvas bins. Very happy with the purchase! Amazing price!
90305803,. It looks nice in my hallway.
80275887,great size. love them for my new sewing room
10305741,Sturdy shelving. Easy to put together. Used horizontal and has large cubbies
20275885,"Great piece of furniture. Looks great, easy to assemble and provides so much storage and display room"
60275812,I’ve put together other brands. I’ve put together other brands and this was MUCH EASIER. The quality is much better
40415601,"Looks great. Bought for guest bedroom. Looks great. Roomy for lots of stuff. No back to it, but it's fine."
50305739,"Kallax Just right again. Easy to assemble. This isn't the first time we have enjoyed using Kallax Shelves, for books or Holliday groceries. Always a winner"
20278167,Looks good but can be frustrating to say the least. I bought two drawer and two door inserts. The drawers are a breeze and hard to mess up. The doors.. not so much. If your Kallax isnt perfectly straight it shows in the installation. I have an elevated 8 cube set up landscape with 6 legs and one door went on perfectly while the other was slanted. I usually love building IKEA furniture and don't mind decoding the instructions but the section on adjusting the doors after installation really needs more clarification. After fiddling with the screws for a while I finally got it looking straight but it's very unstable and not something that could be used frequently. Also keep in mind that you can't adjust screws in particleboard very much without stripping the hole. These inserts are better for people who aren't bothered by minor imperfections otherwise it's a toss up. Note: another reviewer said there is nothing to stop the door from going in but that's not true. The insert is designed to be its own door stop if you put it in right.
90305803,GREAT SHELF. I ought this as a TV stand and fix great with my tv.
20275885,"Great Product!!!. I purchased this a few weeks ago as the main storage solution for my son’s nursery. I must say it was beyond easy to assemble, feels very sturdy and safe, and holds a TON of stuff! Great product!"
00415599,"3x3 Kallax. These Kallax are perfect. We have six in our house of various sizes, and dimensions. Excellent for my books and my vinyl LP collection collection."
70301537,. Fantastic for organizing our kids toys and art supplies!  Feels and looks solid and was easy to put together
60275812,. Bought this to store some books and other trinkets. Easy assembly. Perfectly matches my modern living room decor.
40303439,"love it!. I've been searching for ages for the perfect bookcase/storage unit. i wanted something light, modern, and not expensive - this is perfect! Easy to assemble!"
10275862,. I bought this product one month ago. I love it
10275862,Flimsy. Shaking too much not too sturdy
40275846,Nice looking. I bough this item about a month ago. I'm very happy with it.
20275885,Good quality. I like the design very simple. Quality wise worth the value of $65.
70286645,Organizers. These drawers and doors hide all my craft supplies and look very neat!
10275862,Classic Ikea. I always go back to this style bookcase and never disappointed.
70332124,"Terrible design. I've put together several ikea pieces, home depot shelving, as well as many others. This piece, as simple as it is, was extremely frustrating to put together. The plastic interlocking tabs, break extremely easy and DO NOT fit together very well. Shop at ikea, but stay away from this piece."
20275885,Perfect storage option. Holds a. Perfect storage option. Holds a lot of stuff! Attractive looking and easy to put together .
10305741,"great space saver. just fit perfectly under my window in my room, I really enjoy putting all sorts of nick nacks"
60275812,"Very nice shelving unit. I bought this shelving unit to use as a place to put our shoes when we take them off at the door. I love it! Not only are our shoes out of the way but with the baskets that can be purchased along with it, helps to keep hats and gloves out of the way too. I purchased another unit to have in my son's room for toys. It large enough to store lots of toys yet it doesn't take up a lot of space. It's very sturdy and was very easy to assemble."
70301542,Just was I was envisioning. This unit is a perfect addition to my home office that allows me to keep things organized and look nice at the same time. I bought colorful cloth boxes to fill some of the shelf openings which made it even more attractive
20275885,Awesome purchase!. Bought it for a college apartment for my son. Looks fantastic! Can be used vertical or horizontal. Easy to put together - I did it myself before he got home! Great item at a great price.
70286645,"Tricky to install, great for organization!. My husband and I have purchased and installed a few of the Kallax insert drawers and doors. The drawer insert is definitely tricky/time consuming to install, but the organizational benefits outweigh the hassle."
60275812,Great product. Great product
60278170,"The Door. I purchased the Kallax storage unit for my bedroom, to stand in as a dresser. This door makes the storage unit look more home like."
20213312,Makes the room look bigger.. Very easy to assemble; great looking. I highly recommend them to anyone working with a small space.
80275887,What i wanted. Im glad i did brought this doe my crafting area
00314642,Very nice. I love these drawers. I have the desk attached to my kallax set so I can't use them all over the boxes but would buy more if I could.
20275885,Easy to assemble. I bought two and they are perfect for toys placed on their sides long way.
60278170,Easy to assemble and install. Provides good space to put away things you don’t want on display.
60275812,"Nice shelf.. I bought this two weeks ago. They are to be used in a classroom that has tables. One of these shelves with be at the end of each student table to hold their books. They are great shelves, but a few were very difficult to get the pegs into."
00334536,"Works like a dream. Needed more storage in a tv cabinet that will never see a tv again, so used this inside and works like a dream."
30275861,"Looks beautiful but difficult to put together. So far, so good (day 2) - it's incredibly heavy - VERY HEAVY - when you finally stand it up you will need two people. I put together three pieces of ikea furniture this past week, and the other two were relatively simple, hour or two. This took like five hours. In putting it together some of the wood chipped because you have to hammer things to fit. Also make sure you have the room - measure it well. That said it's now sturdy and looks good. Once I conquered putting it together I felt like I climbed Mount Everest."
30275861,perfect size. Using it for my craft room. Fit the space just right. Went together fairly quickly though instructions could be a little clearer.
10275862,Perfect for Vinyl Record storage. The cabinet is great for my purpose which is to store my collection of Vinyl Records. I actually have a 30 X 30 4 cube Kallax unit stacked on top for additional storage.
40275846,Great buy. Works great. Great price. Sturdy. Versatile.
80275887,Fantastic for kid's playroom. My husband got this assembled within 15 mins. Perfect for my kid's playroom to house bins and books. Might get another!
20275885,Nice. Made such an improvement in storage and organization.
00314642,"Definitely not for storing DVD's. This was easy to assemble, fits in unit perfectly. It looks nice as well. Why am I giving it three stars? Ikea should put inside measurements of drawers. Unfortunately pretty useless for DVD storage. Glad I only bought one."
60275812,Great features. I bought this a month ago and am so happy
80275887,"Versatile storage. I bought this a while ago and love the versatility. It can be used horizontally or vertically, as well as with or without baskets or cubes ."
50339292,"So many screws. Some included. So many screws. Some included in the front directions but then never mentioned, never used."
20275885,Great multi purpose shelf unit !!. We own several of these IKEA shelves. They are so versatile. So many uses. Strong and sturdy.
40346924,Great versatile cube unit. I bought this almost a month ago. We had it as a shoe storage unit. Then we decided to turn it into a media center where we can have our house our nick nacks of places we have traveled.
20275814,"Looks amazing!. I have had these cubbies in Atlanta and here on Dallas and I just love them! They look beautiful, and they are versatile. A great idea is to buy the doors and drawers to hide all those little things that you don't know what to do with!"
20275885,Best book case on the market. Easy to put together. Sturdy. Inexpensive. Would really like birch color as an option.
80275887,"Looks nice, keeps things organized. Bought this a few weeks ago. Used fabric covered banker boxes to match decor. Looks great, holds a lot."
40334558,Excellent product!. This is a beautiful design!
20275885,. i love it...worth the money..just hate to set it up

20275814,Solid and easy to assemble. Solid and easy to assemble. Looks great in my son's room.
20275814,"Kallax and accessories. I did buy a 4 cube Kallax about 1 month ago after looking at it extensively as a storage solution in the kitchen. I also purchased 4, Drona boxes and it is working exactly as I hoped. Assembly was fast and solid, and everything has worked perfectly."
00415599,. Great looking product. Strong and easy to assemble.
70301542,"Great for teen bedroom. We bought this unit for my 13yo son's room, and it's a perfect addition. It's a huge piece of furniture, so putting it together took some time and a rubber mallet to get everything tight. Then lifting it was quite a beast...definitely a two or even three person job. But it only took a couple of hours, and the result is well worth the effort."
20275885,"Great Value!. My 13-year-old daughter assembled this bookshelf for me easily. It looks great in my bedroom and is just the right size. It holds many books, binders, clipboards, and a vase."
20275885,Perfect for bedroom storage. Easy to assemble. Good price
10345073,"Handy and cute!. Gold color was awful but it spray painted beautifully. Installed very easily and it looks great. Overall, an excellent addition!"

20213312,Great glass shelfs. Works great for displaying my Technic Lego's
20409936,strong and sturdy. bought this for my son for his bedroom and he loves it!
20213312,Looks great!. I bought this shelf to display house plants and it looks so great! Love the mix of metal and glass with the rest of the decor in our living room. Looks great for the price as well!
20275814,"Priced Right. Sturdy and well made cube organizer. It’s the best I’ve found, compared to others I’ve purchased. Easy to install. Would recommend this definitely ."
20275885,"Great Bookcase at Good Price. We have used the Kaliax bookcases for many years and continue to love the quality, versatility, color choices, and economic prices of your bookcases. I use them for storage and/it display in almost every room of my house."
70339291,"Really cute, easy to put together. I was hesitant to buy the shelf because there's a lot of reviews online about it being incredibly difficult to put together, but I didn't have any trouble at all. I think it took me about an hour, and I was working slowly. It feels sturdy all put together and looks really nice!"
80275887,amazing. I love this product help me to organize my kids school area at home.
70339291,Looks great !. easily put together by 1 person and looks really nice. A great buy. I like the whole line and will most likely ad on.
20275885,"Excellent!. Purchased this shelf to be used as a, stand for a 50 inch flat screen TV, in an extra bedroom of our home. Very easy to put together and it's the piece of furniture that's perfect for the room."
99017445,"Great product!. I bought 4 of these units to replace 15 year old Billy bookcases. They’re versatile, easy to put together and look so nice in my family room!"
60275812,I love my Kallax shelf.. I bought it a about a month ago to put in my motorhome. I needed something for a small space that i could secure to the wall. It fit perfectly and was very easy to put together.
20275814,"uneasy feeling. It is beautiful, light, sturdy, but the corner hardware to attache it to the wall appears to be insufficient. There are a total of 4 spots to screw it against the wall, but they only send you 2 corner hardware, not 4 !! Give me that uneasy chill when I place some objects on it. Will it fall?? OMG."
50339292,Love it!. Needed an extra storage shelf for our store and love it. Love that it has doors to hide extra inventory!
10305741,"Great storage!. I bought the glossy white unit because I noticed it wears much better on the displays in the store. With a toddler and another on the way, I need my furniture to hold up to as much abuse as possible. The unit is pretty and easy to assemble. My only complaint is that one of the internal shelves was damaged during production. I thought I'd be able to hide it since it's an internal shelf so I put the whole thing together but it's still visible. I need to put a storage bin in that cubie so it doesn't show but really am unhappy every time I see. The unit is too big and heavy to bring back to the store to exchange. But for what I spent, I guess I can't complain."
90495695,My favorite insert so far!. I love this! I do a lot of vinyl work and these Kallax inserts are perfect. I'm able to sort my rolls of vinyl so much easier than before. These inserts are heavy duty and putting them together is a breeze. The price is spot on as well. I can't wait to pick up a couple more!
70301542,Sturdy!. Nice piece! Super easy assembly. Feels sturdy to put all my stuff. I wanted to add lights to the top so I bought a few of the nice clip-on lights. The top and sides of unit are too thick to use a clip on.
70301542,"Easy assembly. Great finish & fit, does what it supposed to."
70286645,Love these. These drawers will be handy in my Kallax unit. Easy assembly and great quality!
10275862,. Great storage option for a limited amount of space!!!
70342199,Looks great with other Fjallbo items.. I purchased two of these shelves --one for either side of the Fjallbo TV cabinet. They look great and fit with it seamlessly.
20275814,Ikea cutting table hack. I purchased 3 of these and followed the instructions found in Facebook by women who use them for cutting tables. I love my table but just need ikea to make different tops for my table.
20213312,"Clean, easy and reasonably priced. We got this one and the shorter one for my daughter's industrial style room. It's very clean looking."
80275887,"Good but needs quality control. I bought 2 of these shelves for my kids playroom to replace an older expedit shelf that we moved to my son's room. The first shelf had 2 different pieces that had defects in the outer veneer, if I had seen them before I started building it then I would have returned it but I did not want to deal wuth the hassel of dragging it in (w/ my 2 small kids)to exchange it. Was able to readjust so the defects were on one side and just put that against the wall. Was very disappointed to see these shelves went on sale a week after I bought them... I couldnt get to the store for a price adjustment in time. Also, one of the shelves had double dowel assembly and the other only had single dowels... just strange that they weren't consistent. But overall, love the design and ease of assembly of these shelves!"
40415601,Perfect. Perfect size and use for my room
20275814,So versatile! So strong!. Thrilled with this purchase as I continue to buy them and create storage in our home.
50339292,"Love this shelf. I love this thing, it's gorgeous. The magnets are strong, the wood shelves are thin but strong and the paint is holding up well so far (2 months in). A warning: the wood shelves don't have predrilled pulling holes for the screws that attach them to the metal frame. Be prepared to measure and mark carefully."
20275885,. good furniture to make my storage space more
60275812,Nice quality look. Bought for a toy storage area. Great height and easy to assemble. Comes with wall mounts if I need them. Very sturdy.
40314640,"love the design but the back is not glossy white. I searched all over to see images or get info on whether the backs of the inserts are the same as the front, so when you use it as a room divider it has the same finish on both sides. I had to go to the store and find a cabinet with inserts and pull it away from the wall to see what it looked like. The birch finish is birch --- so I assumed the glossy white would be glossy white -- and it is NOT! It is plain white melamine. So now it will look tacky to have the inserts facing both ways. Otherwise, I'm glad these inserts are available to make the cabinet look more sophisticated, just wish they had not failed on this detail."
30275861,Awesome bookcase/catchall. Always happy with the Kallax shelf unit  I have several and I love them
20275885,8 cube brown/black shelf. Works great for what I need. Can place it standing upright 4 cubes high to save space or lay it on its side two cubes tall. Looks nice. Can add clothes bins or leave open to display things
20275814,. We have purchased three of these! One to use as a printerstand in our loft with several other components for a great office/creative space layout and two in our dining area to house cookbooks!
50339292,"Love the look.. We bought this a month ago and so far so good. We had a small problem with on door magnet not hitting in the right place, so we flipped the door and all works well. It's nice to have an area for display and an area to store games and blankets."
20275814,Perfect fit. I love this adaptable piece of furniture. It sits beside my desk holding paper and other desk accessories.
70301542,Long Time. Don’t get me wrong I love the shelf. But it was very hard to put together. As I hammered the shelf was falling a part. Once I stared using a rubber pad in between the wood and the hammer it was much easier to put together. But at the very top I would change the directions. To stand it up then finish putting it together.
00275848,"Great for closets. We bought six of these units over the past couple of months to customize our closets. Great in the master walk-ins for folded jeans, sweaters and tee shirts, in the guest room closet for towels and linens, and in my office/craft room for fabric, yarn, and files. They look great and keep things organized."
80275887,. This is my 4th purchase. I love these for my craft room . They are very sturdy and well constructed.
70342199,easy to assembly and looks. easy to assembly and looks great in my 4 seasons room.
80275887,Best tv stand. I bought this to convert into a tv stand for my sewing room because it also provides storage. Wonderful addition to my room.
80334603,Perfect size!. We needed some small cabinets for books and this worked great.
29278304,Works great. Fits my teenaged son’s needs perfectly in his remodeled room.
80275887,"Awesome storage unit!. Bought this unit for toy storage. I was a bit frustrated when I brought it home to find that we were missing a small piece ( a small wooden dowel). We couldn’t finish the unit without it and seeing as we live 30-40mins away I wasn’t about to drive back to our nearest IKEA. I’m also nesting so I didn’t want to wait for the piece to arrive in the mail, I just needed to finish it ASAP. Luckily we were able to find a replacement piece at our local ACE hardware store. I also noticed a small chip in one of the boards, it’s not very noticeable unless you know it’s there. Otherwise its light and sturdy and very easy to put together, I put it together with my 2 year old around and I’m 26 weeks pregnant. I’d purchase it again."
80275887,Great features. Purchased a month ago ages assembled it that same night. Super easy to do.
39278290,Smart looking. I love how much more storage this gives my first room. It is multipurpose without taking up a lot of space. Easy to put together.
60275812,"Great Shelf Unit. Versatile, easy to eaamble, modular. Love it!"
00415599,Great piece of furniture.. This is sturdy and a great piece of furniture in my new office.
20275885,"Best cube unit out there. I bought another brand and the Ikea one is so much better quality! I'll but more. Also, super easy to customize!!!"
00275848,. I bought 2 unit self and was happy to organize my stuff
10345073,Helps a lot!. Adding this to the cube shelves definitely
20275814,Great kids room bookshelf. I bought this item several months ago for my toddler's book collection that was getting to be too much. This is a great book shelf! We also have 2 more of these in the computer room with some baskets for storage. It holds a lot.
20275885,"Love!. We have a dozen of these and use them for numerous things, as storage for toys, clothes, bookcases. We love them"
30275861,Great for storage. Best system for sorage vinyl records
30275861,. I purchased this unit to put in a spare bedroom to store my quilt fabric. It's perfect to be able to see my fabric displayed and I don't have to look thru bins and drawers for the right color
30275861,"Great storage!. I bought this white cubicle for storage in my closet; eliminating my dresser.  I love the clean lines, size, and it doesn’t take a lot of space. It’s perfect!❤️❤️❤️"
70339291,"Came together well. I have had this shelf for a month now and it's holding up fine. The metal seems a little flimsy for all it's supposed to look industrial, but at this low price what do you really expect. The wood shelving is gorgeous - how it stands up to regular wear and tear remains to be seen. If I had a use for another I'd buy it again."
10305741,"Nice product - not too bad to put together. I really love the look of the white shelf unit and I purchased a table top, 2 legs and hardware to connect it to the shelf unit for a perfect workstation with storage!"
80275887,"Easy to put together, multiple uses. I've purchased so many IKEA Kallax units I can put the 2x4 unit together in my sleep. They're multi-functional and come in so many different colors. My current obsession is the walnut light gray effect, it's similar to the birch effect, but it's got more of a rustic look and feel. They're still hard to come by but it goes with my aesthetic perfectly."
90305803,great value. easily put together by 1 person. ( standard IKEA fare)
20275885,Good. I bought this for my daughter it fits in her place perfect
20275885,"Transformed my living space. sturdy, easy to assemble, great color, transformed my living space for the better"
20275814,"Sturdy..easy to put together..nice finish. I bought one for my sons room, he is 6, bins for his toys fit perfectly in the cubes..they are a great size! Went back a few weeks ago and got one for my daughter, she is 14. She puts her sewing supplies in the bins which hold a ton, and use the top for her display items. Great buy"
30275861,"Great. Bought to expand storage in my sewing room works great ,looks even better."
20275885,Shelf. Bought this same unit years ago and loved it. Bought one for my son and he is pleased.
90286649,A whole new look!. I love these inserts! I’ve had my EXPEDIT TV unit for approximalte 5 years. I upgraded the cubbies inder the media storage to both the door and drawers and it’s complately transformed my unit!
40346924,Really attractive. I have three of these placed horizontally to form a long counter and they look great!
10275862,"Smaller than unit bought previously. Same great quality as our previously purchased Kallax unit of the same configuration but about 1/2-1 inch smaller on the outer perimeter boards. As we bought this unit to stack it with our older Kallax units it matters but across the room it wouldn’t be very noticeable.  I admit that our older units are perhaps 10 or more years older and completely understand that IKEA can and should refresh and make updates to their products.  In our case I was not pleased to have missed the window for exactly matching our older units.  Having said that, I’d definitely recommend this unit as it is easy to assembly (especially when using a 9 yo helper), sturdy enough to hold a large number of books or other items and attractive. For the money, it’s a great addition to our household."
30275861,. I bought for my garage couple of months ago and using three sides for shoes and one side for some extra stuff on.I love it.
30275861,Awesome!. Looks good and it works for the purpose I bought it.
40346924,"Great looking room storage. Looks great, easy to assemble, provides good storage and display space"
20275885,. Love it the space great and size
60275812,Very nice. Am happy to have this product at home
60275812,. I bought these to replace a hodgepodge arrangement in my living room. They look great and are quite practical.
60275812,"Great for organizing. I organize brabies ,toy food, soft toys in the toy room,shoes at the entrance (every person has his own spot ),scarves,hats gloves. I have 7 of them all over the home."
50305739,"What the heck!!. Came with ugly marking all over!! Paid to have it assembled by a friend and he didn't know it should not have had these markings! This is terrible!! Taking it back and never shopping there again! On top of it all, the store people were not helpful or friendly! Thanks but I'll move on! If it would let me post a picture I would!"
40275846,Just what I needed. I have a narrow space between two closets and this fits perfectly.
20409936,"Always versatile. I bought this along with the 2x2 and the 1x4 Kallax units. I have them stacked with 3x4 on the bottom (4 wide x 3 tall) the 2x2 next with the 1x4 on top as a bridge. This has left a 2x2 “hole” on the one side for my computer. I have dubbed it “The Monstrosity”. So far (three weeks of use) it has been great. I love the flexibility of being able to stack and configure the Kallax units to fit a variety of needs. The only reason I didn’t give them a 5 star rating is the lack of connecting hardware. Although hardware is included to mount the Kallax units to the wall to prevent them from falling over, no hardware is provided to connect stacked units together. This is really important in a configuration such as I have created to increase stability in the whole piece. Granted, it was a simple matter to purchase the appropriate brackets at the hardware store and drill the pilots holes myself, but still, it would be nice to have such hardware included with the units. I’m sure people besides myself also stack these units in unique and creative ways. Including the brackets would be the safe thing to do. Also, the door and drawer inserts are not the most sturdy of design nor the easiest to install. Additionally, the door units never seem to be able to be adjusted just right."
50339292,Awesome as a bar!. We love using this as our bar in our apartment! Sturdy and good looking.
30275861,Fits my needs well.. I reclaimed my craft and sewing space. This fixture works perfectly in the space.
39278290,"Always versatile. I bought this along with the 2x2 and the 3x4 Kallax units. I have them stacked with 3x4 on the bottom (4 wide x 3 tall) the 2x2 next with the 1x4 on top as a bridge.

90286649,. I love them. The kallax product is cleaner and nicer!.
70301537,"Love this shelf unit. Using it as a divide between the living room and dining room and its a great size for holding dish ware, glasses and other items for the two places I have five white boxes across the middle set of shelves that look good and hold a ton of art supplies that no one has to look at!"
20275885,"Great storage. I purchased this unit in black/brown, the glass topper, and 3 of the woven grass storage baskets. It is a great value and I love the look, as does everyone who has seen it. A very versatile piece that is as attractive as it is useful."

70301542,"Easy to put together. This is very similar to the old square storage shelf, but it's much easier to put together. This one is put together vertically, so you don't have to have a large empty room to assemble it. It seems about as sturdy as the old one. My one complaint is that the same colors aren't available - the other two square IKEA storage shelves I have are both a natural wood color, which is not available in this type."
80275887,"Kallax 2 x 4 unit. We bought another Kallax unit to increase the storage space at our launching pad by the door to the garage. We had one there before with 4 spaces, but liked it so much that we decided more was better!"
20275885,Perfect. I went back and bought 1 more so now I have 3.
30275861,"Great organizer. Huge, awesome piece to organize toys, art supplies, every little thing that needs a home"
40346924,"Nice color that matches our home. We bought two a few months ago and make them a TV/living room unit. Got the drawers and the divider as well. Very functional. The best part is that the color matched with our newly built home. You can find many shelves in the market but with the color, price, and function, this is the best."
00275848,clean look. Easy to assemble. All parts included
50214678,Perfect for small space. I used the glass shelves all on top shelves and put lap on top. Lamp shines through glass down on all my nic-nacs. Sturdy. Fit great in my small corner. Watch closely while assembling.
10275862,Great value. Sturdy shelving unit provides amazing amount of storage and it looks nice too!
10409932,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. This was super easy to put together! I love how it looks, I love the functionality of it and I love the price! The height is perfect for putting items on top and it holds a ton of books and I have storage baskets on the bottom row."
60275812,Difficult to Put Together. I bought this to use in my classroom for storage behind my desk. The directions for assembly are very confusing- I ended up putting pegs in the wrong holes and then was not able to get them out because they were so tight- the pegs are made out of wood and one ended up breaking. I have put together many bookshelves and shelves before and this was by far the most difficult one.
20275885,Great storage unit.. I am using the unit with IKEA storage crate/boxes and am very happy with the amount of items I can store.
90305803,"Perfect size, nice clean lines. It looks great and was quick and easy to put together."
20275814,"Kallax. This is my fourth Kallax unit purchase! I have them in the kids playroom and bedrooms for toy storage.  I only wished the units came with white covers for the screws on each side, so you don't have to see them."
50334591,Love it but hard to assemble. I bought this very functional cube a few months ago. Instead of hanging it I stacked 2 as an end table. Modern look. My only complaint is the very difficult assembly. You must connect the sides in order and then pound on it to get them together.
20275814,"Missing piece. Bought this KALLAX shelving 3 weeks ago as I was moving and needs new nightstand. This was going to work perfectly. After the move I opened the box and began to assemble it. To my dismay, one of the boxes is missing a pretty important piece-the divider for the top shelf! I have tried calling for customer service but was never able to talk to a human and was hung up on by the automatic system. I attempted to do email as well but could never get through. So now I’m stuck with this piece of furniture that is obviously missing a main piece in the front. Disappointing."
70286645,Smooth runners. I transformed a Kallax unit into a sewing supply center with 4 sets of these drawers. It looks great and is very functional.
20275885,Flexible usage. I can use it vertical or horizontal. Add rolls. Change the appearance with different boxes and colors. It’s a timeless piece of furniture.
10275862,Sturdy and beautiful. The shelve unit is a beautiful addition to our small guest room. The cubbies hold extra sheets and towels for our guest and books and magazines . I should have purchased one sooner
40346924,"Modern style, Easy to Assemble. I bought this for our Kids Play Room and wanted the modern/grown up look which this particular color offers."
00275848,"Kallax to the rescue!. My teenager and I share a bathroom, the abundance of hair and beauty products was becoming overwhelming, and I needed a easy and economical solution. I am pleased as punch with my kallax purchase!"
70301537,Exactly what I needed to. Exactly what I needed to get my craft room organized!
70301537,"Bookcase perfection. I love these bookcases. They're elegant and yet simple. They offer seemingly infinite storage, and yet can be used as an airy room divider when placed behind the sofa. I alternate bright objects with empty spaces to keep an uncluttered look. I have also filled the bottom two levels with IKEA's cloth boxes to contain objects that don't need to be shown. Keeping books low on the shelves also helps weight them for stability."
80275887,Love these bookcases!!. I have a wall of these bookcases in my sunroom full of my favorite books. I have a wall of these bookcases and baskets in my craft/sewing room because they are a perfect way to store my craft supplies and fabric. I love them because they are so versatile and useful.
00415599,Great for Organizing and hiding clutter. Great product. Would suggest more staff in the area to help pull from the bin and load on cart.
90286649,"Just okay...... I had purchased Expedit cabinets and drawers in the past and was very happy with my purchases. When I needed extra drawers, I HAD to purchase Kallax, as Expedia was discontinued. I was quite disappointed by the product, the quality is by and far NOT as good as Expedia, neither is the 4X4 Kallax unit."
80275887,Love these Shelves. I have them in every room
80275887,Great for organizing!. I out this unit in my closet to organize small clothing items. My closet looks great!
80275887,"Decent shelving unit but not great. I bought 2 of these kallax unit shelves and for most people whose handy, it may be easy to assemble. I on the other hand, had to manually use my own screwdriver with whatever physical power I had...which it wasn't easy. Paper instructions are sucky as they only show pictures and don't actually give you any additional details of what you're supposed to do. It's basically trail and error kind of thing. You either get it right or you don't. I've had to take it apart and start over because it wasn't the right side or end...and that's with following the directions. Also the wooden dowels can easily go into the holes too deep or break if you're not careful. Once you manage to put everything together, it's pretty sturdy. I don't know about everyone else but I am not kidding when I say that it took me about 4 1/2 hours for one and another hour for the other one. This review is not to scare anyone from buying the unit but it's my way of trying to inform purchasers so they can make a more informative decision. It's really a nice looking shelf once it's done but unfortunately I didn't have the luxury of paying IKEA to assemble it for me so I had to do it myself."
60275812,Son room. Looks great and our 20 yr old came home from college and thought it look great in his room. Time for grown up furniture he can take when he moves out after college.
50214678,Ok. Needs a back brace to secure better
70301542,"Very flexible and affordable. We totally love the Kallax cubes. Perfect for our vinyl records, books and collectibles."
20275814,Great shelf. This is so well made and you can't find anything like it anywhere else for this price!! Best deal! Easy to put together
39285827,Looks great!. I bought this one and a couple others. I had a couple old ones as well. I love the addition of the picture to use for measuring purposes. It makes it so much easier ensuring the boxes all line up. I did a combo of three colors and it gives my daughter’s room that modern look o wanted in her room.
60275812,Great use of space. Bought this last month and love it. I needed a small space shelving unit and with the open back it fits with the heat duct.
60278170,"It’s okay. The previous door was just, a door, the connected box is something a didn’t care for but it looks good"
20275885,"Arguably the Best Shelving System for Vinyl. I bought two of these 2 x 4 Kallax shelving units, as well as an additional 2 x 2 Kallax unit and 10 matching Door Inserts for my record collection. I spent a LONG time researching these shelves: how many records they could hold without risking ring wear, if records would fit inside the Door Inserts (they do), etc., before pulling the trigger, but am so glad I did.  They look amazing in my study, and the shelves themselves show no signs of bowing under the weight of the vinyl. Finish is a rich, almost-black brown, and easy to wipe clean. Very sturdy, and relatively easy to assemble - it took longer to install the Door Inserts I purchased separately than it did to install the shelves. A very versatile, quality product that gives you peace of mind knowing your collection is well-housed. Definitely recommend."
40275846,Great product!. I brought these shelves several times this year. The shelves are very versatile and add style to most decors.
80275887,Great storage. I love the kallax bookcases I now have 5 in my house With the baskets they can clean up any clutter you may want to hide. For all my books they are Awesome. I’m planning on buying a few more very shortly.
70339291,"Not as hard as others advise. I bought this in Fl a few months ago and while it took me a couple hours to put together (had to re-do at one point because I didn’t fully read the instructions) it’s beautiful, sturdy, and perfect- I recent moved to MO and was worried that it might lose that sturdiness I’m the move somehow but it’s still holding up wonderfully and looks PERFECT in my downtown loft!"
80275887,Looks great!. Kallax holds a lot of miscellaneous things in the living room and keeps them neat. I have two at my office at work and two at home. I love how the Branas (and other) boxes are made to fit in the little spaces of Kallax for hiding the things that don't need to be out in view.
00275848,Storage. Excellent use for clothing in a small bedroom without taking up much space . It fit perfectly behind the door utilizing the unusable space ! Perfect !
20275814,"KALLAX. Great product. Sturdy, perfect size, perfect height."
19278328,love the look. this was so easy to put together and such a great look once standing! very pleased with the overall experience.
20275814,"Sturdy shelf. Excellent shelf, love it."
10305741,Great value. I have now purchased 5 of these for cubbies for our camp program. They are sturdy and easy to put together. The biggest challenge is getting the plastic protective coating off the edges so that's why I gave them 4 stars. For some of them I have just left it on since I can't get it off. Any tips?
80303437,"Sleek Design. I loved this item so much that I bought the bigger unit for open shelving purposes in my kitchen! This item is sturdy, practical and sleek design. Very easy to put together when using the included directions! Simple, but makes an impact!"
80275887,"Fast construction. This was probably the easiest build i have ever done from IKEA. I have also built similar products from other companies, but the KALLAX is the most sturdy by far."
50305739,"Love these!. I have 3 very small children so shelves that tip are OUT! These 4 cube shelves are wide and low. You can fill them with books, baskets or toys. Plus, they can be stacked or hung which means that even as they grow into teens theses shelves will grow with them. Perfect!!"
70286645,would love deeper drawers. I love the drawer options for the KALLAX units and have 9 sets between 4 KALLAX units. They were easy to put together and install. My only critique is I would have liked the sides to be taller to create deeper drawers so I may store more items inside.
80275887,Love this shelving. I bought this a few weeks ago and love it. I’m using it as extra storage and it’s compact design works perfect.
20275885,"Very Sturdy. Bought this because we wanted something our toddler niece could keep all her toys she plays with within reach. Worked out perfectly, she can easily pull out the cube bins which are all full of toys, make a mess all day but than when everything is put away it's back to a nice clean living room.  We constantly get compliments on the piece and they always want to know where we bought it. Absolutely love it."
50214678,Awesome. This was exactly what I’ve been looking for and the value is incredible. Very well made and functional. I plan on buying more of these once they are beck in stock.
70342199,"Easy assembly. Living in NYC kitchens come in small or x-small, this unit and a new kitchen table bumped us up to small"
80275887,"KALLAX for my crafts. This piece solved the problem for storing craft materials, especially yarn. Six Drona “bins” are in use, four with various yarns, sorted by weight/type. Two spaces were left open for decorative purposes. This is a great addition to my “office,” which had previously been a nursery/office.  Assembly instructions might have been better if they advised using a soft headed mallet, not a hammer, or perhaps suggest use of a board to protect the piece when pounding it together."
10305741,Easy to put together because of precious build. I have three different sizes in the Kallax Shelf units. This one was for my sister who has a mini-kitchen and needed more storage. She is amazed at the easy of putting this together and how much storage these shelves provide.
00334536,Love it. Love it
80275887,Perfect storage for my yarn. Needed a nice storage unit for my stash and thi unit is perfect
30275861,"Nice design and finish, Poor construction. The large 4 x 4 kallax shelf unit is only held together with wood dowels and long screws that go into particle board... so it wobbles sideways a bit. It doesn't have the metal and screw attachments that many other Ikea furniture has. I want to use it as a room divider so the end must be anchored to a wall so it doesn't collapse under the weight of the contents. A lot of storage space for the price, and it has a nice clean design. Requires at least 2 people to assemble."
90305803,Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for
10409932,"Perfect size. This is exactly what I wanted and it fits in the space perfectly. By the way, I put it together by myself even though it said for two people, it wasn't that hard to do."
20275814,. It’s just great it looks good and has many uses
40275846,Sturdy!. I bought this for my Mom about a month ago. I put it together - easy! Looks great & exactly what she wanted.
10305741,Perfect!. I have a slide in closet and I have so many clothes and not enough room to put it I could not find a way to keep my clothes organized properly so I change my doors to bifold so I can see my whole wardrobe. Then I’ll put the shelf inside. The measurements are EXACT. I was hoping it would be slightly smaller like one of the comments said but yes it was exact size so I had a little bit of trouble putting it into the closet but when I got it in omg. My stuff has been so organized since no more mess or digging through boxes to find my clothes. I love that I’m able to now stuck my clothes in the bins and have each individual been separate for clothes. It’s also worth the money because My friend suggested to just buy individual squares and put my bins in but they’re normally around $20 each and if I got 8 of them you would be paying over $180 easily that way. But this only $69 and with bins it was like $110. I also love that I can customize this into cabinets or doors later on if I wanted to.
80275887,Good price. Good price
40346924,"Off the Record. Excellent value, easy to put together. Now a Record Case in good standing."
10305741,very practic!. I already have bought few of them I used them as night stand and as a dresser.
10275862,Missing parts. Broken pieces as well. Will be returning when store open.
60275812,"Love it!!!. Great piece, easy to install, very sturdy!"
80275887,"Kids room bookshelf. Professional Installed it horizontal on the wall about 12 inches off the floor. Extra heavy wall brackets to secure it. Using as a toy/bookshelf, very neat and tidy compared to before."
40346924,"Sturdy, Stylish. I previously owned a Kallax bookshelf. It made it 7 years and 2 moves and 2 owners. It extremely sturdy. Easy to put together."
70301537,Perfect!. Bought this to store my quilting supplies. It is just right for this purpose.
20213312,"Great shef. Bought three shelves, two tall and the smaller one to place between. Spry painted gold. They look great"
40415192,Great unique size. Really enjoying this shelf - its made out of real wood and has a sturdy feel - definitely needs to be mounted to the wall to feel super stable. We put together in under an hour with 2 people. Adjustable shelves with a lip at the back so small items dont fall behind the unit!
00275848,Works perfect!. I bought it for our bathroom to house extra supplies and we love it!!!
60275812,Versatile and attractive.. I bought this shelf unit for a wall in my living room. I also purchased the baskets that fit on each shelf. Love it. It hides my stack of magazines and is an easy place to store clutter when guest come over.
00275848,"Perfect extra storage/bench. Easy to put together, perfect for extra seating & storage. This is my second unit, so now I have a perfect corner sitting area in my sunroom."
20275814,Very sturdy!. I love this shelf! I bought it for my daughters room and it is perfect for storing all of her toys.
79278293,I abolutely LOVE this unit!. I love my Kallax! it is very sturdy and looks wonderful in my craft room. I wish it came in 3 sections but i'm making the 4 fit. it is wonderful!
70301542,"Great Purchase. We love this case, we now have a wall of bins near our front door with shoes that are out sight and organized."
70301537,"Amazing storage. I bought this a couple months ago and it's better than expected. Lots and lots of storage space, the bens that you can purchase for it hold so much stuff."
30275861,"Does anything. I bought this to use in a great room for my grandkids. I've got books on some shelves, toys stacked on others. Things for little ones on the lowers shelves, things for the bigger kids on the higher shelves. Perfect for this!"
90286649,Happy with drawers. Works well. I use it for gadget documents and booklets. Nice way to create drawer storage. Simple to install. Hopefully it will hold up over time. Will probably purchase another for an older Expedit model.
50339292,outside table. This was purchased for a TV stand out side on a covered porch. lots of screws and bolts and two of us spending 3 hours to put together.
20213312,"Great space filler. I recently bought this item Nov 2017, very nice and sturdy. Build slowly as the instructions as very minimal details, will save you time. I had an empty wall that needing filling and this added a lot of character to the home. Very good price."
60275812,GOOD!. GREAT STORAGE! SUITS THE SPACE..
80275887,Minimal and functional!. Minimal and functional!
20275814,Fits perfect! Love all the shelving and storage op. Fits perfect! Love all the shelving and storage op
20275814,Functional piece and worth the price. Bought this for my son’s room as a tv stand/book shelf. Lowered the stars due to missing parts. Several dowels were missing so we were unable to completely secure the shelving in one section. Other than that it was easy to put together.
20275814,Awesome shelf. I bought this a month ago as a diy ikea hack that I found online. Making a doll house for my niece. Shopped around and this one was the most sturdy and 5$ less than anything I found at other places. Took 10min to build. Overall very happy with this find. It's sturdy and solid and super cute.
20409936,. Bought the shelves three weeks ago and it is great. Fit our needs
60278170,"Customize the Kallas. I have an 8-square black-brown Kallax unit, and filled the top row with 4 of these to conceal our book collection. The bottom row has Branas baskets for toys. Overall, I like the effect, but I wish that there were different options of pull knobs, as these tiny metal ones don't go with my decor. Not a huge issue, though. They were not fool-proof to install, but hide mistakes well if you screw up, haha. I like that the back of this insert is colored, so you could use it as a room divider if needed."
80401292,works perfectly. It fits in the cubby in the IKEA shelving units perfectly. I like the little sticky bumpers supplied for the edges of the shelves so it makes a secure fit.
40415601,Great shelf. Love this storage shelf. Very sturdy and looks more expensive than it was. Definitely recommend!
70339291,Broken out of the box. Today we drove 1.5 hrs to our local Ikea to purchase this unit. We no sooner get it home then find that 3 of the permanent welds to hold the shelves up were poorly done and the side piece broke into 2 pieces while trying to assemble the unit. When we contacted Ikea we were told we would have to make the 3 hour total round trip to fix their mistake.  Very disappointed
70286645,Awesome addition for my Kallax!. This item has definetly added a whole other level of organization to the Kallax. I especially love the look. It appears very sleek and clean. The possibilities are endless with these!
90286649,. Very happy with my shopping experience and quality of products at Ikea.
80275887,"Splendid design!. The product is well done, simple, beautiful and practical"
20305745,"Great look. I needed something for my craft room that was not only clean lines but functional, this fit the bill perfectly!"
60275812,. I bought this for my sewing room. Fits great love it
20213312,. I love this shelf! It's clean lines really showcase the items placed on it. It is very sturdy when attached to the wall. I do wish that it was a bit more sturdy without attaching it to the wall.
60275812,Perfect for our use. We bought this to organize shoes and misc. in the bottom of the closet instead of them strewn over the floor. Does the job perfectly. Looks great. Almost a shame to hide it in the closet. Would also be perfect with baskets to organize clothes or toys. Highly recommended
10305741,"Great addition. Easy to clean. Easy to move, but sturdy enough to hold a lot of stuff."
20275885,". Bought this to go in my kitchen as a cookbook holder. Works great, sturdy with the weight of all my books. Use it on it's side."
80275887,Perfect!. This was the second I have and I love them both!
60275812,Sturdy. Nice and sturdy for a great price!!
20275814,perfect cube storage. It's a compact cube storage unit that fit the space perfectly. Directions were alittle vague but I appreciate that they recommended 2 people to put it together.
20275814,". I bought this about a month ago, and I absolutely love it. I filled it in with a wicker basket type of look, and it looks amazing. Plus it’s a nice way to store things away without looking so ugly. Also, it was an easy thing to assemble."
60333954,Can't put it together!. My husband and I are IKEA pros - but this design is impossibly hard to put together! There is no hardware so the pieces are meant to simply interlock together - but neither of us can get the final piece to push in for either of the units we bought. I get that IKEA assembly takes patience - but it shouldn't require Herculean strength. Sadly returning. :(
20275885,Soo useful and attractive. I purchase this shelf unit and am going back for 2 more as they are so useful and really help control clutter I need the new ones for my sewing /craft room == i love Ikea products and ideas...
80275887,". We set this up horizontally for toy storage. It's perfect. Plenty of space for bins to contain the chaos. Pretty easy to set up and didn't take long at all, maybe 15 minutes."
50334591,Great addition. This cabinet works very nice hung on the wall for display
10305741,Very sturdy. This was perfect for my craft room. I’m still searching for baskets. Most basket sets come in sets of 6 and this has 8 slots! Assembly was easy. My 13 yr old son helped me put it together!
20275814,Great shelving. I purchased one and then went back and got another - very well made and worked great for my craft area.
20275814,"Good for small spaces. Pretty easy to put together, and it looks great if you have a small space to fit."
50339292,. I bought this almost a month ago. It was simple to assemble and had the wood and metal look I wanted for much less than other furniture stores.
20275814,"Need to offer birch finish. Functionally great product but need to bring back the birch finish. I previously purchased this product in birch now I wnat to buy two more and can't match them. Also, need to bring back the Lekman boxes in the color red."
60275812,Perfect for my 3 Binders. I needed a shelving unit for my Genealogy Binders and was happy when I shopped Ikea and found this unit. It has the perfect dimensions to fit 3 of my 3 binders.
80275887,"Great product!. We bought three of these in the last month. They were easy to assemble. When one peg broke off, the exchange was simple and quick. They provide a lot of storage for not a lot of money. I love our Kallax!"
10275862,"Great storage. I shopped for this, specifically for crafts. The product is sturdy and attractive. The inserts available are perfect to hide away the clutter. I am very happy with this. I bought black."
40346924,great color. materials are lighter than expected but easy to carry and move around. It does require 2 people to assemble.
00314642,Easy to install. Happy with this item. Wish in cane in more colors!
80275887,Using with linnmon as desk. Perfect size for desk compartments. I assembled myself in about 30 minutes.
20275814,Looks amazing.. East assembly snd looks great. So pleased.
10305741,". Easy assembly, sturdy once up, looks great. My only advice/complaint is not to use a hammer to pound in the pegs, the edges of the laminate will chip. Unfortunately, my hand is not up to pounding zillions of pegs in."
40275846,"Perfect match!. I bought this during the home organization sale as a book/cubby shelf in my 3 year old's room. It works perfectly for holding books and cubbies of toys, and it matches his black-brown Hemnes bedroom set perfectly!"
10305741,excellent. Bought two to form a work station and i am very pleased.
20275885,easy to assemble. I bought 3 of these for our new business to display products. I turned it on the side so works perfectly underneath display windows as well.
40415192,"Very nice. Like all of my solid wood IKEA furniture, this piece is a real winner! Love it!"
60333954,Great look and easy room. I bought it and return it because it missing piece or broken. I bought it same one again. look everything in one places. look good.
70301542,". I bought this about a month ago. It’s perfect for what I need it for and looks nice in the area that I have it in. The only thing negative that I have to say about it is the wooden pegs, they were kind of a pain. Just when I would get the peg in it would loosen up somewhere else. I am hoping it will last."
20275885,"great material. materials are great, very sturdy. need 2 people to assemble but finished in about 15 mins."
10409932,Kallax. Nice product .. easy to follow instructions and construction .. just not real tight after final assembly .. could be a bit more solid in stature ..
50214678,Love This Piece!. I bought this shelf unit for our recently renovated bathroom and it looks fantastic. It's a quality piece. I love it.
20275885,"Great futures !. I bought this like a 6 months ago ,and I happy to have it in my kids room for toys....."
70301537,"I love this so much. I'm so thrilled with this shelf unit. It's huge with 25 cubes of storage space. I was able to put this together easily with my teenage daughter. It's looks so clean and fantastic in my office, I'm really happy with the purchase."
80275887,"Perfect Storage Solution. Perfect for kids room! We have one in each kids room, will buy again."
20275885,. I have bought several of these units for my parents and they are so durable ..recently got one with my friend and she loves the quality of the product and price point.
80275887,Good price and quality. Very happy with my purchase. Use every shelf. And it was very easy to match bins of right size for it.
70391038,"Excellent quality, attractive, solid. I am very pleased with the quality of the Havsta shelving unit with base. I put it together solo with no issues in a couple of hours. It looks terrific and feels very sturdy. We purchased a Hemnes bookshelf at the same time for a different room and it feels much cheaper and flimsier in comparison with the Havsta."
00275848,Quality Product. This was the first item I purchased from IKEA and was very impressed with the quality and the easy to follow instructions. Over the years I have purchased several other brand DIY products and none had better forethought and quality construction items as this product. I've since purchased an 80 cabinet with similar results.
80275887,"Great for a toddler. We use this with 4 different colored bins on the bottom, and it has really helped tidy up our playroom. Our 21 month old can reach all of her toys, and we can tell her to get something out of the purple bin or out of the orange bin, without actually having to show her where we’ve put stuff away."
70342199,. I bought two almost a month ago. They were easy to assemble and they had the industrial look I wanted without overpowering my small living room.
20275885,"used to be good. This was our third Kallax unit to buy - we liked the first two and with a move to a new house, we thought one more would fit just fine. And it did. But. This time the quality was not as good as before. One of the edges wasn't glued properly and was afar from the body right out of the box. I don't know how to avoid this. I definitely won't take the unit apart and drive it back to the IKEA store another 50 miles just to replace the defective part. But it's not even an option to open the box and check all the parts in the store... So... The product is fine but just be prepared for lowering quality. I really hope it's not a trend for IKEA but just my bad luck."
50339292,Good looking and Sturdy. They have convinced the man who built out my pantry that he needs to stop IKEA bashing for good!
00334536,great for an update. I bought this for a bathroom cubby for towels etc and it works perfect in my tiny closet bathroom. It is standing up great against the humidity of the shower as well :)
10275862,Love this unit!. This is the second unit this size that we bought. One was several years ago and we used it as a bookcase. This one is used in our home office for various purposes. Some of the cubes have bins for small storage. We also have other smaller kallax units. Perfect for organizing and they look good also!
20275885,Great piece of furniture. This is my second one. I had to sell my old one which I had 5+ years because of moving couple of states over. I just had to come back to it
70301542,"Looks Decent Practical, but NOT Easy as Expected. I bought it about a month ago. Had it delivered through a 3rd-party delivery service. I assembled it with the help of my wife. Assembly wasn't as easy as I expected, not because the instructions were complicated, but because this piece is quite heavy to handle. My recommendation is to secure 3 people to do it. And I wished IKEA had shipped some extra wooden dowel pins. Only 1 extra pin was shipped, and two got broken as I tried to assemble it."
40346924,"Love the look. Really pleased, would definitely buy again."
40314640,looks great. Keeping everything neat and tidy behind closed doors.
70286645,"Lots of space!. We bought Kallax shelves because they look nice and are so flexible. We got two sets of these drawers for them and they are even better than I expected. They feel high quality and they hold much more than I expected. It fits construction sized paper, so perfect for an office or craft room. I would and probably will buy more!"
70301537,"Awesome Features. I’m extremely happy with the shelf unit. Works perfectly in my hobby/craft room. The options to add drawers, doors and baskets for storage and organization are endless! Love it and looks amazing!"
90286649,"Easy assembly and sturdy drawers. Nice product which serves my purpose. Drawers aren't that deep but, that helps prevent me from filling them with a bunch of unnecessary stuff."
10275862,"Tons of storage. Height is great though I probably would've liked the next size bigger! Husband uses for office storage, puts printer on top and matched nicely with desk we bought from IKEA years ago."
89278301,Office Storage. Bought this for my home office. I Love it!!! It looks amazing and offers so much storage. Great Buy!
10345073,"Great piece!. I bought this to add to my Kallax shelf, and it is brilliant helping me stay organized in my office. Love the color too. Thank you!"
70301542,Great function and appearance for the value!. Shelving unit is incredibly easy to assemble and sturdy! Eventually we will add on the accessories i.e. drawers and doors and lights.
70339291,Sturdy and Stylish!. Love this piece!! Easy to assemble and looks good with most styles!
20305745,"So Many Options. I love the glossy white finish I chose, as well as the many options available to customize the unit. Right now I am using it with all open cubbies but I've started a list for additional parts to make it exactly what I need. The only down side was assembly. It wasn't bad, and I have assembled many many products over the years, but until I was about 1/4 of the way through, I did chip the finish off some of the shelves (caused by trying to squeeze dowels into some very tight holes). It was minor, but still annoying. And the final two screws required some finessing because the unit was a bit off square by the last row."
20275885,"Versatile Product. I initially inherited one from my roommate that became a TV stand. A month later, I went to Ikea to buy a bookshelf hoping I'd see a nice affordable one and came to the conclusion that I could buy this again and turn the top shelves into a library and store items in the bottom. Then another few weeks later, I came back to get a particular sideboard but find they were out of stock and decided to use this shelf again with some added drawers and doors and it worked out perfectly! Even though we have 3 similar looking shelves in the living/dining area, the different colors and combinations make them look different enough to seem like it's own unique furniture."
70301537,Love the piece. Need a buddy for assembly. This piece works perfectly in my space. I had s little trouble with assembly but that's only because I needed another set of hands given the overall size of the unit.
20275814,. I'm so happy I bought this. I used it as the bases for my craft table
50305739,So practical!!. I bougth 2 and I used them as nigth stand. It saves me a lot of space!
20275885,"It's really not worth the money paid. Bought the grey lacquer one. Put together yesterday the gaps between the each pieces are so wide. afraid of break the lacquer surface, we used towel wraped hammer to get the pegs into the holes. lacquer surface broke. now the unit has gaps between each pieces."
00415599,Toy storage savior. We have two of these in our family room for toy storage. (Girl - Barbies galore) Bins with labels purchased from amazon make it easy for kids to clean up and find the toys they want to play with.
20275814,"Finally... simple, clean storage. Love getting all those misc. items off my floor & hidden in stylish boxes."
20275885,Great Organize Shelves. Great unit to keep school stuff organized on a day by day setup instead of all over the place
40275846,"Just what we were looking for. We were looking for some shelves to display our record collection , and the Kallax shelves are just perfect for that. They were very easy to put together and look great!"
80275887,Great cabinet.. Glad I got these with boxes. A lot of storage. Got 2 of these. Looks great and very functional. Works great for storing all the fabrics in.
40415601,. I'm happy with this product
20275814,Awesome... for boyfriend's daughter's room. She stores her toys inside of it and we put a couple of drawers in it so they're hidden and all together. Great for storage and easy assembly.
40415601,Great shelf unit. I bought this for my craft room and it has been a great addition.
19278253,Bought today..... Bought this unit today and put it together by myself. Just having the pictures almost proved to be a challenge but after a few minutes it all clicked. I am very impressed with this product. This is my first time ever going to an IKEA store and this was my first purchase as well. So far....so good!
80275887,Perfect!. Gave us so much more organizational space in our closet!
10275862,"Great quality for the price.. Much better the expected for the price. Looks great, and not too bad to put together."
39285827,Love it. Bought it about a month ago and love how it looks in our son's room. More colors would be even better!!
50339292,. Works great in the space and very nice looking with tv on it. Functional
10275862,. Excellent for clothing storage.
19278253,. Perfect height and perfect size.
70301542,"Great storage. I bought this a month ago, and I am so glad I did. I was looking for a piece of furniture that included storage. This is perfect. I also purchased the storage bins. The two of these are the perfect pair."
30275861,Great as a divider!. So happy! Good divider nice high! versatile!
20275814,. Excellent product. Very easy to assemble and it looks great.
20275885,Nice accent piece. Easy to put together and looks great on any room..love the storage space with the boxes
60275812,"Very difficult to assemble without damaging. There was no way to use a screwdriver to tighten the many fasteners that hold this together, necessitating the use of Vise Grips or very strong hands. Furthermore, during assembly undue strain was put on some of the connected pieces of particle board. This is not one of Ikea's better designs."
60275812,Unfortunate. I bought this Shelving unit today and once I got home I attempted to put it together. Once I started hammering the dowes in the shelf started to crack. It not happy with my purchase.
70286645,"Perfect fit to any IKEA storage units. Easy to assemble, fits perfectly into my IKEA storage unit which I bought few years ago and yet it looks like these drawers were part of it from the beginning!"
60275812,"Shelf unit getting smaller than in past. I have owned 2 of these shelf units for the past 5 years, and they are very sturdy and convenient. I purchase 2 more recently, and found they are now slightly smaller in size and less sturdy. I could not stack the 2 new ones against the 2 older ones with the noticeable size difference, so had to put the 2 older on floor side by side and stack the 2 new ones on top with about an inch showing at each end."
40415601,Love the color and shelving unit as a whole. We bought this to store baby items instead of using a traditional dresser. We were able to put it together quickly without any problems and loved how there was a lot of different colored Drona boxes that are compatible.
20275814,Perfect size. I bought 6 of these for my kids rooms a two months ago. Very happy with the purchase.
40415601,Exactly what I need! Great value for the price. I have tons of books and decor and a 40-inch TV on top of the shelf. No problem so far! Everyone that visit my apartment compliments the unit.
00275848,Quick and simple assembly. Purchased this a month or so ago. It was quick and easy to put together. We having it laying flat on its side next to my daughters bed. I (220lb male) will regularly sit on it and read my daughter bed time stories. Have felt a wiggle or a heard a creek. It seems to be very sturdy and wonderful storage
60275812,To heavy for wall mounting.. Found unit to heavy to wall mount with out major extra hardware. I ended up having to place on my dresser.. which worked but not why i purchased.. wanted wall mounted.. hardware was lacking for that purpose.
80275887,"Love this shelf!. Perfect to organize! I bought the 16 cube one, and purchased 8 of the IKEA cloth bins. Buy the IKEA bins they are huge and fit the space - unlike other bins you see elsewhere which are much smaller in size."
60221683,"Liked it!. Perfect Pantry, Happy to have it."
60221683,Perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy. A lot of room to use with Srubb boxes
30275861,Great shelf!. This is the perfect fit for my needs in my home office.
20275885,Awesome for kid's room. Keeping my daughter's cute room organized is easy with this unit.
30275861,Had to have.... I purchased a Kallax book shelf in my first home and loved it...we couldn’t move with it...so I got one for our next home for the shared living/dining room area and just got another for my craft space to hold fabric and my other fabric supplies.
20275885,"Perfect for an office/play room & functional. I am very impressed with this product, it’s perfect for my daughters toys and books/supplies for my office space. Very pleased and easy to build since my husband could not help me build it"
50339292,"Looks great. I ordered two of these and they not only look great, they are very sturdy."
40334558,. Nicer than expected and a breeze to assemble...snaps together
20305745,. I love it! Very nice. :•)
80275887,Nice to have different sizes of these units.. I have a combination of Kallax units for one wall in my sewing room. They can be used on top of each other and the different combinations made it easy to custom make my room.
20275885,good storage. Bought this to help storage in a closet. Works great and has baskets and other options that makes it very adaptable to our needs.
20275885,Perfect storage. These shelves were easy to put together and are good quality. They are nice and deep to give lots of storage space.
70286645,"Looks good but drawers are shallow. The 2-drawer unit is very easy to assemble and looks great inside my bookcase. I have THREE of these IKEA bookcases and just love them so I bought the drawer insert to see whether or not to get more. The main problem is that, unlike other IKEA drawer units that I own (e.g., a desk cabinet and a bedroom drawer set) the insert drawers are very shallow; the front of the drawers makes them look like they'd be deep but the fronts of the drawers mask what are very, very short sides so the unit provides much less storage space than it could if the sides were just a bit higher."
10305741,Good. Good
70342199,Looks great.. Bought this for plants and cookbooks. I have my cookbooks on lower two shelves and that weights this shelving unit enough to feel more stable otherwise I would attach to wall as it is light. Angles across corner of dining room and looks great in dining room.
20275885,Solid perfect fit for space. Assembly was simple and put to good use in no time
80275887,Perfect fit for storage in the bathroom. This was a great purchase for price and quality. Love it.
00314642,Wow!. These drawers are so much more useful and aesthetically pleasing than we imagined! Very easy to install in our black kallax unit and look lovely while providing much needed organization. We plan on purchasing more so that we have an entire row of the drawers.
80275887,. Love it. So simple. Easy to put together but definitely easier with two people.
70339291,Great!. Great product to use as a room divider!
10305741,"Good Looking-It puts the FUN in functional!. I bought this for a pantry shelf. All parts were in the package, no damage, packed to win! Good exercise building it on the carpet."
60278170,Easy Assembly. This is the ninth door I've bought. Have had no problems assembling and installing these.
20275885,Was so easy to put together.. I got it in sale for $50. It was so easy to put together (I did mine alone by assembling it on the box and rotating up and down and using a piece of cardboard from the box to create a gap for lifting on each side). I am using it sideways like a buffet and got white inserts for my storage. I also picked up some baskets from Target to insert into my unit.  I love it! Looks fantastic!
40346924,"Great shelf easy construction, need matching inser. I bought it for my dining area and it enhanced the look of my room; although, this cute color and walnut colored shelf doesn’t come with a matching shelf insert/door that is disappointing. Bought white doors and trying to use some matching contact paper as a DIY."
50334591,"Difficult to assemble!. I bought 2. I’m going to return both the one o assembled and the one still in the box. Too difficult to assemble!!! By the time we got the back piece inserted, it was bent and cracked. Hot mess! Not worth the money. Don’t but!"
50339292,"Great looking piece. Love the piece. It was tedious to put together...NOT typical for IKEA item. But it does go together easily, just a LOT of steps. It's sturdy and nice to look at once complete."
70301537,Lovely Piece. We bought this storage shelf unit for my husband’s man cave. And it is perfect for what he needed.
10305802,"Light and open shelving. Bought this piece to display several dollhouse room boxes. It’s open and glass construction allows for a panoramic view of whatever is displayed. Easy to assemble, not too big, and has clean and modern lines. Will likely buy another!"
60275812,"Organizational Plus. Purchased this item to put on top of my mom's small dresser in her nursing home room, where it fit perfectly. The cubbies really help the nurses keep medical supplies organized in their designated cubbies, and my mom's things in hers. By adding some vertical height to our storage situation, it was a huge improvement over the dresser top."
40346924,"Everything I've wanted & needed x4. This is my 4th Kallax/Expedit purchase as I have found numerous uses for them. They have versatile and practical. They can be used in any room of your home, they last and are inexpensive. Cannot recommend enough! I'm going to adding wheels this time for a more industrial look."
20275885,"Very satisfied with the quality,. Very satisfied with the quality, wish the larger ones were available."
70342199,Great Shelf - went back and bought the other one!. Really like the easy of assembly. Look at the instructions carefully. Had to take about half of it apart and put it back together again. Looks great. and my cat loves it!
80275887,. We had one that we use & love so I decided to get another & was not disappointed!
90286649,"Sturdy and Roomy. Instructions were easy to follow, assembly was fast, roomy drawers for the KALLAX shelves! Thrilled with our purchase!"
80275887,Easy to put together. I’ve been able to reorganize my small kitchen pantry. Love it!
50214678,Love!. We’ve had this shelf for a couple of months. It was exactly what I was looking for! Good quality and finishes off my living room.
40415192,"Easy to install. I bought this a few months ago and it has been a lovely addition to our home. It was very easy to install with step by step instructions and clear identification for each part. We use it next to our TV/computer/gaming system and were able to put our CPU, xbox and modem on the bottom shelf. The open space to the back allows for the cords to pass easily and not look unsightly. The other large shelf easily stores controllers, phone chargers etc and we use the top shelves for books, pictures etc. Very satisfied with my purchase."
40275846,Easy to assemble!. I like the product ! It was easy to assemble however i found once assembled it was heavy and when i attempted to mount to wall it ripped wall anchors right through wall.  So i now have them on floor.  They still work for me and will keep them but i would not mount them on wall unless you use extra supportive hardware. Now i have to fix my wall.. bye !
40415601,. Sturdy and good sized cubbies
59189472,Great. I bought it for my husband office. It looks nice
80334603,"Plastic connections broke when assembling shelf. I wasn't even able to use this product. The plastic connectors broke off when I was trying to assemble the shelf. I would not recommend this product to anyone who does not have wood glue, screws, and an electric drill."
70286645,. Love the look and how easy these were to assemble.
40415601,Looks great and functions perfectly. It was put together in about 30 min. For the price it has been a great purchase. I receive a lot of compliments on it.
70301542,"Incredibly Useful and Show Piece. I absolutely love this storage piece. Not only is it incredibly functional it's also beautiful! The dark wood plus being able to display whatever I need I know I will be using this for years to come. Currently it is in our bedroom and provides ample storage for everyday things that we can keep in bins, use some for display of sentimental items, and books and DVDs. It's Great and so functional"
20275885,. Bought this for our 10 year old’s room! Great shelf!
70342199,"Sturdy, good looking, great price. this is a great unit. love the look and ease of assembling. i got 2 and put one on either side of my fireplace"
30275861,"KALLAX are the best bookcases ever. The book case is a complete success. I marvel at the packing and packaging, all those pieces in 2 flat but long boxes. My daughter and I got them home and into the garage. We are rather elderly so my husband opened the boxes and took the pieces downstairs where we wanted the book case placed. Once all the pieces were downstairs, putting the book case together was just a matter of screws and pegs. It all fit together marvelously and I asked 2 nice construction worker from the next door remodel to come set it upright and put it against the wall. We are thrilled, it matches exactly the two 6x6 units we bought from IKEA for the end wall of the room 10+ years ago (we also had to have help in getting those units upright and in place).  THESE ARE HEAVY DUTY BOOK CASES!"
80275887,"Perfect side table. Made this into my organization station, with Printer on top. Love it. It's perfect in my new office space."
70301537,"Perfect for large books and storage. Very sturdy, cubes big enough for larger books. Like the flexibility of using some cubes for cabinets or drawers."
40275846,"Simple. Easy to asemble, used the Ikea drill kit and was built in less than an hour. Amazing for someone like me who is terrible with directions. It is tall and sturdy. No back but versitile. I like it."
00275848,"Very good!. I bought a single unit to go with double unit due to space limits. It was (surprisingly) slightly more complicated to assemble than bigger unit, but still easy enough. Very happy with it."
60275812,Very sturdy. I really love this KALLAX Shelf unit it works amazing in my daughters room to help keep down the clutter. It is really well made and looks really nice. Great value
80275887,"So good I have bought it twice. I love how easy they go together, so much space, and how nice the look. Keep up the great work."
20275814,"Kallax is just what I needed. As a seasoned scrapbooker, I finally found a way to store my 12x12 pads if scrapbook paper. I wish I had room for more Kaplan units."
60275812,"Great addition to craft room. Bought this to accompany it's 3 cube x 4 cube shelf unit sister. Product is good. Delivery was perfect. Installation was very easy. Two concerns (1) Screw heads are visible which severely limit the aesthetics, and (2) DO follow the instructions to a T. We tried to get ahead of ourselves (after just having installed the larger 3x4 unit), and started to place dowels in all of the connecting holes (just like the larger unit), until we ran out, and then discovered that this smaller unit doesn't use all drill holes. So we doubled back and pulled them out with some difficulty. If only we actually read the instructions for this little unit first."
50214678,"For the price, these are AMAZING!. I have been looking at metal and glass shelves for awhile, but wasn’t wanting to dish out a lot of money, due to the fact these are in my kids playroom. These look great, and the fact that all of the feet are adjustable, makes these even better! We live in a 68 year old home with the original hardwood floors, and they are uneven in places. I also highly enjoy the way these attach to the walls. It is more attractive than the typical anti-tip devices! I buying these for another room!"
50339292,Looks great. Easy to put together and looks great. Put two together to make a nice entertainment stand.
70301537,Perfect for growing record collection!. I have owned these for years. Happy to upgrade to the larger unit.
60275812,. I like this .It is very useful..
70301542,"Sturdy shelves!. Instructions are easy to follow, packaging was GREAT & ensured there was no damage, very sturdy shelves."
70342199,"Nice Shelving. I like the color a lot. The wood top is a nice touch. It wasn't as easy to put together as I would have liked, but that is more a testament to my handyman skills. If I had a better screwdriver, it would have gone much easiar. It looks really nice."
70339291,"Looks well in the room.. Glad I decided on the purchase, easy assembly, looks great and functions well in the room."
80275887,"Couldn't be happier. Item was fairly easy to put together, took about 20 minutes. Once it was all done, I couldn't be happier with the item. It fits perfectly in our playroom, and does the job of storing all of our 1 year old toys. Love!"
50339292,Great!. We use it as a TV stand and it’s perfect!
80275887,Exactly what I wanted. Easy to put together and they (2) fit perfectly in my closet.
20275885,good for eveything. Great for so many projects.
19278328,"Exactly what I needed for my sewing room. I bought this unit to help organize my sewing room supplies. It’s perfect! The quality is excellent. The drawers and closed cabinets handle an array of smaller items, while books and fabric are easily accommodated in the open cubes. The unit took less than an hour to assemble. It’s a great solution in a challenging space."
20275885,I love this. I glad I brought this i love how it looks in my front room i use this as a tv stand and to place  my picture and ect on the shelves
80275887,Very sturdy and attractive. Very nice unit. Looks great with a few wicker baskets and accents. Very sturdy. Not flimsy.
40346924,"Perfect for Books and Games. My eleven year old put it together ALMOST entirely on her own. All the game room mess fits in it perfectly, including board games that I thought would be too big. Love this as much or more as any IKEA purchase we've ever made."
50334591,How the heck do you assemble it?. I'd love the way it would look if I could get it together. I've never had problems assembling IKEA furniture in the past. This one has me stumped.
80275887,Versatile for Display and Organization. Nice clean look for organizing crafts and other supplies.
30275861,"Great craft storage. I bought this because the workstation was out of stock at the time, so I just put together my own with the same added pieces. I bought a few of the boxes and drawers and filled it up quickly with craft supplies!"
20275885,Really good quality took no time to put together. Bought this for my sons room
89278301,"Versatile. I have 3 of these one in high gloss white (kitchen) bought 2 doors and 2 drawer inserts, one black/brown (living room) bought the cube inserts, high gloss gray(office) no inserts as of yet. I may get one for each of the kids rooms for their books. Each one looks different and are used in different way. The kitchen and LR ones are upright and the office is long ways on its side. The price is even better."
80334603,"Eket. So easyJet to assembly, great quality, I'm very happy with my Eket"
79278250,"Great for organizing craft room. Good product. Easy to put together. Delivery was perfect. Only concern is screw heads ARE visible, so I'll need to come up with some way to cover them."
70342199,Aesthetic and sturdy. I bought this to go with my new BROR Utility Cart. Perfect match-up for my mini office.
60333954,"easy peasy. Easy to assemble. With the base, it becomes perfect size of storage unit for kid's room."
20213312,"Beautiful Piece of Furniture. 4 out of 5 stars only because the instructions weren't easy to follow but, once you figure it out it is easy to finish. I feel like the tiny screws for the solid wood shelving pieces are unnecessary if you plan on storing light objects on the shelves. Nice, sturdy, beautiful addition to any room though!"
10275862,Perfect Size. I am using this as a pantry for extra storage
20275885,. This was my second purchase of the Kallax shelf! And I definitely love it!
20305745,. The bookcase is really nice and works well. I just wish i looked at the box before taking it home. It was damaged on the top so we had to flip it over and now the nails show. ;o(
00334536,"Easy Assembly / Great for Vinyl or Other Shelving. Didn't take me long to put these together (I ordered two for giving myself room to expand my ever-growing vinyl collection). Very little tools needed for assembling, and it's great for why I need it. A little tricky getting everything to line up, but once you do, it just pretty much slides into place and is very sturdy."
10275862,Great product. It was the perfect height and size.
20213312,A great add-on to my home!. This shelf unit has become a great add on to my dining room. The assembly is pretty simple and it’s worth it for the price I paid. The only con is that it’s not as sturdy as I would want it to be.
10305741,"Great piece. Work perfect for our needs we love it Great finish and looks. Most say, like everything in IKEA IKEA is brilliant!"
20275885,. I love the piece I turned it on it side and it makes a perfect side table
20275885,A big hole on the side. Need quality control. Ordered this and paid $100+ for shipping. Opened the box (which had a gash) and there was a huge ding on the side. Too much of a hassle to schedule a return.
60275812,"Love this shelf unit!. What more do you need to know? It looks great, holds all kinds of items including VINYL RECORDS perfectly, comes in lots of colors and sizes, and works in pretty much every room of your home."
20409936,. I bought this month ago and I love it!
00334536,"It holds a Lot!. It's cute, and with the Eket boxes I bought to go with it, it holds all my yarn!!"
50481172,Good!. Good!
30275861,"Got clutter?. This wall is a roomsaver! With the drawer, shelf, door and basket options I was able to get rid of several mix n match cabinets and shelving units in my office/sewing/wrapping/filing room. You can organize better, actually find things quickly, and queue the need to declutter whenever a cube fills up. The 4x4 unit was perfect because I could still place decorative items and framed photos atop the unit to dress it up."
30275861,Formerly expedit. I love the bookshelf using as room divider! Was a little tougher to put together though than the expedits I have put together in the past. Required a lot of hammering while in the past you could just push in the dowels and have the bookshelf together in about 15 minutes. This time took about 2 hours! Also added the doors which added a lot to the classy look of the bookshelf. You have to be committed though to placement because of door box because of screws to attach the door!
60275812,"My fourth 4 square Kallax. I have these in four locations in our house. I incorporated one with an Ikea shelf and added baskets to make a great makeup/jewelry dressing area. A second is in our bathroom. 2 baskets hold extra soap, shampoo etc, in the two remaining open areas I keep one filled with loose toilet paper rolls and the other with rolled extra towels (also Ikea). A third holds supplies in my sewing room, and the fourth is a perfect coffee station in a sitting room off of my bedroom."
40303439,"Love!. Love these, use them in my busines!"
20275885,. I love these shelves. It works perfectly as a television stand.
80275887,"Was a great addition to my small room .. I set it on a wall, sort of dividing dining room from sitting room"
20275814,Great shelf!. I bought this and absolutely love it
30275861,Love these units!. My one entire wall of my sewing room is Kallax shelving. Works well for fabric and supplies and looks great.
10305802,"Great alternative for a TV stand!. We intended this for my small apartment as a TV stand and storage unit. We also purchased several other Vittsjo pieces (the coffee table and laptop table) and they look so clean and polished in my living room. This shelf unit is the perfect height for a TV, and we use the shelves for other electronic storage and such"
00275848,Works fine for kid's room. Very easy assembly and durable enough. The only thing missing is the discontinued wheel sets...bring these back!
40334558,X-small cabinet!. We are looking for the cabinet in a very small space between A/C and Window. This cabinet is a perfect to fit it!
40415601,Perfect size!. We absolutely love the 3x3 shelf. We have a couple 4x2's but were looking for something a little bigger to put in our kids playroom. This is it! It doesn't take up the whole wall and provides just enough storage for all the toys and movies!
20275814,. Awesome piece. Great value.
20275885,Perfect fit. The unit went together quickly and easily. We laid it on the long side in our mud room and put IKEA baskets in the top shelves for mittens and dog paraphernalia. It looks great and keeps the chaos under control.
50339292,Looks great in office. Bought 2 shelving units for husband’s office. Did not take long for the two of us to assemble. Looks great and is sturdy.
80275887,Very sturdy unit and looks great!. I bought this unit about 3 weeks ago. I use it to store the grandkids toys for when the come to visit. The individual spaces are a good size and the cube I bought to go with it are perfect! Really cleans up the space. Best Buy for the money.
80275887,Great value. I’m a (very) senior lady who recently bought 2 of these units. I had purchased 2 previously. I put them all together myself. Assembly is straightforward and the shelves look very nice. Good value for the price!
80275887,"Easy!. Easy to put together, nice looking and solid construction. Love it!"
90286649,What I need. What I need
50339292,"Attractive and functional. This is a pretty nice shelf, we stacked ours on top of a sideboard to function as an extra layer of storage. Sturdy and functional, the only issue is the doors didn't quite line up perfectly on the metal grate part. We noticed the same issue in the floor model but thought it may have just been poorly assembled. Not so, there's just not a way to get the doors perfectly aligned. Still fully functional even if the doors are slightly lopsided though!"
20275814,Stylish. Bought this about 2 weeks ago for my daughters room. Went to 5 below and bought little bins for it. She uses it for her books and store toys in the bins.
10275862,"BEST IKEA PURCHASE!d. We love these shelves! Perfect for a room divider that allows for versatility and light to flow through. Although assembly took longer than we thought it would, it was worth it, as it is incredibly sturdy."
20275814,"Order, please!. Great price and when you have space to place things, your house is in order! A little tricky to assemble."
00334536,Defective product. I returned the product twice after I couldn't assemble it. There was no support for help. The only option is to return and pick up another piece.
30275861,"Kallax rocks!. I absolutely love this bookshelf! I am redoing our dining room (which we never use) into more of a reading/sitting room since I have so many books. This shelf is perfect for the space. It holds more than I realized! It was not difficult to put together, though it is a bit heavy."
10275862,"Perfect size.. Bought this for my roommate to use as a room divider for our den/mudroom, it works perfectly! Not too tall or bulky."
20275814,"A perfect storage staple. I bought this unit a few months ago in the turquoise-gray-green color. It came flat packed as expected and wrapped in a protective blue film. The unit was very easy to assemble. A little trick with assembly, if you are leaning this item up against the wall, keep the wall side wrapped in film. That way if you damage the front, you can flip it around and not have any scratches."
80275887,"goldilocks review. If there were a version that was 44 tall and contained 6 sections, I would give Kallax 5 stars."
80275887,"Love yhis. We love this shelf and now have two in our little home, a white one and a black one. We've used them horizontal and vertically and currently have them both horizontally. One in our office with printer on top & storage baskets underneath and the other in our boys' room being used as a bookshelf. Love them!"
00415599,Looks great!. Works well for a TV stand and additional storage.
50339292,Terrible product. We bought this at the store today and just put it together. The very last step is attaching the doors. The pre-drilled holes for the hinges on the left side are in completely different spots than the ones on the right. This causes the doors to not line up and look ridiculous.
20275885,"Great for any space. Solid design and function. We own 4 Kallax units, two are used as bookshelves, the others as dressers with the 12 bins."
20275885,Easy to assemble. I was able to assemble this unit in 40 minutes. The instructions are clear on what needs to happen.
60275812,". I haven't put it together yet, but I know that I'm going to love it! I have two of the the eight cubed shelves!"
50339292,. Magnet is weak and door swings open alot
20275885,Very sturdy. Easy to assemble Just what I was looking for
10275862,"Epic room divider. Kallax 4x4 Unit is an amazing, easy, and sturdy peice of divine furnature goodness. Its as strong as Thor, quick to put together as a puzzle, and easy on the eyes. Kallax 4x4 is customaizable and adding a splash of color to the room is easy with colored kallax boxes."
60278170,I love this so much. This is the best if you want to add some swag and storage to your kallax. The only thing is that the install is a little technical. I struggled a little to onset the screws. But overall look is awesome.
60275812,"Love love love these shelves!. Very sturdy, multiple uses. We use these as bookshelves, storage drawers, and just exchanged my son's dresser out for these with drawers. So much easier for a little guy to manage."
20275885,Perfect. Perfect
10275862,Simply amazing. When I saw this in the showroom I know my living room would be completed with it. I got it with the draws and door that was advertised in the cubbies. It was very easy to install and the wood seems of great quality. A must have! I get lots of compliments from guest who come over.
20213312,Very good. Easy to set up and very functional and attractive.
00415599,". Love them both, will purchase more"
40346924,". The KALLAX Shelf is great, very flexible in its usage, as well as adding a decorative point in the room."
20275885,Gorgeous! Heavy and looks very expensive!!. Super quality and very lush color! Easy to assemble and looks amazing horizontal.... Will definitely buy additional ones for family room!
00275848,Easy to Assemble. This is sturdy and very easy to assemble.
50339292,Great looks for a little money. When I saw this piece at the store it was exactly was I was looking for my office. We turned it into a small bar. It was super easy to put together and it looks great!
20275885,ease of construction. good 'construction' experience- bonded with teen-aged son :)
30275861,. Both this 3 months ago. Perfect
70342199,Awesome bookshelf. Bought for my daughter at college. She loved the modern design. I loved how easy it was to put together. Great size to use in apartment in many locations. Sturdy. Price was great for Mom and Dad too.
20275885,"Taking Back Your Space!. In love! I originally went to buy one unit and after the first I went back for more! My home has never felt more organized and chic at the same time. With different sizes the functionality is endless. From shoes, games, arts&crafts, to home entertainment decor it’s amazing to take back your space and feel like you live in a brand new home!"
40346924,Good product that I have purchased before. I like this product line although I am disappointed that you discontinued the finish (light birch finish) product which has caused me to change finish color to one I am not thrilled with.
20275885,Very sturdy and looks great!!!. I love this so much I bought 2!
20409936,LOVE KALLAX!. This is the 7th Kallax unit I have purchased because I absolutely love them!! Its high quality and not expensive!
20275885,"Excellent quality. I love the Kallax. I have five of them throughout my house. The quality and sturdiness can’t be beat by any other brand. These are versatile, functional and the perfect addition to any room."
60275812,Like the shelves. They worked perfectly with my needs. Will get two more if at same price.
29278262,Kallax Shelving. Bought this about a month ago. Went together very easy. All the parts were there. Instructions easy to understand. Very solid unit. I would highly recommend if you are in the market for shelving.
80275887,Sturdy!. I have 3 of these to help with closet clutter. Love them!  I've used two more horizontally in my sewing room connected with a large piece of plywood for a cutting table. They are fairly easy to construct thoughh it does take two people. They are pretty and simple.
60275812,"Good for the Price. This was a bit difficult to hang on the wall and does look a bit cheap. But, for the price, it has done it's job of holding tchotchkes and such. I would probably pay a little bit extra for the colored ones next time."
60275812,Nice bookcase. Perfect bookshelf for my grandkids
20275885,"sturdy and attractive. I have two of these, one set up horizontally under the bedroom windows and another in the main book area of the house, set up vertically. In both orientations this thing serves well to hold heavy books. The dividers strengthen it, and break up the long stretches of book spines. Easy enough to put together, too."
60221683,"screw holes strip easily. This metal unit looks great and is a great size, but for $130 it should have a better way to enjoy the unit can be put together properly (and Ideally taken about without being ruined). But there is nothing to protect the screw holes, so if the screw goes in a little bit the wrong way most likely you'll strip the metal where the screw goes and it's ruined. It happened to us so we returned it. There's better options at IKEA."
20275885,Sturdy cubicle shelf. I have 6 of these in my house now. They are very solid and practical with extra large buckets
20275885,"Great addition to my home.. Bought this unit for space saver in baby room. Excellent addition for a place to display antique and modern keepsakes. As well as it being a great look. It looked so great, I got another one for a second room."
10305741,HIGHLY RECOMMEND. AWESOME HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
50334591,Impossible to assemble. Big mistake to buy. Too hard to assemble. Returned to store.
20275885,This the best thing for my little girl cube. Hold a lot of cubes my little girl love this
20275814,Quick and attractive solution for. Quick and attractive solution for organizing the home office
29278304,Love this. Moved into a new house. Needed some place for grandkids to put their shoes etc. works perfectly. Easy to put together and looks great!
70301537,. Cabinet is beautiful and very sturdy. Also spacious. Cubbies are a lot bigger than they appear in photos. Tons of storage. I have doors on a couple and put drawers in others some are just open. Looks great.
20275885,"Looks nice. I bought this a little over a month ago, it was pretty easy to put together but I wish I had more instructions on how to hammer to prevent parts of the wood from becoming damage."
40415601,Perfect size.. Easy to assemble. Perfect for dorm room.
70301542,. I bought this for my son to organize his apartment. Very pleased with it!
39278290,"Shelf Unit. drawers fit easily into unit, easy to assemble"
10305741,Love it!. I love the Kallax shelf unit - especially with the shiny surface as it looks great and is easy to clean.
80401292,"Exactly what I wanted!. This was the perfect modification for my kallax. Easy to assemble, slides in and out easily, perfect fit for my wine bottles, and added an upscale look to my shelves."
20213312,"Open, airy display. I needed display for my nicknacks and frames & storage for my many books. It adds great storage, without adding bulk. It looks expensive, but was so affordable!"
20409936,"Versatile Product. I bought this for extra storage in my office. This is a great piece for customizing, which I added drawers, doors, and bins to. It looks great and is functional too. I would highly recommend this product."
60275812,Love it. Perfect size for kids books and easy to assemble.
70342199,Does the trick!. Storage is at a premium in our house so we needed something that could hold a microwave and baking items. This holds everything we need and does it fashionably. Very easy to put together. I suggest bolting to the wall.
80275887,"Great shelf, but not built the way they used to be. Let me start off by saying that when we picked up this shelf at the store, it was well packaged, not damaged, easy to put together and is exactly as pictured with the white one we chose and the cube spaces fit 13x13 organizers perfect. We have always been happy with Ikea products, but found this experience to be a bit disheartening due to quality/durability. We have an identical Kallax shelf that is 7 years old in the black-brown color and the quality (very durable), weight (very solid) and size are DEFINITELY different from the new. At the time we paid $79.99.    With the new one,(we paid $68.99) we noticed the thick edges are almost an inch less on each side compared to the one we have and with that it also makes it about an inch shorter. We thought the cost difference was Ikea's lowering of their prices to a Member's type price like they do on certain products but everything about it remains the same. In this case, the quality changed, but appearance remained.   Had I never owned a Kallax shelf, I would not have noticed this, but we do in this situation. I think this is a great piece for a low traffic area, but with the current materials they used, I wouldn't highly recommend it with high traffic use. The material also doesn't seem as durable, but only time will tell. With the material they used and building it using less overall materials, it also comes with a lesser weight and it just doesn't seem as solid. Although the new one looks great, the overall quality has changed.     This experience hasn't at all deterred us from wanting to go back to Ikea again because we love the store. But, I know that had I known the quality and weight would be so different, I may have looked elsewhere. I hope this helps someone! :)"
10275862,. I bought this a couple months ago and I love it. Lots of storage space and got bins to go with it.
80303437,"Perfect scale. Great retail shelf, assembly was ok and clean look-"
10305741,"Wood pegs don't fit holes. I was expecting these to be more sturdy looking at the pictures. It turns out almost the entire thing is held together with round wooden pegs! Worst of all, those pegs don't fit the holes they are made for properly. Trying to push the shelves onto the wooden pegs doesn't work and if you use a tool to try and get the shelf in further the cheap fake wood dents and the veneer cracks. I recommend you spend your money on a higher quality piece of furniture..."
00275848,"Sturdy & Useful. I bought this after looking extensively for affordable options to shelve my album collection. This Kallax shelf is the perfect combination of sturdy, sizeable, affordable and visually quiet."
80334603,"Ridiculously Hard to Assemble. I bought 3 of these cubes for my daughter's room. The first one was difficult to assemble, but we were able to assemble. The other two will probably be going back to the store. Just as other reviewers have stated, we got 3 of the sides on but the fourth side will not click on. Something doesn't fit together correctly. And, if my husband had not have used all of his arm strength none of the sides would have gone on. Do not waste your money on these cubes. Pieces of junk, made poorly, and impossible to assemble."
40275846,Perfect size. Works great as a bench under window. Easy assembly.
90286649,Very happy with it.. It was easy to assemble and fulfilled a need in organizing my things.
50214678,good look. They have a classy look at a good price
10275862,Lots of storage!. I bought the bigger one awhile ago and loved it so I went back and bought its little brother. I am very satisfied with both products.
20275814,Sturdy!. I've bought and put together 3 of these with one more to go. They go together pretty easily. I have had some difficulty getting the top and bottom screws all the in but I think I've solved that by screwing the screws in before trying to attach the parts - seems to help with the holes going deeper.
00314642,"Easy install, great style!. Got this to create a space-saving multi-purpose work area in a small bedroom - that also needs to host a visitor or grandchild at times! These drawers can be placed anywhere within the Kallax storage system, so we could put them up high beyond the reach of the little one but within grasp for me to get at needles and threads. Very useful, for so many things, in so many ways! Assembly was quick, drawers pull out smoothly."
20275814,Heavy duty.. Bought a couple weeks ago and have found it very useful.
00275848,"Good size. Perfect for my mini bolts of fabric in my sewing studio. Easy to put together, too."
30275861,"KALLAX: Great for Crafts. Excited to rebuild my craft space after a recent flood, and the KALLAX unit is perfect."
20275885,Easy to assemble!. Works great for my needs.
70332124,"Difficult assembly. Such a simple design. Should be a quick 5 minute assembly but it’s not. Parts do not slide together. Be prepared to get out your mallet. Also, wall mounting hardware is not included. Be prepared to figure that out on your own andmake a trip to the hardware store."
40275846,"Wish it had a back.. Everything is fine and went together easily. Unfortunately, it did not have a back. When I saw it put together in the store, it had a back on it. I assumed if it was on display in the store with a back, it would have one in the box."
70339291,"Beautiful Shelving Unit. This is a beautiful shelving unit that we bought for our extra kitchen storage. This unit is very sturdy, beautiful, and perfect for us. The only issue is that it took a very long time to put together."
80275887,Perfect for what I needed. Exactly what I was looking for and fits the spot I intended for it
99017445,Nice. Love it
00334536,Easy Assembly!. This sturdy little unit is the easiest Ikea piece I've ever assembled. Virtually no tools (just a hammer to softly set the final piece into place). Very attractive and useful.
30275861,"Right size, right format. Needed a better way to organize all the millions of toys and books in the kids' room. This fit perfectly within their closet after I removed the doors. Now their room feels more open and bright. We bought a handful of different colored bins, some transparent, some opaque. It feels well designed. Assembly is a piece of cake. The unit is extremely heavy, but it cannot fall on the kids even if they tried to climb it because the front walls of the closet are situated just right to catch it."
70301537,". Excellent as a bookshelf, I have to buy another one."
10345073,Adorable. I bought this to add to my tv stand on the bottom to add extra storage since it's gold it looks great with the white stand
60275812,"Works Perfect!. I got t his foe under my wall mounted tv to put misc DVD , Roku things on. Very unobtrusive."
79278325,". Good design, very sturdy and well-engineered. Attractive and fits well in my smallish apartment. Glad I found it online and had my two sons available to assemble it."
70301537,5 x 5 cube storage. 5 x 5 cube storage
10275862,Great unit as expected. I had to drill the holes for the wood dowels a little deeper in order for the pieces to sit together flush. Otherwise the fit was perfect and it went together easily
20275885,Sturdy. Easy to put together. Fits a lot of books. This is our second one since purchasing a white one a few weeks ago.
80275887,Useful shelving!. We've bought 3 of these and find them very useful and attractive
70286645,Looks and works great. I had not looked at these in the store but took the chance. Love them. Easy to install and holds more than you would think for the size.
90286649,Great add to stand. Love the look makes stand look more finished
60278170,Great color features. Makes cube more functional
10409932,"The best cube shelf!. Do t buy any other cube shelf! We bought one from fred Meyer, and it was flimsy. One from target and it wasn’t a good size. Ikeas is super sturdy, super clean and the perfect size for actual storing things in the cubes! Finding the cubes for 2.99 was a HUGE plus, also!!"
20275885,Good Shelves for the price. This was easy to assemble but it helps to have help. A sturdy piece for the price.
70301537,"Great temporary storage unit. This KALLAX unit is the fourth one we have purchased. The first was for a television and storage, the next two units were for grandchildren and the last KALLAX unit is being used to temporarily store street shoes and bags during ballroom dance lessons and dances."
20275885,Very practical. easy to assemble and very decorative
10305802,. Bought this shelving unit about a month ago and it was easy to assemble and it looks great.
00314642,How cool is this?!?!?!. We love the insert with 2 drawers. It fits well into my husband's Kallax shelf unit and provides two great places to store small items. We love it!
60275812,Happy. Happy with my new purchase
20275814,"Versatile storage!!. I've purchased several of these, I love hanging them on the wall, diagonally from each other so the top of one unit becomes an easy place to place things as well. Having flexibility to use doors, drawers, or totes has made this a staple for storage in bedrooms, the basement, and even our living room."
20305745,"Meets our needs!. This unit is perfect for our home office. The size works great and we added the doors, drawers, and bins to really customize the unit to our needs."
30275861,Very sturdy. This is a fantastic shelving unit. I use it for my kids toys along with the Drono boxes. It is very sturdy for the size. I love the 13 cube size. I fit all the kids toys and have room to spare. For the size of the unit the price is great. Much lower than if I were to try to get something comparable at another store.
20275814,Great for LP and stereo components. Perfect for record collection
70301542,Useful as an alternative to a dresser. I bought this along with the DRONA boxes and use it in place of a dresser. The 25 individual boxes allow me to be super organized. It looks great. We bought black with the black boxes and are very happy with it.
40275846,Best shelf ever. Perfect for my space. Easy to build
80275887,"Finally organized my bedroom:). I love these cubes. I turned them on their side and put them up against a far wall that was being underutilized. They are deep enough to hold my record player, so beautiful flowers and plants, and the pull out bins that coordinate with the cube make a perfect laundry basket. I have more delicate items protected inside the lower cubes where they look beautiful. I am very glad I made this purchase. I bought more than one size to fill the entire wall, and the fact that they are backless lets me utilize the electric outlets behind them. They are terrific."
80275887,"Love it. Love it , so easy to build and super cute"
20275814,. I bought two about 2 weeks ago and I love it. It is easy to ensamble.
00275848,"Love This Shelf!!!!. I had an idea for my laundry room and looked around at different places to find a shelf that would serve the purpose I needed for my this. After looking in several stores, I found the Kallax Shelf and decided to go with it. It was perfect for what I needed. I turned it on it's side over my washer and dryer added little baskets to store stuff it and it gave this room a whole new look and gave me a little extra storage space. Love it!!!"
50339292,Found It!. This is my dream storage superstar for my sewing room! This sturdy piece holds more items than a full size dresser. I may buy another.
00334536,Great display for my treasures!!!. I love this cabinet. I’m going back to buy two more!!
70301537,"Just right. Gives me lots of storage for my small office. It was so easy to put together, I did it myself (senior female). It looks great!"
60275812,Does just what I need. I wanted a small storage unit for my computer room at home and this unit filled the bill. Just the right size.
70301537,Lots space. I bought this for my craft room has lots of space for all my supplies
20278167,Clutter-gone. I bought these a month ago and I’m so happy that I did that because now I have doors to cover up all of my clutter. It has taken a simple busy area in my room and turned it into an elegant little corner.
20213312,Looks great!. Very happy with this unit. It looks classy.
10305802,". Love how this shelf looks! I love the glass shelf and thin, metal legs. It makes it look very sleek."
40314640,"Love it. Could not locate item.. ran into it on display.. asked for help.. was given a black on after asking for a white one.. employee would not walk back to get correct one.. so I had to get item number and locate myself. Display price was wrg, states it was 17.99.. it was 25$ out of frustration and confusion I just bought one. Luckily I loved it easy installation.. would love to get 4 more for my kallax but too expensive.. great piece tho."
20305745,Great feature!. My kids have a small room they both share. Toys were everywhere until now. It adds an architectural element too.
70301542,". Bought this shelf about a month ago and it has been great! Easy to assemble and lots of room for books and home office papers, etc. I was a little concerned after reading some reviews but went ahead with it since we own several smaller units as well. Glad we did!"
10345073,Great product.. This item is great for making a bar to hold glasses. It works very well.
20275814,"Sturdy, affordable. We bought two of these for two different uses, and are very pleased with both. We needed a higher-than-normal TV stand for the bedroom and kitchen storage. One unit has two of the double-drawer inserts. Very easy assembly, very sturdy results."
40415192,awsome. Great color just what we needed
00275848,Clean & simple. I used this vertically in my bathroom with the BRANÄS baskets and it looks great. Bathroom always looks neat & tidy because everything is hidden in baskets instead of strewn all over shelves.
90305803,Love it. I bought this a few weeks ago. Very happy
70301537,". I have three young kids and needed storage for our family room. I bought this to replace a medium size bookcase and a credenza. Now we have TONS of storage. I bought the drawer inserts and 5 kallax canvas cubes for the bottom row. All of the babies toys and six year old toys go in the cubes and are hidden and look clean when the drawers a shut. I also bought the drawer inserts. They’re awesome! We now have 10 drawers and no longer have clutter aka school papers and bills etc on the kitchen counters. I use one drawer for diapers/wipes, two for kids art supplies, one for stamps/ bills/ office supplies.. the list goes on. This piece is simply awesome and we get a ton of compliments."
40275846,Looks great. Live this for extra storage! Live it with the doors put on! Looks like finish furniture!
20275814,". Really good, easy to put together"
20213312,"Looks Great. Great price and looks great, and was easy to assemble."
20275814,"Great for bedroom organization!. I love these cubes. I put them up against a far wall that was being underutilized. They are deep enough to hold my record player, some beautiful flowers and plants, and the pull out bins that coordinate with the cube make a perfect laundry basket. I have more delicate items protected inside the lower cubes where they look beautiful. I am very glad I made this purchase."
00415599,Perfect for storage.. Perfect for storage.
80401292,"Adds Instant Style. I have no idea how I will ultimately use this insert as I put together a multi-purpose work area but they are soooo cool to look at within the system and super easy to install. We may add more because I can't decide which craft items to put into these slots plus, we can put one down low for the grandchild to store toys and/or socks!"
20275814,KALLAX. It looks great up on my wall!!! Happy I can now hide my cable wires!!!!!
10345073,"nice. A bit expensive (10$) for wire basket I thought, but I paired it w hemnes console table and I must say the gold tone w the stark white stain furniture brings a gorgeous warmth to the room. It is very classy"
70332124,"50% chance of breaking immediately. I bought 4 of these this week, and 2 broke extremely easily while putting them together. I went back to get replacements today, and one of the new ones broke in the exact same place as the others. Also, the aisle with them was blocked off and I'm pretty sure the worker at ikea got me the wrong color, which I can live with but is just kind of annoying."
10409932,love the storage. i have 2 of these and they are easy to put together. they have lots of storage.
60278170,"Requires drilling 6 screws into hard wood dividers. They look fine, but installing them in any position that isn't against one of the hollow-core sides is a huge pain. Requires you to drill straight into the hard wood interior dividers without any guides. Power drill helps - but you'd better get it right the first time and not want to change things up in the future."
60275812,"Flexible storage!!. We own several of these storage units, including 4x4, 2x4, and 2x2 units. All were simple to assemble, sturdy, and consistent in quality. These cases serve us as file cabinets, television stands, and decorative pieces displays.We always know what we're getting when we purchase another, and that means a lot!!"
80275887,"Love!. This is my second time purchasing! I love it in the kids room, extra storage space for toys, books etc."
10345073,. I love this wire basket - I have it hanging in the Kallax Shelf Unit and it is holding all of my cords so that they are out of the way!
30275861,". item looks great and works well. however, definitely takes two people to put together. sooooooo heavy. injured my back just trying to lift the boxes onto my cart in the store."
80275887,Perfect storage shelves. Bought 2 of these a month ago for my kids playroom and they love it they keep everything organized when playtime is over it's so much easier to make kids enjoy cleaning up
10345073,Great feature!. You can hook the back to hold it in place so it is not just hanging like others I’ve used. This is very sturdy!
20275885,Great for kid clutter!. I bought this unit and some cute baskets to go in the cubes to help us control the kid clutter in our living room. I have it set on it’s side so it’s low for the kids to reach. It works great!
20275885,. Love this! Use as a tv stand but stylish with all the extra storage room
20409936,"Great Shoe Organizer!. If your teenager collects high end shoes they will love this item. My son was so glad the unit stored the shoes with the boxes. Great price, clean design."
20213312,". Relatively easy to build, and without the glass its really easy to move with one person. Happy with it in my small space because the open back and glass shelves makes my space feel bigger."
90286649,super item. went together with ease as expected great quality
20213312,Elegant. Elegant glass shelving unit. Very stable and sturdy. Live displaying pictures and decorations.
20275814,"I made a bar out of it: it's sturdy, easy to clean. I would highly recommend this shelf! I like this one so much, for the unusual purpose I use it, I am getting several more Kallax. We are going to make more room in our humble abode by going more vertical with shelving. We are going to buy several larger, taller shelves, of varying sizes, for different spots in the house. I know they will hold up! Several years ago, I was shopping alone at an Ikea. I had driven, for a different reason, a few hours from home to a city that had a store; I decided to spend my evening at Ikea (the meatballs called me). We had been considering adding a small counter near the dining table, in our kitchen-dining area. Brainstorming about what we might need for the house, I recalled the counter idea. I looked at several items, but I thought this Kallax shelf (in white) could be the right fit as a modest bar counter with storage. It worked out just as I had hoped! I placed this along the wall of our kitchen-dining area, under a window, opposite all of the kitchen counters. It fit below the window sill perfectly. Since I don't keep much liquor around, there would be room to store other things. So, to store whatever we wanted, without having to look at it, I included a few seagrass baskets (the Knipsa). While it's a nontraditional use, as a simple bar, this shelf has worked out very well! We have had it for about three years now. It is very easy to clean, and at 13 inches and change, each shelf is large enough to hold every alcohol bottle we've had, except some artful, tall wine bottles. The shelves are very sturdy, and the top is fine for preparing a drink, keeping mixing sticks and shot glasses, drinking glasses, and a bit of decor. It's almost the height of most tables, so it works out really well as a counter, instead of a mere shelf."
40346924,"grat value, strong built. Nice product, strong built and nice finish in Grey color (my choice)"
80275887,"Great Shelving For Organizing Just About Anything!. We love these Kallax unit shelves very much and have them in different areas in our house serving different functions. The main one we use the most is a set up of a 2x4 side by side with a 4x4 with a 1x4 across the top of those, and we use them to store our boardgames. The white looks really sharp and makes the board game covers pop. We also have a 2x4 in my daughter's play area and two additional 2x4's in a large storage closet to help keep everything orgainzed. The cubbies are the perfect size in my opinion."
30275861,"Sturdy and Spacious!. This shelving unit is amazing. It's very sturdy, and the cubes are really large, so you can fit a TON of stuff into it. We also bought the DJÖRNA inserts, and managed to clear up an amazing amount of clutter. I love this as an organization piece!"
40275846,"Looks great but.... Looks great when done, but found out when I was done building it and going to put in a door that one of the sides was on backwards. Can't tell otherwise. However that meant removing the felt pad stickers. The glue on them is so strong that when trying to remove them it peels off the black surface material so once on you can't decide later you want the unit horizontal instead of vertical because you can't take off the pads."
70342199,Nice Sturdy. Liking the Industrial look shelving...
10409932,Craft Storage. This was the third unit I have purchased! I store all my cardstock in it. I finally feel so organized. Although it was heavy for me to maneuver by myself I did get the job done. They are easy to put together and very sturdy. If I had more room I would purchase another one.
10345073,. Love this! Makes the in house office not so “Office-y”
20275814,Great Design. I bought several of these last year in other colors and used them in different ways. Great design that adapts itself well to wherever you choose to put them.
99017186,I absolutely love my kallax. It sturdy and goes perfectly with my aesthetic.
40346924,LOVE this !!. Bought two of these last month as horizontal additional storage for our walk in closet. We both like them. Perfect for our needs and have no hesitation in recommending them. Easy to put together too !!
20275814,Love this product!. I have many Kallax products of various sizes and I absolutely love them all! They’re very useful and versatile as well as sturdy and a beautiful addition to my home! I would highly recommend these!
30275861,Love these shelves. We have several of these in our lower level. They are perfect for storing almost anything.
40334558,Cubes. Love our cubes. We used them for extra storage in our loft. Love them...
60275812,"Waste of money, no matter how small the price. Dowels actually break through the shelves during installation. Insides are so cheap that the wood scraps were rattling around on the inside when brand new. I have had numerous sizes in the past, but I think the quality is worse than before. You will be lucky if this unit even survives the building process Money down the drain.."
20275885,"Great features!. I have 2 of these! A white one in the playroom with cloth baskets on bottom and I keep books and toys in the top shelves. We have a dark brown with baskets in the bottom for gloves, hats, etc. and board games in the top that we have in the living area! These are awesome!"
70286645,Great feature. These are roomier then I thought they would be. They look nice in the cube cabinet.
90286649,Great in middle of Kalex. We put one in the middle of our Kalex and it worked and looks really good.
50305739,"Functional. We bought this unit (and 3 inserts) 5 months ago. Took brain effort to put it together, but that’s good for us, right? Love the size and the look! Just what we needed for visable storage near the back door"
10305802,Light and Airy. I have large windows but need the space in front of them for storage. The shelf was just right for allowing light to pass thru without the bulk.
29278304,"Great unit to use for a variety of needs.. I have had my shelf unit for about a month and it fits my needs very well. Easy to put together and has lots of options. I have drawers, doors and baskets that all work well for the light storage I need in my den."
50339292,"Just LOVE it!. Let me be frank. I hate IKEA. But I love this furniture line. I fell in love with it in the store and the love only grew once I got it in my house. The pieces go together well, it has all the pieces I need, seems sturdy, and is priced very appropriately. Time will tell how the wood holds up, if it warps, cracks, etc. But for now, I couldn't be happier. Note to IKEA: you should either pre-drill the holes in the wood, or supply a punch tool. This is the only part that is VERY iffy in the assembly process, and the wood did split (underside only, for now) on one of the shelves. Should not need to be afraid that one screw could ruin the whole piece."
80275887,Excellant. Met my needs and fit perfect in the space I planned
20275885,"Meets our needs perfectly!. I love love love this even more than I thought I would. We use it to store toys but it looks so lovely and keeps everything organized. The cubbies are nice and large and with the baskets we purchased, we can fit many things in each. Quality seems pretty good too."
89275091,"Very sturdy!. The bookshelf looks great and my beloved husband put it together rather quickly! If my unhandy husband can put it together, you can too!"
20275885,"Sturdy and functional. I have Kallax shelving units in multiple areas in my house. I have 2 that I utilize as file cabinets in my office and added drawers for pens and other incidentals. I also have some in my dining area that have bins for snacks, and another in the guest room for storage."
30275861,"Very functional. Great shelves. Solid and so many uses. Love how big each cubicle is. This is not a pueny piece of shelving like many that you buy at big box stores are. The 4x4 unit is a substantial size, but worth it if you have the room for it."
50214678,Can't live without my Vittsjo. I recently bought the unit to add to my other two from years ago. I love the open and airy feeling it gives the room. I bought the black to give an oriental flavor to the room.
60275812,Amazing!. We were looking for new nightstands to match our new bed frame. They are all so tiny and expensive. I love the Kallax shelf unit and figured why can't we use this as a night stand also. We have 5 Kallax shelf units in our home.
80303437,"sturdy. Sturdy,stable,ajustable bottom feet to level shelves"
20275885,"great product. Over the last two years, I have bought 3 of them. They are well built, durable and aesthetic. They are great as book shelves. I am very happy with the purchase."
60275812,Great feature. Bought this a month ago and it’s exactly what I needed .
20275814,Useful. Useful
20278167,Neater appearance. I was using the plastic crates. This insert makes the bookshelf look neater in appearance.
40275846,"Poorly constructed but good, cheap option.. An inferior version of the excellent Besta shelf. East to assemble. Looks good. Poor co strutted."
20275885,"Great quality.. I brought this for my girls room and love it. I use it for books, games & toys."
00275848,"Works good!. Yes, I love this shelf. Fits perfect for where i want it!"
20275885,Easy to assemble!. I bought this a couple of weeks ago and it looks great in my room.
80275887,"Pinterest worthy. Love the Kallax it’s always been a great product, it’s so versatile and affordable."
60333954,assembly issues. the hole for the middle vertical shelves would not match up.
10275862,"Used to be a good product. I bought one of these five years ago and it has been sturdy and functional. I just purchased another one and sadly they have taken a good product and made it bad. All the pieces are much thinner and now it is a wobbly mess. Good luck using it as a stand alone room divider. Also, it is now impossible to assemble the last two screws as the pieces don't go together properly."
60278170,Easy to install. The insert elevates the Kallax shelves to the next level.
20275885,Exactly what I was looking for.. The shelf unit was very easy to assemble and is very sturdy.
20275814,I like it. I love the shelf! Very durable .
20275885,Love it!. I didn’t know how much this was missing in my life! Easy to assemble. Very sturdy! Looks great!
10305741,LOVE this unit. I have many different configurations of this unit and I always go back for more. They are sturdy and versatile. I use this in my craft room which is perfect for all of my storage needs. I also use it in my kids rooms. It keeps everything organized.
20409936,Foyer perfection. We put this in our foyer to clean up the area. It works really well and now everything is much less cluttered.
20275814,Great for the price!. Great for extra storage and easy to assemble. I think it's pretty sturdy!
50305739,"Great value on a classic. Tough, sharp and versatile the kallax delivers. I had the 4x1 I have with legs and drawers as an end of bed bench and a 2x2 with doors as a kids dresser."
60278170,Great idea. Great idea to sell these because you can put a couple of these with the basket and it looks amazing!
20275885,"Wonderful storage!. These shelf units were the perfect storage solution for the small bedroom we were converting to an office/crafting center. The Drona boxes we'd purchased earlier fit perfectly in the cubicles and concealed crafting and sewing supplies from view. The FLYT and FLUNS boxes organized and stored magazines, printing paper, notebooks etc. while maintaining a neat and tidy appearance. We are well satisfied with the sturdy quality of the shelves, the abundance of storage, and the attractive appearance of our new multi-purpose office/work room."
20409936,Love the setup. Just what I needed to display my Mary Kay product.
20275814,Love em. Put these in my craft room starting out with 2. I now have 7 of them. Perfect. If I had more room i'd buy more.
00415599,"Great size, well built. Bought this for some office storage and I love it. I have a 5x5 as well and it has been great."
30275861,"easy to put together, sturdy. Because of the size of it I thought it might be complicated to put together but I surprised myself. It was up and anchored to the wall in less than 1 hour."
70301542,Good quality. These are great cubbies. I would recommend it.
50339292,"Looks great. We bought this to use as our bar, and it looks great in our dining room. It gives us a lot more space and the cabinet at the bottom means our bottles don't need to be on display. However, the bottom shelf is composed of the metal grate which could be sturdier. We may have to add a wooden plank to the inside."
70301537,So versitile. Love this! It looks amazing in our guest room/office. The room isn’t that big so I was a little worried if it would overtake the room but nope. I love that you can put other things in the cubicles other than books
80275887,Perfect Addition. We tried to install a PAX wardrobe but unfortunately didn’t fit in our small space. We chose two Kallax shelving units which fit perfectly and look amazing! Would highly recommend for price and appearance!
70301542,"Great features. I bought this shelf unit , im so happy"
80303437,"Lovely in my bedroom & living room. Great product! It was easy to put together. I purchased two of them and they are standing well. Only thing, if you don't want them to lean, there are holes on it that you may drill it through your wall to keep it stable. I pay do that."
80275887,Very versatile. I bought this to put in my closet and it works perfectly for extra storage
20275885,Classic.. 4th time buying. Love it!!
60333954,"Piece of Cake. I went in thinking assembly was going to be a nightmare, a lot of folks seem to express that in the reviews! But it was hyper easy. I think maybe they fumble with the + section in the middle. But as long as you start with the panel marked 1, you can't go wrong. Sturdy. Looks like a built-in. I used a drop of wood glue for each of the dowels to make it extra solid."
30275861,"Sturdy!. I got this recently for extra storage. It fits perfectly in the room, and it was easy to put together and is very stable!"
30275861,"Perfect for organizing and as a TV stand.. We bought this shelf over a year ago. It's durability is exactly as we expected from Ikea's products. We also purchased the boxes to organize (aka hide toys). It's laying horizontally, with out TV light and salt lamp on top. Would definitely recommend to a friend."
80275887,LOVE!. This is such a versatile and inexpensive piece of furniture. Perfect for use in any room and easy to assemble.
20275885,great organizer/bookshelf. We bought this for our living room to replace a taller/bigger bookshelf. This works well for our needs. It holds my scrapbooks well as well as other books and stuff we have.
20275885,"Love these shelves. I have 11 Kallax systems in the house of various sizes, and 5 at work. Love them overall. The older ones seem stronger, but for the price you can't beat them. They may not last forever (1 star off) but I will always recommend them to people."
20275814,"Fine but..... If you are hoping to use it in combination with an older Kallax style piece, don’t. The size and coloration are different. New one is slightly smaller and more white. I had two older ones (which I preferred to the new one that looked cheaper) so I returned and found older ones on Craigslist."
70301542,"Great for clothes storage. By using this instead of drawers, I found and can easily access all of my clothes.....everything is visible at a glance. I have a lot of clothes, but always wore the same thing because it was on top in the drawer or top shelf of my closet....now I can see everything, its organized by color and style and I can pick an outfit at an easy glance."
90286649,"Drawers. Love that there are drawers that can be added, rather than just a box. Best add on."
20275885,GREAT FURNITURE!. Bought this to organize my room and it was easy to build.
20275885,Excellent after the mishap!!. I bought this shelf to actually put my tv on and have storage space underneath. The only problem I had was putting the shelf together...one piece didn’t have holes drilled into it and needed to be returned for a new one. This was super annoying since it was very having.
60275812,Perfect for University Student Apartment. Needed inexpensive book shelve for apartment and of good quality. This unit is both and very easy to put together.
70301537,. We bought it for a basement family room. Went together pretty easily (we are not pros).
20278167,Followed instructions and the screws. Followed instructions and the screws would not stay in place causing the door to fall off.
30275861,"Love the shelf unit, but those inserts?!. I bought the 4x4 Kallax shelf unit to use in my craft room. I absolutely love it. It was easy to assemble by myself, and it fits perfectly in the space I needed it for. I decided to get 2 door inserts and 2 2-drawer inserts, figuring I'd be able to place them wherever and change whenever...ummm, no. Beware, if you decide to go with inserts, you have to screw them in to the sides of the cube you want it in. This will leave you with some ugly holes if you decide to rearrange the placement down the road. I thought I was buying simple inserts that could slide in to the spot, not making a permanent decision that would affect the aesthetic of the shelf unit itself."
50339292,"Looks great in my office!. Bought this for my home office to match some existing furniture. It looks great! Assembled by myself in about 2 hours. Printed directions could be a little better, but I figured it out!"
40303439,The great bookcase. Love this product very well made It was a great addition to my home office
10345073,"doubled my space. I purchased 2 of these attractive, functional baskets a month ago and am very happy with them. The plan was to store clothes in them, but those closet shelves are not open in the back so these did not fit. Instead, they work beautifully in my office and are holding office supplies, doubling the space of those shelves"
20278167,"Good & Not so Good. Love the unit. I have a few, but the 2 I just bought came with inadequate screws. They just wouldn't penetrate the sides of the Kallax unit - tried with 3 manual screw-drivers & my (strong) battery drill. Ended up using longer self-piercing screws which worked beautiful. I don't expect these kinds of problems with Ikea products."
20275885,. This is so useful in my closet love it. Also the price is great im happy customer
80275887,Perfect. I bought two units for my granddaughters bedroom!! Perfect for storing & organizing her toys and books.
20275885,"You can set vertical or horizontal. Can be used in any area of the home in my opinion. And love that that you can dress it up with a bin, drawers, or a door."
80275887,Excellent storage idea. Perfect system to hide all that extra stuff we have laying around!
50334591,Hard to put together and. Hard to put together and bigger than expected
70286645,. Great option for this shelf system.
40346924,Great Shelf Unit. Very easy to put together and it looks great
60333954,"Great shelf... once it's all put together. This shelf is great... now that we have it up. Putting it up was so difficult. You really have to follow the directions closely, which is fine, but the last piece (the back piece) didn't fit at all. We had to saw off a 1/4 inch piece off the top in order to make it work (and before we did that, we broke it a bit trying to get it to fit). SO frustrating!"
60278170,"Nice addition to my Kallax unit. This insert took my Kallax unit to the next level. I'm not one to read instructions, so it took me a little longer than I'm sure it was supposed to. I wish I would have purchased two inserts because I love the one I have now. The hinges are great quality and have held up to my heavy handed ways."
50214678,Ease of assembly !. Creat quality And Easy to put together
00334536,Now own 6 of these. Roomy cubes for books and toys. Be sure to get the back panel in the right way (bevels must fit all the way into the channel). In my set this meant label and white side are facing out through the grey bookcase. Not logical or aesthetically pleasing but the only way the fourth side of the box will go on.
80275887,Clean Lines. I like the look and simplicity of the Kallex shelf. I have one that I bought about 6 years ago. It looks more expensive and sturdier than this newer model. The newest model is a bit thiner on the outer frame. Also this one is a little bit duller in color. It's still a good value and looks good. It's just not as nice as the older one.
60275812,Great features!. This product met our needs perfectly. Also glad to be able to get red and gray for our OSU room.
80275887,"Sturdy and useful. Purchased it for my little ones bedroom. It’s sturdy and very useful to use as a book shelf and you organizer. It’s very easy to assemble, took me 30minutes."
80275887,"Fantastic product. Bought our first unit over a year ago. It’s been moved around and filled with stuff, and it’s holding up great. Since then we have purchased more, in different sizes for organizing books, craft rooms and work rooms. Love these things. Such flexibility with the different sizes, and a large capacity as well. One of the best purchases we’ve made for shelving!"
10275862,. Great product perfect for basement storage bins
20275885,. Needed this to add some decorating to my home.
20409936,"Multipurpose. I love this. You could basically use it for anything. Store your purses, shoes, library etc. We don’t wear shoes in the house so this is st our entry way and it’s just perfect. No more piles of shoes on the floor. The shelf unit is very sturdy."
00275848,Good quality. Bought this for extra storage and it’s perfect you can lay it stand it or even hang it on wall.
20275814,Kallax...WOW!!!!!. Kallax is a problem saver...so versitle...colorful...but more then anything is a storage saver...and with the boxes u can put in...it’s AMAZING!
50305739,. LOVE IT AND IT IS PERFECT FOR THE SPACE
70286645,"Pretty handy. I think I'd like it better if the drawers were a little deeper so that nothing could escape. They're shorter drawers on the inside than I originally thought, but it works well enough and is definitely a great addition to the kallax"
70342199,Packed Incorrectly. I have purchased this and IKEA made the mistake of packaging duplicate side frames. They did not pack the left and right but instead gave me two left. DO NOT BUY THIS. I live 1 hour away and am super busy with work. I don't even know if anyone should buy this. Look at the other reviews for the larger Fjallbo. Others are having the same issue.
70301537,Perfect board game shelving. Combined a few of these to create storage for my board game collection. Perfect size and versatility for all game box shapes and sizes.
40303439,Great. Very much more than expected
30275861,. Happy with purchase of products
40346924,Perfect size. Bought this a few weeks ago and it's perfect for my son's room instead of a dresser. I'm able to use the cube drawers to put his clothes in and the shelves for some toys and books.
00275848,"Kallax bookcase. We are using this bookcase as a bench to sit on, in our foyer.  Delivery & Assembly was easy. It is sturdy enough to hold a good amount of weight. I have ordered a custom cushion to place on top of it, for comfort. I have purchased baskets & placed them in the 4 pockets underneath & am storing warm, house socks for my grandchildren to wear, when they visit us! Thank you, IKEA!🌺"
39285808,"Nice simple bookshelf units!!. I’m quite pleased with these bookshelf units. They are extremely easy to assemble and have a very simple, elegant look. Mounting them on the wall with the optional bracket was a snap and made for a very secure fixture. Such a great value for the price too!! I definitely recommend them."
20213312,"I Love These Shelves!. I went to a high end furniture store to get bookshelves for my new apartment. After looking at their price and locating a visually identical item at IKEA, I was SO HAPPY I purchased these shelves. Great value and they are perfect."
50339292,"Awesome Table. I Love this table. Not only does it look sharp but it's sturdy, and very well made! I'm very pleased with my purchase!"
10275862,"Wonderful option for storage!. We choose to use this unit as a replacement for a dresser in our bedroom. We love the flexibility, being able to use bins as drawers, wire shelves for smaller items, and even leave some open spaces for photos and small items."
60275812,Turntable!!!!. Just the shelf I needed for my vintage turntable and albums
80275887,Love these shelves. Used it to organize my craft room and it’s great for those big odd shaped items
10409932,Great piece. I bought this along with a larger one and so happy I did. Large enough to hold books upright. Strong. Much nicer then other store brands.
20275814,Love it!. We have a number of these shelves in various sizes and configurations. They are sturdy. We love these shelves!
80275887,. I purchased a second one.
20275885,Perfect tv stand.. It holds my tv and knick knacks perfectly. I'm so happy I bought it! Took me about 30 minutes to put together. So easy.
40346924,Pretty and functional solution. I replace the biggest kallax in my daughters room as her needs have changed. This bookshelf is beautiful and functional for her books and toys.
60275812,Works perfectly for what we. Works perfectly for what we needed. We had a small space that needed something and this works great. Love that you can leave as is or put in baskets (also from ikea) that give it a different look.
80303437,Love this in White!. This is so much cuter in white than black!!!!
10409932,perfect for what I need. perfect for what I need but wanted a larger size which you never seem to have in stock.
10409932,Great Organizer. I brought this a month ago and I'm so happy I did. The cube is big enough to fit other brand 13 baskets. The finished is well made.
30275861,Great unit!. I had looked at it on the website since Christmas. When I got to the store I found it a little “loose” and I was concerned that it wouldn’t be sturdy enough. Because of the return policy I decided to take a chance. I’m glad I did! It is the perfect piece to start revamping a spare room into my sewing/craft room! The size is a great fit to put between the windows. I bought two sets of the drawers and am impressed enough to buy two more sets next time I’m there. The drawers are the just the place to store my crochet hooks and sewing needs. Glad I took the chance!
00275848,"Love love love this shelf unit!. I purchased 3 of these units to use 2 vertically on either side of one laid horizontally, this will be used as a bench while the cubbies will be used to house shoes in our garage."
60221683,"Strong, simple, useful. The FJÄLKINGE unit was super-easy to assemble, and holds a ton of books and standing-file boxes. But I'm disappointed in IKEA because: 1) they've stopped distributing the smaller shelving unit, which fit a broader range of spaces/uses; and 2) they no longer sells individual shelves, which gave the units needed flexibility. Come on!"
30275861,13 x 13 inch space squares is perfect!. I bought this for my craft room and I knew it would be perfect! I was going to buy the 3 by 4 but the 4 x 4 went on sale for the same price!
70286645,Great feature. Just what I need in my space
10409932,"Great Piece!. Super Cute Piece. The Wood is really durable and strong. All in all the piece is not too heavy, and I built it all by myself, wasn't too hard to put together. The only annoying part is the little wooden nails, it can be tough to push in some pieces.  Overall very nice piece ."
70339291,"Love the look, sturdy .. We love the look. It fits out country aesthetic while combining an industrial flair"
40346924,Just great. Really need it and fit perfect.
30275861,This works great. This works great for my craft room remodel. We bought a few of these and they are working out just great.
20275814,"Love these shelves. We have purchased several of these and keep coming back for more. They’re so practical and sturdy, we keep finding more places that we want them!"
10275862,Beautiful & Practical. I bought this in December for my teenage daughters room and I loved how it looks and how sturdy it is. I was surprised on how much I’m able to store and there’s no mess at all. I just loved it.
20275885,. I just love it!! Very easy to put together.
60275812,. I bought this a month ago and am so happy I did.
10409932,"Excellent storage space. This is perfect for my grand daughter play room. With the cubes, it gives us both covered storage areas and open shelf and bookcase sections. Each cube is just the right height when unit is played on its side. This is our second one. The first was used in the nursery closet floor for storage of all the little clothing and personal care items baby needed."
70286645,. I really love how this fits perfect and that they are draws.
00275848,"Quality book shelf!. Needed a book shelf to complete the new layout of my daughter’s bedroom, and this is the perfect size! It’s very durable and was very easy to put together! We love it!"
80275887,Cabinet space. Bought to use as ketchen cabinets. Works great so far. Did have to build a base for it as I have basedoard heating and it needed to be lifted over it. Ikea directions can be sketchy so be prepared
60333954,"Attractive, precise and useful storage.. I seriously don't understand how people found this difficult to put together. This was one of the *easiest* Ikea products I have ever put together, and I've done expedit, dressers, shelves, etc. This is ridiculously simple and for having pretty much no metal hardware is exceptionally precise in the way it goes together. For someone who is particular about details, symmetry and things being square and level, I was super impressed with the way this went together (bought the base for this and that was also simple and well engineered). Highly recommended! I just wish they offered the 2 cube model in colors other than white. Perfect for storing vinyl records or books."
79285830,Love the Look and Storage. Easy to assembly and attach to the wall. Smart choice for adding storage to an area.
60278170,Perfect. Great New look with the drawers n doors
20275814,"Great for storage!. I bought two of these for my kids' rooms and they work great (especially with added bins, drawers and door)."
80275887,"Just what I wanted. Used sideways in a small bedroom. Put fabric cubes with toys in some. Also small bookcase on top. Very sturdy, holds lots of stuff. The room looks much nicer and neater. I am pleased with this purchase."
70342199,Great Look. It’s was the exact dimensions we were looking for. And we end up using in a different location in our room to display our Knickknacks.
70301542,Just what I needed!. This is perfect for My Daughters Playroom. We love it......
60275812,"Perfect for Albums!. Was using a wooden orange crate to store my albums. Looked terrible and wasted tons of space. Purchased the KALLAX Shelf unit, and not only does it make the room look better, I have room for MORE RECORDS! Perfection!"
80275887,Great value!. I bought this last month to hold books for my children. This was easy to assemble and it is very sturdy.
60275812,"Fits perfectly. Went together easily, fits perfectly in the office."
70342199,Useful and sturdy. Useful and sturdy
10275862,"Great Shelf Unit. Solid construction, easy to put together. I placed this on top of two two-drawer file cabinets (2.5 feet wide each) to save space - works great. I especially like the fact that the depth is 13 inches."
70342199,Nice looking! Great value!. Husband just assembled this and it’s in a little niche in our hallway. Just the perfect size for the space! I love the look and can’t wait to decorate it with my books and a couple of baskets. Husband put it together with ease. No issues. Well worth the price.
80275887,". I have had many of these before and they are always worth their money. Cheap, easy to put together and last!"
80334603,Additional EKET. This cube is the perfect size for holding books or other objects. I had three already and bought this 4th one to add to. They are are perfect fit for under the window sill and I can use the top level for more display
20275814,Perfect size!. Perfect height to match our adjacent desk
10275862,"Great dresser alternative. I bought 4 of these. One for every bedroom, they look so much better than just your typical dresser."
00334536,Buy Kallax instead. This is worse than Kallax and harder to put together. I regret buying this.
50214678,great material. I bought it couple of wks ago and I'd easy to install and it looks great and the price was good.
70301537,Great piece. I bought this to take the place of different cabinets I had in one room. It made a big difference and help everything plus. So happy I bought this.
70339291,Harder than typical. Needed tools I didn’t have. IKEA furniture used to be so easy.
60275812,"Love the color!. I bought the grey. Great color and the end finish makes it look high-end! Fairly easy to put together alone, better with 2 people. Over all very good instructions and great sturdy product!"
10305741,"Good options for customized use. I like the fact that you can use the shelves in many ways, adding drawers, bins, doors or baskets as you wish. This makes the unit very flexible."
70301542,"Poorly constructed; overpriced.. This shelf replaces the far superior Besta shelf. It’s poorly constructed, flimsy and overpriced. Not recommended, even though it is one of the few inexpensive vinyl shelves available."
80275887,. I am so happy that I bought it around 6 months ago.
20275814,. It serves the purpose well.
10345073,Wire shelf. A bit on the expensive side. I love that they hook in the back to the shelf so my kids can't pull them off. And I like that they utilize the whole width and depth of the Kallax units. Wish they came in some other color than that gaudy goldish.
20275885,. I love how much I can organize.
20275885,"Very nice design.. Sturdy. Two dowel holes were not properly drilled. Went up ok without them. I added 7 various IKEA boxes and a 2 drawer enclosure to replace a dresser (much smaller footprint and holds more). Good to have your own tools, like a mallet, for example.."
80275887,Craft room favorite. I use this in my sewing/craft room and just love it.
90305803,Painfully easy to assemble and Lovely. I bought this a few weeks ago and it's wonderful It looks classy and easy to assemble we did three in one evening before heading to bed. One person can assemble it if needed.
20275814,. This is similar to the old expedit unit. Do wish they were identical.
90305803,"Absolutely perfect!. Love, love, love this! It added so much to my kitchen! Now I want another for my hallway!"
20275814,Sturdy. Much better than the one I got at another store.
20275814,Takes up less space. I needed extra storage in my guest bedroom and it looks great in there. got it on sale last month.
10409932,"Just what we needed. doens't fit together perfectly, some tiny gaps. but looks pretty good and seems stable. good for the price."
20213312,"Sturdy, levels well. Easy assembly, great for display use"
60275812,". Love the product, made a perfect bar for me"
70301542,Great solution. Perfect for a book collection and collectibles.
60278170,"Looks great!. Bought 2 initially, after my husband installed the first 2 inserts, he liked them so much that he bought 2 more inserts."
70339291,"Stylish Shelf. I love the look of this shelf--rustic/industrial. My teenage son chose it for his bedroom. It seems stable (but not heavy) and can hold a lot. It added a bit of style to his minimalistic room. It wasn't too hard to assemble, but be sure to pay attention to how to orient the pieces. I messed up a couple of times and had to redo several steps."
50214678,Love the shelveing space not to heavy not to light. I bought this a month ago I'm so happy with the purchase works great for what I wanted it for.
80401292,". I used this in my craft room and love it. Easy to assembly, sturdy and well built. I am going to buy another next time I am IKEA."
70301537,"Wonderful shelf but you will need a buddy to help. This is a pretty solid shelf unit. We are using ours as a room divider on carpet and it's not wobbly at all. I really love how deep the individual cubbies are too. One thing to note is that if you want to use the fabric cubes, you will need ones that are deep (or just leave a gap in the back). I made a happy mistake buying pretty ones that were exactly the height and depth I needed. Also, you will need a buddy to build this. I tried to build it by myself and there is no way. You will need someone to brace the shelf and someone to push the shelf. Trust me...this will make building it faster and easier. Overall, it's a wonderful shelf for whatever you need it for."
10305741,"Perfect kitchen Island. I bought the white gloss, added some fantastic accessories and some wheels, placed three cutting boards on the top and voila! kitchen island with great storage for under $200"
70301542,"Super storage!. I love this piece so much, I bought a second one. It’s attractive, super functional and a fantastic deal! It’s huge BUT easy to put together. I use it in my sons room partially a dresser and the top 2/3 as shelves for his stuff. In my extra room I use Ikea containers in 20 of the squares to store everything from games to craft stuff to office supplies. Everything is tidy and labeled. Love it!!"
19278272,Very handy to use.. Purchased Expedit several years ago and these new units are quite similar.
30275861,"Exactly what I needed.. Very nice unit. I purchased two and was able to assemble them myself. I needed help getting the assembled units upright and in place, but that's what sons-in-law are for."
70339291,"Great bookcase. Went together well, looks great, sturdy."
90286649,I want to love them. I actually do like these drawers. I was very disappointed in the quality of them though. One set (I bought 5) the edging completely came off. I didn’t check the boxes apparently when I bought them and the box looked like someone tried to bend it. So my recommendation is to check your boxes!!
10275862,"Great Cheap Storage. This storage unit was bought for storage in my tween’s bedroom. It took about an hour for my husband and myself to put together. I love the added wall harness, really adds to the sturdiness. I can’t wait to get the cute colorful baskets to complete the look."
60275812,Amazing space saver and display shelves. I’m very very happy that I purchased the shelves...My husband secured them to the wall as a wall unit so I can display my father’s vinyl collection
30275861,Great Product. We was looking for this bookcase that was very strong.
20275885,Disappointed. I have the same shelving unit from a few years ago that I love; very solid and on wheels. I wanted a second unit to organize my crafting supplies... it is significantly thinner and less sturdy. IKEA doesn’t even sell the wheels! I wish IKEA would go back to the original design. My husband calls it the “wobbly one.”
30275861,"Great, love it.. It’s a wonderful unit for the room of a 15year old girl. She loves it."
20275885,TV stand. As always it was easy to put together and I enjoy it as a tv stand with storage.
70301537,Very bad. I bought it few days ago very poor quality no strong I bought it for children toys and book and now I don' know what to do it moving side to side I am very desepondet
20275885,Work perfectly in my closet!!!. Organized things on the closet floor not requiring any construction.
79278269,"Perfect size!. My husband needed this by his chair for his stuff. We chose the drawers (on rollers!) for the top and doors for the bottom. It took a while to put together (tools required), but was well worth the effort! We are happy with how it looks and his stuff is hidden!"
70286645,"Best Improvement Ever. Whoever dreamt up these drawer inserts deserves a raise! LOVE THEM. They add a whole world of organizing possibilities and really make the KALLAX units multi-functional. *Tip: add a bit of wood glue when putting the side rails on the drawers. If you've owned IKEA items with drawers before, you know that the rails can sometimes come loose or break. Adding the wood glue provides extra stability and they handle weight much better."
80275887,"Easy to assemble, sturdy, and looks great!. My husband had no trouble assembling the bookcase (which cannot be said for several other IKEA items we've purchased that were more difficult). It is very sturdy and looks fantastic (soooo much nicer than particle-board bookcases we have bought in the past). We chose to use it horizontally as a toy cubbie for our son, and we bought the corresponding DRÖNA boxes/bins."
10275862,Perfect fit. I traded out my traditional dresser for this unit and I couldn't be happier. Fits wonderfully in the space and makes the room look larger!
60275812,"Hate the exposed screws. Like the shelf unit, it was easy to assemble. I don’t understand why the screws are exposed on the top. I’m using this more for decoration than hard core storage so maybe that’s why it bothered me enough to write a review."
70342199,"Ok. Harder to put together than anticipated, the instructions aren't very clear. They also don't hold as much as I wanted, the shelves are either too big for one item or too small when you try to double up on items. Bit odd"
40346924,"Perfect. I bought this after thinking about it for a while. I'm so happy I took the leap. It's perfect, easy to put together and easy to clean."
10345073,"Classy organizer. I was drawn to the gold color and the interesting structure of this organizational item. I didn’t realize it is designed for a specific shelf, which i do not have, so I am not sure how well it will be utilized in my home but I am trying to come up with a creative solution. I hope sometimes similar releases soon that can be for any shelf."
60333954,"Broke 2 trying to put them together. Like someone else on this thread, I registered just so that I could warn you about this unbelievably frustrating product. There are no normal screws or the usual IKEA dowels on this. Instead, you must line up some very poorly cut holes with these plastic widgets and then force them down into the narrower part of the hole. But if you use any force whatsoever to get them to line up, the plastic wedges snap -- and there is no other way to put them together. I bought three and broke two in a row. I'm not even going to try the third. I'm returning all three tomorrow. For context, I've assembled at least a dozen other IKEA pieces in the past, and I've got 2 Master's degrees. Not sure what sort of training you need to put these EKET cubes together, but I don't have it. I cannot recommend against this product strongly enough."
10275862,Fantastic. I am a minimalist & this shelf is awesome! It’s extremely versatile. I can easily access everything I need and it keeps us very organized. My husband had it assembled really fast to.
00275848,Great!!. I’m using this product as a shelve for TV.
60275812,Perfect - kid loved it. This is great for Lego organization
60333954,"Last piece won't fit. Got the unit assembled exactly as per the instructions, but the last piece absolutely will not go in with the back board in place. Taking it apart again broke the fitting off one piece as well as splintered the holes around another. Looks good in the showroom, but not sturdy enough to be dismantled. Can't recommend it."
20275814,"Great closet organizer. This is my second, stacked on top of the first. Great for organizing my closet."
10305741,"Poorly Designed. Good appearance, works well. Came with small damage on surface, but this is ok for me. The only thing I cannot accept is that the shelf is suuuuuuper difficult to assemble. It is extremely hard to insert small wood sticks into holes on board, which makes the wood sticks so easy to snaps. Thank to the stupid wood stick, my finger got hurt. I hate this design, indeed. Why don't you just give more screws?"
20275814,Great organization piece.. Great organization piece.
60333954,. Very difficult to assemble on the last step of putting the top on like the other reviews comment on. I will have to return it.
70301537,"Perfect organizer!. Love, love, love my sewing room organizer! Every project is off the floor and ready to be worked on and finished! Every quilter should have this!"
70301537,space saver. so happy with my recent purchase. it fits perfectly
90286649,. purchased for husband to go in his kallax
40275846,Bought for additional storage in. Bought for additional storage in a small space next to two other cabinets in the same color. It works wonderfully.
20275885,"Excellent value, great look!. Using as TV stand in first apartment. Great look, very quick and easy to assemble."
00314642,"Great for small storage. Purchased this to add to a 2x4 Kallax in the walnut effect color. Didn't realize how glossy the high gloss white would be, but it looks nice (reminds me of a white board). Pretty easy to assemble (~20min), and the drawers glide nicely. Had to screw it into the Kallax, so if we ever want to change the location or flip the orientation of the shelf, we'll have to figure out how to cover up the holes. We did not pre-drill holes and it worked okay. Also, there are markings on the top edge of the drawer for the material type/recyclability that I assumed were a peel off adhesive, but they are not. Pretty ugly since that's what you see every time you open the drawer. Not sure why that wouldn't be in a less visible spot."
50339292,Fabulous shelf unit. Fabulous shelf unit
70301542,"Liked it so much I bought a second. I bought this originally for my daughters bedroom. This thing is massive but it is amazing! I liked it so much I bought a second one for my office. My husband put the first one together, but I was able to put the second one together. You definitely need two people to put it together."
10345073,Fits snugly. Makes a great divider for my Kallax shelving in my sewing room
60221683,. Good strong unit and designed well and looks good.
70301537,Great shelving unit. I purchased one of these 15 years ago and we just moved and dismantled it and it went back together perfectly. Purchased another to use to store fabric in my sewing room
20275814,great bookshelf/organizer. easy for assembly. good size for placing anywhere as an organizer. matches well with other bookshelves/organizers from Ikea
70342199,Very pleased with this shelf unit.. Looks very nice and was what I expected. Easy to assemble.
20275885,Eh. It’s not as well made as it used to be. Cheap partial board.
29278262,easy assembly. really happy about this product
30275861,Love it. Very useful . You can organize any space in minutes . And very good price . I love you IKEA.
10305741,Great product. Bought this about a month ago looks great use it to keep my dogs toys and leashes made them they're little corner and just ties it up perfectly
50339292,"Nice industrial feel. Nice industrial feel that's just warm enough to not look dated when the trend passes. Over 20 years time I have bought countless pieces from Ikea, I still have many of them and they still look relevant and timeless."
60278170,Good value.. Good value.
60275812,Perfect size. Love it! Perfect size for kid room
30275861,Excellent storage space. Bought this piece to use in my crafting area. Easy to assemble. Works great for storage!
00275848,Great storage. Great storage
50334591,Great. I bought this 2 months ago and it looks amaizing in my living room.
20275814,Great price and looks pretty. Great way to hide toys and keep nursery organized.
20275885,Nice & Sturdy!. I love this shelf. I love how sturdy it is. I have it laying the short way. It fits perfectly! Super easy to assemble. Love it.
39017486,Very attractive shelving. Very attractive shelving
80275887,Looks Great. Assembly was pretty easy and they look great!
40346924,"Scratches easily. Great and modern color combination, however if accessorized with Kallax inserts, it scratches easily."
70342199,"It was too small for my space.. It's adorable -- would have loved to keep it, but it was too small."
60275812,I am happy with this item. I’m happy with the purchase of item
70286645,easy install. Already owned 6 sets of these drawers. Love them so much. Wanted more. Couldn't organize my art/craft studio without them.
50339292,"Love this!. I bought this around a month ago and I put my espresso machine on it, set it up as a little coffee bar. It works great! Very sturdy and easy to put together."
20275885,So easy to assemble!. I purchased two of these shelves 3 years ago for the first time while on sale. I love the versatility of these shelves. The bookcase can be used standing upright or laying down on the side. And it's sturdy. Assembly was a snap.
40415601,Perfect for my needs. We bought this to serve as storage space in a home studio. It looks good & with addition of drawer units & reed boxes looks great in the room.
10305741,Nice look!. Looks nice with high gloss!
20275814,. .....just added another unit to the 8 I already have.  Love them!
10275862,. I bought this a month ago. It took my brother-in-law 45 minutes to put it together. I really like it.
60275812,Simple. Perfect simple plain unit. We have every size and use them as bookshelves all throughout our house.
80275887,Great Features. This is my second one and is easy to put together. It holds everything I need it too.
60278170,"door hangs open. I bought this last weekend for organization in my Harry Potter decorated office. I installed it step by step the same day. For some reason, and maybe yes I should've used an electric screw driver, but my door will not close all the way and hangs open. I had a hard time screwing and securing the insert into the side of the Kallax bookshelf."
40415601,Great storage!. I already had two 8 cubes and decided to add more storage in my sewing room by purchasing 2 9 cubes and 2 more 8 cubes. They were easy to put together and look really nice. These are more sturdy and attractive that what you would buy at other retailers!
20275885,So great wish I bought another!. I love the size of the cubbyhole fits what I want!
20275885,. I changed my living room..good choice
10345073,"great hanging file basket. I wish it was in silver, but the basket helps me divide my cubby space in half."
70286645,. Great addition to the storage unit. Easy to assemble and work smooth.
10305741,Perfect for toys. Worked perfectly as toy storage. Great priced product. But disappointment that the night glass cracked in a few places whilst hammering in the dowels. Didn’t happen with my previous 3 expedit bookcases. Had to use a thick towel over the wood before hammering to stop this
10275862,Looks good!. Bought this for my bedroom to use as a display/book shelf. It looks so much better than the average bookshelf. I also bought some baskets to use in this to store random items. I really like it.
60333954,Perfect for my bathroom. I love it it fits in the space perfect
70301542,Create library. This is a great way to organize my very large book collection
30275861,"Perfect shelves. This is the perfect shelf. Perfect size. You can leave it like this or you can add the inserts like drawers, doors and half shelf inserts."
00415599,(((NiCe))). I put this up myself. I only need help to turn it over to put in the other screws. i haven't decorated my living room in about 10 years. This 9 cube shelf comes in very handy... As I am becoming a little more of a minimalist. This item looks so nice in my living room after I placed 4 black drona boxes on the shelf. It looks so nice.
20275885,"This is a great purchase. We got this after discussing how we wanted to organize a bunch of equipment we had. We had seen other versions of this shelf, but were immediately struck by the versatility, and we weren't 100% what way we wanted this facing. We LOVED that the basket choices were many and that they really filled the slot up. It is solid and surprisingly easy to set up (we have had some other furniture set ups that definitely were NOT simple). It looks great in our spot, and now we are considering adding another, smaller unit next to it for even more space."
70342199,Perfect shelf for a confined space. Bought for office alcove...works and looks great
60275812,". I bought this product one month ago, I like it"
20275885,"Wonderful TV Stand. My husband and I recently moved into our first home and wanted a functional TV stand. We are both gamers which means we needed plenty of storage for our consoles, controllers and games. It was very easy to put together and the materials were very sturdy. It makes our living room pop! We love it and would recommend to those looking for a different type of TV stand."
20275814,. The shelf unit fit perfectly in the space
20275885,"Pretty good but wish it was made better. I bought this to use temporarily as a TV stand and later will use to divide a shared kids bedroom. I like it and overall am happy with it, but giving 3 stars because one of the last screws to hold together would not catch on the treads in the particle board, so it’s just sticking out and won’t screw in all the way."
20275885,"Very Versatile. I like this shelf unit because it looks good, can be used as a bookcase, disiplay cabinet, or room divider, and can be used with a desk or other shelf units. I like to keep things neat with the various baskets and bins that IKEA makes to fit on the shelves."
29278304,Looks great in our office!!. Looks great in our office!!
20275885,. I’ve bought this item several times for myself & as a gift. I love it!
20275814,I like it so I. I like it so I bought four of them
80275887,"Kallax Shelves. I absolutely love my new shelf. Price is right, assembly easy and very sturdy. May get another :)"
70301537,great for kitchen storage. great for kitchen storage;  See photo
00415599,". This works great in our master bedroom as a TV stand. Looks stylish and functional. Only complaint I have is that during install, we found two of the screw spots weren't drilled all the way through which meant we had to drill then ourselves. Not a big detractor but definitely a set back."
10409932,"Kallax is our favorite. We bought a set of Kallax cubbie-shelves for my mother, who recently moved into a very tiny apartment. The shelves solved her storage-shortage problem. We've used these shelves for years and they are a great solution in any room."
20275885,"Sturdy and versatile. My husband and I have bought 3 of these now, two for our closet and one for our son’s bedroom. We like that they can function lengthwise or widthwise along the floor and use them both ways. If we need another shelf, we will most like get another one if it fits."
20275885,"shelf. I got this for my daughters bedroom, she loves it,"
10305741,". Happy with this shelf, nice and simple"
40415601,Perfect size. Just what I needed for pictures and other items
70342199,Fjallbo Shelf Unit is great for potted plants.. I use this shelf for my plant collection. I like that the mesh shelves allow for air ventilation and light to travel through. Putting it together is not hard. You will need a Phillips screwdriver and a little bit of patience to line things up. The very top shelf is solid wood without any pre-drilled holes. I was surprised because most of IKEA's products have all the holes ready for you. I like that it doesn't have any particle board and feels solid but lightweight enough for one person to move around.
10275862,Nice. Exactly what i needed.. I bought this along with a LINNMON Tabletop to build a desk. It was very easy to build and very sturdy. Looks great in my room!
80275887,My fourth KALLAX. KALLAX is an icon. I bought this one to store my record collection. I have others with drawer bins and doors for storage. The fact that you can buy copies at Target and Walmart shows what a great idea it is...
00334536,"Handy size, just wish it came in better colors. The cubby size is perfect and the height and width of the unit makes it very versatile. I only wish it could be offered in styles and colors that match other IKEA lines, such as BESTA and BILLY. We wanted to match ours with Black-Brown BILLY, so will likely end up painting it."
00275848,. Quick & easy setup! Looks great!
10275862,Love it!. It works perfect in the space I have. Easy assembly. Wanted white but they were always out. The dark looks good too. No complaints.
10275862,Make sure to redrill all the holes!. i love ikea and have bought so many things. but this product...i broke about 4 wooden pegs trying to redrill the holes. if you are going to buy this redrill or just have it assembled by a professional. will probably try to use hot glue or something to fix the wooden pegs. glad i bought it when it was on sale.
20275885,Great product!. So happy with this product. It was easy of assembly and it has a great quality!
70339291,"Easy on the eyes and functional. Bought this for pantry storage in my kitchen and I love the industrial look! Even though it's not super sturdy (not heavy steel), it's sturdy enough to do the job.  I suggest reading the instructions thoroughly before assembling. I was able to put it together in about an hour with a few mistakes (not reading the instructions) along the way. You do have to make your own holes into the wooden boards to secure with screws, but it's not as bad as it sounds."
70391038,". We bought this about a month go to replace another book as we had. We love that this is made with wood and fits well in our space, it's taller and doesn't take as much space. It allows for larger items in the bottom as well. Very happy with purchase. It took my hubby and I to put together, maybe about 45 mins."
80275887,Great!!!. Perfect for my daughter’s room. Reliable!!
70342199,"Beautiful in Show Room, Perfect for My Home!. Over a month of owning this piece and I am beyond happy I purchased it! Honestly, if it would fit anywhere in your home then I guarantee you will not be disappointed"
10275862,Simple and nice. It's great! The quality is perfect for what I wanted.
20275814,"Cute storage. East to assemble, looks cute. Not wide enough for the base of a 50” TV just an FYI"
10275862,"The classic shelves. There's not a ton to say about this. It does exactly what it looks like, and does it well. I bought this to store my board games, along with some books, and the divided shelf space is great for keeping things organized. It looks good, it has a ton of space to place things, it's pretty sturdy (definitely more than other IKEA stuff I've had) ... this would definitely be my recommendation for anyone who needs some shelves for whatever reason."
00275848,This piece is super functional. I use it as a TV stand and love it! It wasn’t too hard to assemble.
80275887,"Very good!. We got kids toys, under the out tv! It works great!"
20275814,Great little shelves. Could not b any happier with the storage these shelves afford me.
20275885,Love the diversity for usage.. Horizontal/ vertical usage fits perfectly !
60275812,. Very happy with this book shelf...thank you IKEA!
70301537,Kallax 6 foot by 6 foot shelving unit. I bought this 3 weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I put it in my sewing room to hold fabric. It works even better than I had hoped  I also bought 5 drawer units and I love them too.
30275861,"Great for homeschooling!. This piece helps keep our homeschool supplies organized, easy to access, and looking great."
80275887,Awesome Storage. Super easy to put together and is extremely versatile..
80275887,Our second unit.... We bought the KALLAX shelf unit several years ago. We were so happy with it that we just purchased another unit for a different room in our home.
20275885,. I bought this for my daughter's room to organise her toys. It is perfect.
70301542,Wonderful bookcase. This bookcase was easy to assemble alone and holds all my craft items. It fits 13x13 boxes and also has drawers and doors available.
10275862,impossible to put together without. the peg holes were too small in 75% of them. requires hammering them in separately just to try to make the hole bigger. frustrating task assembling these. gaps in shelving too.
60278170,"Unique. Pros: it compliment the bookshelves, very functional, look modern Cons: not as easy to install, takes time"
99017445,". I bought this to store teaching supplies & loooove it! It is made of solid construction materials, better value than other box stores comparable items & versatility of doors etc. Highly recommend. Great value too."
50339292,Strong went together with no problems.. Great check it out you will behappy
20275885,display set uup. I bought this as a Christmas present for my adult grandson. He was looking for something to organize abd display a collection. This piece works great in his space.
60278170,"look nice, easy to assemble. these add so much to the Kallax room dividers. They turn Kallax into something much nicer. I also bought a two-tiered Kallax set, turned it on it's side, added white inserts to the bottom and turned it into a workable side table and shelf in my guest room/art studio. They look nice."
00275848,"Walk-In Closet & Laundry Room. A great solution for my new walk-in closet and for my laundry room! I bought a total of 10 Kallax shelving units - I used 3 of the 2 wide x 4 tall units (standing vertically) and topped them each with a 2 wide x 2 tall unit.  I used double hanging rods between them.  I used the last of the 2 wide x 2 tall horizontally and hung it to be level with the center 2 sections of the vertical unit. I added drawer inserts and purchased jewelry organizers for them -- then added a vanity mirror and a rack for hanging long necklaces and WOW -- a great closet for almost no money. (I did buy quality cabinet knobs for the drawers to replace the small/ugly modern ones).  The 1 wide x 4 tall units went into my laundry room (with door fronts), so I can neatly organize & store all the cleaning and ironing items. They look great and hold so much! (Again, bought quality knobs for the door fronts) Lastly, I'd like to say that I assembled all of these and attached them to the wall by myself -- I'm a small senior female, so if I can do it, anyone should be able to. I really like the way the directions are presented -- the drawings make everything very clear and simple to follow. In all, a great experience -- the worst part is schlepping to IKEA to get the units vs having them delivered (IKEA -- you need to talk to Amazon to make online shopping/delivery easy and affordable). I really love the look and the functionality of my closet and my laundry room, and my friends are just amazed!"
60275812,Perfect. Love the versatility and price of the case.
50339292,". Love this piece, much nicer than I initially thought it would be. Can’t beat the price!"
60275812,Super good. Extremely happy I will buy them again no doubt rhus pueces gives a profesional look to the room
70339291,. I am so happy my purchases
80275887,Playroom toy organization. I purchased two shells and laid them on their sides so I could story and organize my children’s toys into basket. They are very sturdy and look beautiful in their playroom.
80275887,Space saver. Needed this for my daughter's room and it worked perfectly to open up more space and store all of her things.
20275814,Great deal for the affordable. Great deal for the affordable price!
70301542,"Changed size. We bought this shelving unit a few years ago and love it.  We decided to get another one to go next to the one we already have.  You would think it would be the same, but no. For some reason Ikea thought it would be a good idea to change the width of the outside edges and now they are not the same height.  So be sure to double check every little detail if you are trying to match something new to something you already have.  Even if it's the same thing, it might be different."
10305741,"Too elegant!. absolutely beautiful, durable and functional When it comes to a beautiful storage, no other IKEA product works as functional. We used the book shelving in a whole new way to make an office wall unit."
70301537,"This is my fourth and fifth of these units.. I bought this about a month ago and love the organization it brings to my shop. I sew, do embroidery, applique, rhinestones and vinyl so I have many items to organize."
70286645,"Love these!. I use my Kallax to store metal stamping supplies. These drawers are fantastic. They open and close much more smoothly than pretty much any other piece of furniture I have. I have a couple of drawers full of stamp sets, which are basically blocks of solid metal. The drawers glide open and closed just like they were empty and don't have trouble with the weight at all. I'd recommend these to anyone!"
10305741,"Not nearly as nice as they used to be.. We had bought Kallax series shelves in the early days of Ikea's arrival in the U.S. and up in to the early 2000s. Back then the products were well made and very reasonably priced. Now, all they are is cheap. We were very disappointed in the drop in quality of these shelving units. I would much rather pay a little more and get the same quality they used to have than buy something just plain cheap in price and quality. We still have several of our old units that we've moved from home to home and room to room. They've withstood the wear and tear. These new ones definitely won't. The hollow core sides, the thinner shelves and cheaper chip board are not hearty enough to withstand assembly, let alone use! I had to be extra careful after tapping a wood peg into one of the holes and it push out the wood on the other side of the exterior wall. The chip board was already flaking from the ends of the shelf boards and easily flaked as the pegs were tapped in. The color was rubbed off or not painted to the edges of several of the shelves. Very, very disappointed in this product and Ikea's obvious reduction in quality."
20275885,Good for the price. Looks better than it should. It was difficult to put the dowels in place with a hammer. A little bit too much hammering to get the dowels in place caused some of the wood to chip off. Still looks good though.
70301542,perfect for library storage. I use two of these as storage for my home library and they are perfect! They are incredibly easy to put together (although you put them together on their side and then have to lift them upright and they are HEAVY. Definitely don't skip the step with the looped strap). I've had my original one for three years and it still looks brand new.
70286645,Great fit. The drawer units fit perfectly with the shelving unit. I love them
80275887,Just what I needed!. Added to my “fabric wall” in the sewing room by stacking this on top of the 16 cubby unit—basic storage solution at a good price
80275887,Awesome!!. I own two sets and love them both.
40346924,Lego Storage. These shelves are great for Lego storage and look very nice in my kids' room.
50339292,Great shelf. Bought this piece for the kitchen for extra storage. Perfect size and easy to put together.
80275887,"Kallax shelf, LOVE IT!. This is the 2nd Kallax shelving unit I have bought. The 1st one is upright using the Drona bins for clothes in my grandson’s room. I bought the 2nd and laid it on its’ side and put toys and Drona bins in that one. AWESOME and space-saving. I highly recommend these, and make sure you attach the upright one to the wall for safety. And they are made in the USA!"
20275814,"You just can't get enough.. I have been a huge fan of ikea cubes, starting with expedition and now kallax. We have the 8, 16 and 4 cubes. They look awesome in any decoration and SO easy to assemble and organize stuff. Super sturdy. I love those!"
40303439,"Perfect shelf for small plants. This shelf is great in my sunroom to keep my plants more organized. The height between shelves is enough for plants in 4-6 inch containers, and the clear glass let’s more light through to the lower layers. It was a little annoying to assemble the solid boards because they aren’t pre-drilled, but not too hard."
10275862,Beautiful and strong. My son put this together for me; beautiful color And exactly as it looks in the pic. Holds all of my treasures
90286649,works great. we got this for my son's room and it works great for his stuff.
10275862,Great. So great I bought 2. Works for any type of organization.
80303437,"Beautiful for my bathroom. It’s just perfect for the bathroom, makes a nice display with a few baskets to hol extra tissue and towels"
60275812,Great storage for vintage record albums. This is the second shelf we’ve purchased. First time it was the larger one we purchased. After filling it with our vintage vinyl collection we decided on another one to finish the project of organizing records. It is sturdy enough to hold a few hundred records which can be heavy. Its nice enough to have in the music room with comfy furniture to relax and listen to the oldies.
10409932,Great for crafters. I love this piece. I use it for my paper crafting supplies.
80275887,kallax. great product woul highly recommend easy to put together
40275846,. I am so happy my purchase
80275887,Problem solved. Easy to put together. Took my brother only 2 hours to put 2 shelving units together. Using Kallax with inserts to store craft paper. Great Idea
80275887,Kallax shelf unit. Easy to put together and deep enough for my yarn and fabric.
70301542,"Very easy to assemble.. Mounted to the wall, useing as my headboard, my cat loves it too!"
10409932,"Perfect!. I purchased this shelving unit to help organize my math and reading curriculum, games, and manipulatives. It fit perfectly in the spot I wanted it and has so much storage."
00415599,"Look good, work well. I’m organizing my studio and these storage units are just great for that. They look so clean and neat and are so useful. The 15” cubical openings fit almost any size book and adding bin inserts and drawer inserts makes spaces perfect for storage of awkward odds ends. Is the quality great? No, but good enough. Are they affordable? Yes.  A bother to assemble? Maybe, but you only do that once."
20275814,Well constructed. I sm extremely happy with my purchase of the kallax. Very spacious cubbies and looks fantastic in my office.
80275887,"Just what I needed. Actually purchased two of these units in white and one in dark brown. One now has the wheels on it and the other is stationary. The one with the wheels has a painted back on it -- an iKea hack -- and coordinates with cabinets I built. The other is part of an office set up and is sleep, offers storage (with iKea drawers) and iKea boxes to fit in the spaces. The brown one is being used, with drawers and a door, also with iKea storage boxes, as a nightstand. I couldn't be happier."
10275862,"Great Piece..My whole quilting studio is Kallax. You will not be disappointed. Sturdy, yet attractive, the finishing piece to my quilting studio."
10409932,. Just what I need for my roo.
20275885,Great. Works wonderful for our office
30275861,"Shelf unit. Great for storage, bookshelf, organizing, whatever you need."
10345073,Looks amazing. Looks expensive. A little bit flimsy with heavier items
40415601,"Great shelf unit. We bought it for the office, I do really love it, it looks really cool"
90286649,Just great. These drawers converted a plain unit into an interesting piece of furniture. I added decorative knobs and it’s now a conversation piece
20213312,"Really nice. I should buy more!. We bought this for our bedroom. We needed some extra shelving for knicknacs, and this was perfect. Now I'm thinking the living room and dining room could use one of their own."
30275861,"Great idea for divider. I brought this yesterday told me about 35-40 mins to put it together . Easy as pie , u cant go wrong with the steps are super basic . No cracks , no missing pieces. My divider looks great !! Cant beat the price !! I love the of how thick it is overall . It doesn’t look cheap or flimsy."
80275887,"the high gloss white laminate can shatter and chip. I'm a fan of the old Expedit bookcases - I have two in birch and they've held up quite well. This is my first time trying Kallax and my experience has been a bit mixed. While the price is excellent, I'd rather pay a little more and get a higher quality unit like Expedit. While the basic look and feel is similar to Expedit, I'm disappointed there isn't a birch option. I went with the high-gloss white and it has some issues. First off, the edges all come wrapped in protective tape that's a real bear to remove. Second, the laminate shatters to pieces when your hammer strays even a tiny bit off the mark during assembly. I get it - it's my fault that I don't use a hammer most days so my aim is off, but the result is that my new shelf unit doesn't look so new. I just hope the damaged areas don't flake off any further."
70301542,"Great Addition to Help with Storage Issue. I just assembled this shelf. It took les than 2 hours for two people together. Nice and sturdy. I think it is good quality and attractive. I was concerned it would look cheap, but it looks real nice. I am happy with my purchase."
20278167,"good idea. but didn't really work. the screws require extra steps to actually get into the shelf sides. Read nail first, then a bigger screw, finally the screw that comes in the package. also, my door doesn't really close. kind of pops out beyond the shelving unit. positive - you can easily remove the back of the insert if you want to use that shelf for something with cords."
70301537,"Best modular furniture build yet. I've put together hundreds of modular furniture pieces and this one is by far the best planned and executed I've ever seen. Instead of using lots of weak screw connections this uses dowels (I love to add glue to them) that have better holding power and are cheaper to provide, easier to install and last longer. The instructions used no text to explain the process and were extremely easy to follow. The overall sturdiness and solidarity of this furniture is far and above the rest. It comes in 4 boxes which also make carting it around much easier to do."
10275862,GReat to organizer for small areas. I love this product. I’m able to create more room
80275887,. The product work well for the use of my granddaughter's toys and things
20275814,"What a great deal. I was lucky enough to find this gem in the 'As Is' room, complete with a 2 drawer addition and two door assemblies. Yahoo! It's going to be perfect for various scrapbooking supplies that require accommodation of 12x12 items."
40415601,Perfect for our storage needs. My husband's album collections fits beautifully in this unit!
80275887,"versitility is great. easy to assemble, easy to move around, versatility is great. décor is spot on. perfect for storage."
10345073,"Oh well. I took this home and painted it and after it dried took it in and went to install and found out it didn't fit, my Ikea cabinet was not deep enough. Not sure if I bought the wrong size or It was on display in a different cabinet but now I cant use it. lol"
19278328,Great look. I purchased this product this month and I went back and brought another and I am so glad I did because it open my family room up to giving it this look of elegant.
10305741,"Great item.. I love the Kallax. It took me a couple minutes to realize there was a protective film on the sides of the shelves, top and bottom. Was relatively easy to put together but it is best to have 2 people do this. I didn't like that the dowels had to be hammered through the shelf and the hammer caused a little minor damage...nothing noticeable unless you know it's there. Best to try to use a rubber mallet maybe. But all in all, I really like it. I plan on buying some inserts but haven't gotten that far yet."
00314642,"Low quality and weird fit. These are easy to assemble. However, you need to screw them to the Kallax shelves. So, as others have mentioned, once they are in, they are in. My drawers did not slide in in such a way that they are level or that did not leave a gap at the top or the bottom. I had purchased two. One is going back, one is going in the trash."
60333954,"Don't worry, you can do it too.. In spite of the negative reviews by a couple of others, the Eket CAN be put together successfully. Just follow the pictorial instructions, and use your brain a little. What you end up with is a very structurally sound cabinet that is PERFECT for LP records! When the back is slid in, the top piece put on, and the clips inserted into the holes behind the back panel, the enclosure becomes very stiff and stable, unlike the somewhat wobbly Kallax, which has no back panel. I love the Eket!"
90305803,Beautiful. I like so much lux beautiful in my living room
10305802,Love this. I wanted to switch from a heavy yourself to a lighter weight one for any future moves. And I’m very glad that I did it’s beautiful and it’s working out well
20275814,Assembly. Very easy a caveman could do it.
30275861,"love these, so versatile. Used these to organize the hodge-podge of shelves and misc storage in my home office. *Contented sigh.* Looks good, works great. Use it to store, display, etc. Not my first Kallax."
20275814,"Always a Versatile Favorite. We wanted two eight cube units and the store was sold out so we bought four of the four cube units and what was a disappointment at first worked out to be a plus. We place two together but now have the ability to split them up in different places in the room, move one to another room, etc. They are solid and not difficult to assemble."
40346924,Love the colors!. Easy to assemble between two people. Beautiful combination of colors.
60275812,Good space. So happy is very easy for me.. grest space on my room!
10409932,Excellent value. The shelf unit fit perfectly in my space and with my decor
20275885,"We love these, have 5!. We first bought one of these units to use horizontally as a plant/ book stand. We liked it so well that we bought two more for the hallway to our back deck. They hold a mix of things. When we redid our loft library we bought two more to use as book shelves. The unit is sturdy and easy to assemble."
40415192,High Quality Furniture and affordable. Great quality. Superb execution. Solid Wood with no visible finger joins. Two choices of colour. Strong units. Many combinations are possible. This is furniture to keep for long time.
20275885,. This is the perfect product that went well with the style and color of the bedroom
10305741,"Wonderful storage unit. I bought this Kallax shelt unit for my craft room, and it just fits great. It has a lot of storage room , which help organize all of my craft supplies."
20275885,Really happy with this. I love this shelf unit. It was easy to put together and so versatile. I plan to buy another one!
40415601,"Looks great!. Bought this for my daughters montessori play area. It’s great. Easy to assemble, and I love the look. As she ages we plan on adding drawers and doors."
80275887,"Much harder to put together than I thought. I've put a lot of Ikea furniture together over the years. This Kallax 2 X 4 unit was probably the most difficult piece I've had to do. Granted, the instructions call for 2 people and I did it by myself, but the main problem was the wooden dowels were too big for the holes and it was incredibly hard to get the pieces to go together. Also, the MDF in this piece seems more fragile than usual, and pieces of it crumbled off while I was working on it. And the directions for attaching the caster wheels are incomprehensible and contain incorrect information. I had to watch a YouTube video to figure out what to do. Now that the piece is together I love it. But I would not buy another one because of how unpleasant the assembly was. On a positive note, I also bought the Kallax 1 X 4 and that was a breeze to assemble. I'll buy more of those!"
50339292,"Great Quality, VERY Happy. I purchase this piece about a month ago, and I am a very happy customer! If this would fit in with the look of your home/apartment, then I would recommend you buy it. Great quality, visually appealing, all around happy customer"
20275814,what’s not to love. Kallax/Expedit what’s not to love in any size or color. This is Number Four and won’t be the last one. The most versatile piece of furniture ever. We have bigger ones but needed a smaller one this time.
10305741,"Very sturdy shelf - repurchasing!. A year ago, I helped pick out this shelf for my roommate to purchase for our living room. It functions very well as a TV stand. We purchased the dröna boxes to go in the bottom 4 spaces. We use the top 4 spaces for our electronics like the wifi router and Apple TV. The shelf is of surprisingly good quality and much sturdier than I expected. Assembling took two people and about 15 minutes. Now that I'm moving, I'm buying the same unit to use at my new apartment. I offered to buy the existing unit from my roommate but they also really loved it and are taking it to their new place. Both of us clearly loved this shelf, so I expect most people would, too."
60275812,meh. cheap nails strip so you're lucky if you can get them all the way in. peg holes are too small so you have to figure out which ones to hammer in and which ones to leave open. poor product assembly experience. boo.
00275848,Fits Just Right. It fit just right in my closet for the space I needed
20275814,LOVE these for our home office!. Love these for our home office!
00334536,"Worst IKEA project ever!. I’ve purchased too many IKEA projects to count, some of them much more complicated than the EKET cabinet. This should have been a straight forward assembly, but it wasn’t because the hardware was out of true, the panels would never line up correctly and, in the end, it wasn’t stable enough to use for anything."
20275885,"So in love with these!. I have 3 of these in my home now. They are so sturdy and I love the insert options for them. I use them to store craft stuff in my sewing room and in my bedroom I have one for bathroom storage and one for general storage. My bathroom is so small and has no storage so I set this up just out side the door and it holds all my towels, makeup, hair stuff, and all manner of girly products. This only takes about 30-40 min. to put together but you really should have 2 people. If you push to hard without someone pushing back you could break it."
20275885,Very Flexible. Very convenience and flexible. Can easier be moved anywhere. Can be used for sideway or upright. Solid and kids friendly.
30275861,Exactly what I wanted. Easy to put together perfect for my sewing room
80275887,Love it. I bought one and bought a second one
30275861,fits perfectly. It's working great and serving the purpose we bought it for
30275861,"Multi functional shelves. Bought for kids toys and crafts. Liked so much, we replaced the dressers in my kids’ rooms with these. There is so much more space in the drawers and less space taking up in their small rooms. Wish I would’ve known about these years ago!"
20275885,Built very well. It works perfect for our bar area and holds wine bottles
20275885,LOVE this unit!. Put this in our rec room to make an L with another we purchased last yr Love how oi t looks and holds many books and.collectibles.
20213312,So long to put together!!. I really think this piece is beautiful but in good old Ikea fashion it was missing pieces and it was defective but the piece that was defective was on the 2 to last step so I would have never noticed it. It too filing and some hammer to get off the extra weld that was on said part and it took me several hours to put together. Mind you I am only one person so a second pair of hands would have been helpful. Also if i had all the parts (not needing to do surgery or go to the hardware store) it may have taken and hour or 2 to put together. I gave it four stars because of the price and the look. But beware my fellow Ikea shoppers give yourself some time
20275885,Versatile. We bought the shelf about one month ago to use as our tv stand and shelving system in the living room. It was easy to assemble and has been a very useful addition for us. Versatile!
20275814,Not the same size as previous shelving.. Very disappointed that these are not the same size as previous version. I bought them to match up to the Kallax shelving I already had and there is a 1 difference.
40275846,So versatile!. I have bought several of these shelves and they never disappoint!
80275887,Practical and beautiful. Easy to put together and very functional. Simple and great
20275885,"It holds things.. If you want to have your things off the ground, then that Kallax certainly does the job."
90286649,"Great drawer...but small. This accessory for the KALLAX is okay. It’s more difficult to assemble than I thought and you have to drill it into the main unit. So make sure you’re sure on where you want it.  The drawers work well and very smooth to open and close, but very small.  I like the wire basket and shorter under basket for more storage.  It is a nice accessory if it works for you."
00275848,"Great product, but..... Product is great as long as you don’t hang it floating on the wall. The instructions show the product can be hung on the wall floating but they don’t provide the size screws that are needed. My unit fell twice."
20409936,Perfect size. It's exactly what I wanted and I'm going to buy 2 more as soon as I have the chance.
40415601,"Sturdy storage. This shelf happens to be one of my favorite IKEA pieces. I was originally going to buy the 16 slot shelf, however it was out of stock so I went with the nine slot shelf. The shelf is very sturdy, strong, and keeps all of my children’s books, DVDs, and personal train gets in an organized manner."
40275846,Love the Kallax shelf units but..... I was adding to a 4x4 shelf unit that I got a few years ago. I was disappointed that they were not the same size. The new one is shorter.
20275814,Sturdy bookcase - for my cats!. I have four cats and wanted something for them to climb on and curl up in. Put a bed in each “cube” and they love it. Would be a great bookcase/ shelving unit too - which is what it’s designed for!
10305802,We made it into a pantry!. Bought this for my adult daughters apartment and made it her pantry. It beautiful and works great. We got all matching IKEA Variera glossy white bins and the foodstuffs go inside. Beautiful. Organized. Modern. LOVE IT!
99017445,"Great Versatile Cabinet. This works great for so many things, easy to build, looks great and works even better. Added 4 of the drawers and one more door to suit my needs"
70301537,Perfect for that Yarn Stash!. Very easy to assemble and looks great in my craft room.
90305803,"Slim and space saving. Love the slim table, using it for my computer and work space, just wish that it had some sort of cord management system to hide the cords."
20275885,"The kallax looks great great. The kallax looks great great in my closet, it’s very Sturdy and makes my closet look more organized."
10275862,"Great item. We bought it, for room divider and it is amazing. , We don't have chindren in our house. Easy to assemble"
20275885,Great storage!. Very needed in kid's playroom!
10305741,"Great shelf unit, but wall anchor system is poor!. Assembly of the shelf unit was easy. The unit is quality. However, we use it in vertical mode. This requires wall anchoring. The provided anchor system does not reach the wall. The designers have not accounted for floor molding. The anchors need to have adjustable positions so the anchor can be attached to the wall. As is you probably will have to design your own adapter blocks to attach to the wall. Looks like IKEA has not learned from their tip over problems."
20275814,Sturdy cube. Really sturdy and easy to clean. Easy to assembly.
90286649,"Great fit and looks nice. I purchased the drawers for use in my craft room. I have both IKEA shelving as well as some I purchased elsewhere. The cubes fit fine in either. Gives my shelving a finished look. Wouldn’t want to put really heavy materials, but sturdy enough for printer paper, etc."
70342199,"Perfect size. I own 2 of the larger versions of this product. This one fit in a small space perfectly. Sturdy, great looking. Would look great in any room"
19278328,. This is by far the easiest thing I’ve ever put together and I did it all by myself!!
20275885,"Good, quality shelf. We have now purchased 3 of these units. They are built well and serve the purposes they were need for."
70339291,"Looks great, sturdy, lots of shelf space. Lovely open shelving brought affordable style and storage to my small kitchen. On brand for Ikea and a good purchase."
30275861,Always a favorite. We have so many of these Kallax pieces in our home. Great for storage.
20275814,"Great for small space. Love the shelf unit. Easy to put together, and it fit well in a small space I had. You could easily get two of these and stack them on top of each other and attach them to the wall."
80275887,"Great for tall items!. I bought two of these. The first one went together easily, the second was a bit trickier as the holes for the wooden pegs were tight and I broke 2 pegs (had just enough with both bookcases) Love the storage as I have many books too large to fit into regular bookshelves and will buy more."
80275887,"Perfect Laying Horizontally. Turned horizontally, this is PERFECT for our small TV and laptop used in our exercise room. Not too wide, taller than a TV table, long enough to hold everything, lots of storage...this is just what we needed without spending a fortune. Thanks, IKEA!"
50214678,I just love it!. Has to buy three...one for each room. I just love it. So much stuff fits on them and it makes it look nice and organized. Took about 15-20 to assemble.
00415599,"Holds a lot!. Using this with matching bins for extra storage space. It's clean, simple & the perfect height to set framed photos or a Smart TV."
50339292,"Useful modern, industrial look. It served its purpose as a monitor stand. Went together easily and fits with the modern, industrial decor in a mountain house home theater"
20275885,"Solid Piece. We bought this piece for our downstairs playroom and went back and bought a second one for our daughters room. This piece is solid construction, easy to assemble and comes with wall anchors. Great addition to any room!"
10305741,"Versatile and functional. Using this in the garage for sports equipment, outdoor supplies, etc. Bought the cheap black nylon cubes to hold tennis balls, shoes, etc. Love that they have options on cubes.  We'll see how the quality stands up in Texas heat."
60333954,"Great Flexible Storage. I bought this for storage in my guest room used mainly by my young grandchildren. The room is tiny. The scale is perfect and it is sturdy and attractive. Assembly was relatively simple, but not quite as easy as the video made it seem. It needed a bit more strength to push some pieces into the final 1/4” of alignment than I had, but my husband got everything to pop into place just right. Great quality for the price."
20213312,"Love these shelves!. These shelves are really great, my husband and I are both very impressed with the quality and design. They took about 30 minutes to put together but the directions were clear and we didn't have any oopsies during the process. Considering buying a second set for another room!"
00275848,Excellent toy or utility storage. Excellent toy or utility storage
80275887,"Functional, Decorative and Great for Storage. I have two of these shelves in my home office and love them. I have them next to each other, one upright and the other sideways. I bought various baskets to fit the compartments and all my stuff/junk/treasures are under wraps. Very sturdy, too!"
20409936,"great product and price. looks great, works well easy to put together and one of the staples of IKEA - must have for the kids room!"
00275848,simple but perfect. Works perfectly for what I got it for. Laid on it side it makes a perfect blanket storage bench
10275862,Sturdy and Stylish Storage. Bought this for my office/crafts room. It fits my scrapbooking supplies and other items perfectly. Turned cluttered space into beautiful storage. I assembled and moved it into the room myself (petite female). Added magazine storage boxes and a few fabric drawers to corral things. It's perfect! I absolutely love it!
20275885,. Great shelving unit. Has held up well. Good value. Very easy to assemble
80275887,". Love it .cute stylish, elegant,"
00314642,"Poor fit but doable. The drawers are a great concept but don’t deliver on the fit. We had to fiddle around with the sides and screws to adjust them to line up properly. After several attempts we got a finished product that was acceptable but not perfect. If precision is important to you, take a pass."
20275885,"Sleek and stylish. This shelf was meant to add storage and function to my son's apartment. It went far beyond. It looks so sleek and stylish, as well it keeps his home organized and tidy."
20275885,"TV Center Console. I bought this KALLAX item as a TV center console. I also bought 8 DRÖNA boxes as inserts. Keeps items clean and in their place. Video games in one, movies in the other, books, photo albums, board games, etc. Love this item!"
50339292,"Industrial design at Ikea. If you like industrial look this is a great item, it was very easy to assemble, (just make sure the to pay attention to have all the pieces facing the same side) It's also a very sturdy piece, I am storing all my sewing machines, which are pretty heavy. Best part the price! :)"
50305739,High quality!. I used it in my walk in closet for my shoes and it fit perfect and the quality was perfect!
80275887,"For 7 yr old room. Bought it for toys, books, etc so 7 year old can organize and reach her stuff.  Great versatility and can add drawers.  Moderate weight. Not too heavy and not light. Highly recommend bolting to wall as it is not 100% stable on plush carpet."
19931865,Love my shelf with drawers!. Bought this but wasn’t too sure about the openness of it. I ended up loving it!
00415599,It really suits my needs for organizing.. I am having a problem getting an insert I need. Not available at the store.
70301542,". great, i love it.!!!!!!!!"
20213312,Perfect display unit. I bought this for my husband to display some of the trains in his collection and it works perfectly. Assembly was fairly easy too!
60275812,Great storage!. I bought this unit to put some organization in my kids playroom. It was very easy to put together and it's nice and sturdy. I also bought the bins and I was able to fit some many toys in there. Definitely would recommend this unit!
20213312,"good shelves, but assembly is not great. top and bottom shelves come with screws that do not have holes for them, so you have to screw them on new wood and they don't go in easily at all. We just left the top and bottom shelves without screws because we couldn't"
60275812,"Exactly what it's supposed to be. We have seven of these in various configurations, one with castors; we gave two away to our daughter-in-law for her home office; one interesting feature is that the compartment is big enough for vinyl records, unlike some of the competition."
80303437,"Functional + Classy. Accompanied with Ikea's DRÖNA box and VARIERA shelf inserts. Works well for my bedroom needs and provides a classy look. My boyfriend assembled it quickly. Make sure when positioning shelves to note the space between the outer bars and the shelf; it's easy to not center the shelves properly. That's probably why I have space to hang a hook, because he allowed too much space on one side."
80275887,"Functional, sleek, and simple.. A little bit tedious to put together, but it wasn't too bad. The KALLAX is a functional and classic piece of IKEA furniture. I have a few of them in various rooms of our home."
20275814,Love the storage space. I brought this item a month ago. It is very strong and sturdy. Love how it can get some books and decorations.
60275812,"Awful. So disappointed with the quality. Have same unit from 10 years ago, strong, heavy and sturdy. Took this out of the box and was thin, peeling apart and cheap. Not the IKEA I used to know. Size is an inch smaller. Not consistent with what is used to be in the past."
80275887,"Terrible delivery service. This isn’t a dig against the product, which overall is great. But rather an expression of my extreme disappointment in IKEA’s delivery methods and customer service. It took well over a month to have a shelf unit delivered to my house after serval terminal delays and the fact the delivery company forgot to load my order onto a truck several times. Both IKEA and the delivery company were indifferent and unwilling to help. I guess all I can say is buy this item in store if you’re serious about owning it in a reasonable timeframe."
90286649,"Love the little drawers!. These are great drawers, however, I would request IKEA to make the sides and back of these drawers taller so one could fit About 2x more into the drawers. And I still Love venthem! lo love them!"
60275812,Awesome flexibility. I originally bought two of the Kallax 2x2 as night stands and they work great. I then bought two of the 1x4 and stacked them horizontally as a sideboard and it works great. I also three 2x2 units to serve as an entertainment center and the possibilities are endless. I want to get four 2z2 units to serve as a room divider. See.a pattern here?
70342199,Awesome for homeschooling. We got two of these to go with our other FJÄLLBO unit in our breakfast nook- our school supplies fit perfectly and I love the look!
70301542,"Great Shelf Unit. I love this product, it is a great addition to the room I put it in."
20275885,"Perfect for the space, and like oks very nice as e. I am happy with this product even after a month!"
60275812,Looks good but materials lacking. I bought this a month ago for my daughter's dorm room. The laminate peeled on several corners of the shelves when we were assembling. One of the corner holes was not drilled out properly so when the screw went in it pushed material up and created a bubble under the laminate. It would have broken through and created a hole had I not caught it. I was able to turn the shelf so the bubble and peeling laminate are not visible from the front but we know it's there. The materials used to make the shelf seemed a little lacking.
20275885,Looks awesome. Very happy with it. Easy to put together and looks very nice.
80275887,Love it. We actually bought this as a TV stand and we love it a lot cheaper than a traditional TV stand
70342199,"Great shelf unit. I am a sewer/quilter and have several machines. I needed something to store them on. I originally was going to get a table, but I saw this in the store and thought it was perfect for my needs. I have three machines stored on this shelving unit and it looks awesome!!! Love it!"
80275887,"Wonderful shelf. After we got home my husband assembled it in no time. This shelf is a wonderful , the openings are perfect to add boxes or baskets . I just Love this shelf unit, it is well made."
40303439,". I bought one, really liked it and bought another"
20278167,Perfect fit. Perfect fit. Great closed storage option for my shelving unit.
70342199,"Industrial look. Love this shelf unit, it’s very sturdy and I have gotten a lot of compliments on it. I got it to put my plants on it."
40303439,Modern display. This shelving unit looks amazing in our home. It’s narrow depth and height made the room feel less cluttered and the glass allows the light to flatter all the nic nacs on display.
80275887,"Excellent quality shelf. This is my second purchase of the Kallax shelf unit. Very sturdy, versatile piece of furniture. Easy to assemble."
20275814,Versatile piece. I bought this as a tv console for a very small sitting room. Fits space well
90286649,Awesome. Very easy to install and looks great
70332124,. I appreciate this design. I use the modules to create my entire office. could you make a nice glass door for the cube? that would keep the dust off mu books. thanks
50305739,"Love them!. We have an office full of these! We bought the cubbies to go in them and everyone loves not only how they look, but how sturdy and useful they are. Note: 20-minute set-up; really well made."
70301537,"Great addition. I purchased this for my craft room, and it’s great! Easy to assemble with two people. Cubby holes are nice and deep. Just FYI, the Drona inserts are flimsy and the rattan options don’t truly fit to maximize space, so I bought Better Homes & Gardens inserts that fit perfectly and offer a wide variety of color choices."
40303439,I love how light and airy it is!. I bought this as a room divider/ plant shelf. Because of the glass and thin frame it creates a very light feeling. Creates privacy without feeling enclosed. Reasonably easy to assemble.
40415601,GREAT SPACE SAVER. I BOUGHT THIS AND I LOVE HOW LOVELY & DIFFERENT MY LIVING SPACE LOOKS
20275885,"Nice design. Hit or miss with quality.. The first Kalisz I bought was wonderful. I went back to buy a second one, and this one is warped and when you tap on the board, you can hear it is very hollow in spots. Placing objects on it causes cracks. So, quality is hit or miss."
10305741,Love the High Gloss finish!. I bought this a month ago to store fabric in my Craft Studio. It took me about 40 minutes to assemble- all the parts were there and it seems really strong.
60275812,"Great piece of furniture. We wanted a storage unit to put the TV on, but didn't want the expense of an entertainment unit. This works perfectly."
70301542,"Tons of space for storage. Awesome price, tons of room for storage highly recommend."
70301537,Makes the room look organized. Makes the room look organized
00275848,"Perfect Addition for home. Purchased these about 2 weeks ago, they’ve created great storage and functionality to my bedroom. The KALLAX products have been the best versatile home storage design to compliment any style of decor."
10345073,Should have paid more attention. I bought this to hang from the top of my 2x2 Kallax with doors on the bottom. I didn't pay attention to the fact that it will only hang from the narrow middle ledge. They're beautiful and I wish they would have worked!
90286649,. I have 12 of them and they are great.
80275887,Easy assembly. Will use it inside a closet to organize craft materials. Very well finished and should not snag stored items. Easily moved after assembly.
50305739,"Easy to assemble. I bought two units to stack. They provide extra storage for tees, tanks, sweatshirts and hoodies in our upstairs bedroom."
20275885,Perfect for organizing any space.. Perfect for organizing any space. Large deep shelves for lots of items. We already have two!
30275861,Very sturdy for the price. Very substantial - very pleased with value! Easy to put together!
20275885,. I use this shelf in my living room as a behind the couch table (obviously it is positioned laying on its long side. Perfect size and perfect price. I assembled easily (70 year old woman). Added some basket for hidden storage.
20275814,Must have item. Kallax is a must have item in every house. Has so many to offer with just a little touch of creativity for your needs in decoration.
00415599,"Great for random storage in a small space. I bought this unit to tuck into a small wall in my sewing room. It's perfect to hold my notions and equipment without taking up too much room. My only wish is that it was taller -- maybe a 5x3 squares version. I know I can add a 2x3 piece on top, but I'm not loving the idea of the double-thick edge that would give me."
89275091,"Solid construction but white is easily scuffed. I bought six of these several months ago for use in my home office. They are solidly built and were easy to assemble (though a power drill/driver is helpful, as is a second person to help manipulate some of the larger pieces). It was relatively straightforward to get multiple units aligned so that they are all the same height, and look coordinated.  Yet, after a few months of use, the white surface has become scuffed from use. In general, the matte wood surfaces are difficult to clean, as it is not perfectly smooth and absorbs cleaning spray (so dusting with a damp cloth doesn't work well). I've been unable to get the scuffs off (they come from books being used, staplers and other office stuff being shifted around - so produced from just mild usage). So, I'm expecting to paint these within a year of purchase to freshen them up (and seal the surface for easier cleaning!)."
20275885,Great storage!. I bought this unit to put some organization in my kids playroom. It was very easy to put together and it's nice and sturdy. I also bought the bins and I was able to fit some many toys in there. Definitely would recommend this unit!
10275862,Very sturdy. This is a nice organizer. It not too hard to assemble and seems very sturdy.
40275846,It matched perfectly with our wall unit.. I bought this to go with our wall unit we also bought from IKEA.
50339292,"A Cool Design. I love the design, colors, and size of the piece. Assembly wasn't hard. I used an electric drill to very carefully pre-drill the holes for the many screws attaching the two wood shelves to the frame. I was surprised that screw holes weren't already pre-drilled. It would have been a challenge for me to get the screws in straight without pre-drilling. I was disappointed that the lower metal shelf bowed when I put a box filled with scrapbooking paper and supplies on it. I'd thought the metal shelf would be stronger. I took several things out of the box and stored them elsewhere, so I wouldn't permanently bow the shelf."
10275862,Shelf unit for child's room. I really am impressed with this unit - the quality is great and it looks wonderful in my grandson's bedroom.  It works great as an organizer and he now has unlimited closet space where his toys were previously kept.
40346924,. My husband uses this for his ever expanding record collection and he loves it!
10305802,"shelf. nice looking, good quality"
70286645,Awesome option for organized closed storage. Easy to assemble. Looks great and works so well.
80275887,"Great. These shelves are perfect for everything. They are sturdy and look great. I bought another shelf to put right next to a shelf I bought exactly a year ago. The shelves are the exact same size, color, and finish, but the new shelf's color is more off white than my older shelf. It's just a small difference in color, but a little annoying that the color changed from last year."
70342199,Nice industrial look. I use this in my bathroom as a display storage unit. The assembly was easy with it taking about 20-30 minutes.
10275862,"great space saver. Excellent storage space for my CD, DVD and book collections."
40275846,Easy Build! Looks Great!. Got this to fill out my entertainment center - I like the open back and the simplicity of the design - one of the easier IKEA builds. Looks a lot better than the cheap cube storage systems you can get at other big box retailers.
90286649,Super easy set up!. I bought this to go in my KALLAX Shelf unit and it was so easy to install. I am so happy with it!
60275812,Perfect size and shape. Kallax units are great for storage and they look wonderful
70301537,Sturdy. Sturdy. Easy to assemble. Allows for many storage options
70342199,Sturdy shelving unit. Very good for the price. Works perfectly in space. Was easy to assemble
80275887,Great storage system. Always a favorite. Very versatile. Many size options.
80275887,Easy to assemble. I bought this to use as a dresser for a child. Works very well and I was able to build it on my own and I’m not very handy so that’s a plus.
40275846,Great product with easy to follow instructions!. My husband was able to easily follow the instructions on installing the shelf unit. Also looks great! Very happy with it and will consider buying more in the future.
20275814,Easy to assemble. I bought 2 of these to use in my sewing room. They're easy to put together with only  a screwdriver. They're sturdy and look good. Perfect for my needs.
60275812,". Sturdy, very nice looking. It was the second one I bought.  Both look perfect together"
60275812,"Nice unit. I love the product but having problems assembling since I don't have anyone that can help. Surprise, I need more dow pins, how can I get them. I have bought 3 kinds at hardware store and they are too big."
90305803,. My daughter wanted it for her room and it looks great. So i got it for her for Christmas.
80275887,Craft room. Able to organize my room
60275812,Perfect for what I needed. I bought this with a couple of baskets that fit right inside and it is the perfect storage piece for my exercise room.
70339291,Sharp looking. Easy to put together. Holds a lot of items in a small space. Very class looking.
20275885,"Great product. This is an outstanding product I have used them to create a bed, a room divider, an organizer for toys, and oh yes, a book shelf. Easily one of the most useful pieces available on the market and super affordable."
50339292,"Worked for my office storage purposes.. I needed a way to organize my home based office, I purchased 2, and they fit the scheme and purpose perfectly. Easy to assemble as well."
20275885,Amazing. I bought for my living room and look great.
60275812,Heavy for the wall. Great floor shelf but kinda Harvey for a wall and then you add dishes and it’s even heavier
90286649,Provides a stylish option for our much loved shelf. These drawers give us great options for storage for our much loved shelving unit. We have the older Expedit and they still fit great. These are a little tricky to install perfectly but overall the look is sleek and functional.
20275885,Looks Great. I bought this for my son's room. Very easy to put together and the spaces are large enough to put baskets. It looks so good that we purchased other matching pieces for my son's room.
60278170,Love. So easy to assemble and looks great
70301537,Great unit. This unit has so much storage capacity. It’s a sturdy unit and easy to assemble
10275862,"Great piece for my office. I absolutely love this piece in my office, bought some cubes, the door inserts and the pet cube also. It is perfect"
80275887,Nice Organizer. I bought this a month ago and returned for it was too large for my space! My bad! Going back for six bin! I got the fabric bins so can’t wait to organize grandchildren’s toys!
79278269,. very good item.. the best for the money
20213312,Great for Indoor Plants!. LOVE this shelf. All of my plants fit perfectly on it and it looks great! Everyone that comes to my apartment compliments this shelf. The glass in it gives it a more open feel for my small space. It's also a lot more sturdy than other shelves I have bought from IKEA in the past.
20275814,"it has been out of stock for more than 9 weeks!!!!. I like the color and quality for the price the reason why I give only 2 stars is: I bought this kallax shelf unit in walnut gray effect color I could purchase 1 because they did not have more at that time in Sunrise FL, so I was like no problem I will buy the rest and I will finish my bedroom set in 1-2-3 weeks when they will have it in stock again. well I am still waiting it has been like that for more than 9 weeks now. I am actually really considering to return my self unit and buy my bedroom set from another store. it is ridiculous. I check the store availability in every 4 days. I was planning to order the rest 2 units online but they charged 110 dollars for delivery and they do not have a local pick up option if I order it. I called them and of course they do not know when they will have it again in stock. such a shame! please fix the problem."
60275812,"So many uses!. We have several of these units in our son's room, and they serve many purposes--Lego table, bookcase, board game holder, closet organizer. A sturdy and wonderful asset to any room!"
80275887,"A classic!. Very easy to assemble, sturdy and functional."
10409932,"Fits all kinds of things!. Used with basket drawers and without. Also, stores LP’s/records very well."
20275814,"Poor construction. Several dowel pegs snapped during assembly. You can't order spare parts from IKEA; I found some at a hardware store. One side had misdrilled holes, so the top piece is not sturdy in place. 0/10 would not buy again."
20275885,"Great buy and Value!!!!. Purchased this to suit my new 65” TV and it’s perfect it was a hard choice ,IKEA had many different options for TV’S glad I chose this one because it allowed me to display numerous animal sculptures and DVD’s yes DVD’s in this age of streaming Great buy and value!!!!"
80275887,"Solid Piece. We set this up and threw some small slanted legs we found online to the bottom and it looks fantastic! Perfect organization for our kids toys. I would give 5 stars, but when it's set up horizontally you can see the bolts on the sides. Provider some sort of little cover for that bolt to make it all clean and white would make it more ideally aesthetic."
00314642,"Good if you need drawers, but flimsy sides. We purchased the previous version of these drawers which had full board sides. These drawers have flimsy paste board sides with roller rails pop riveted to the paste board sides. This is a major down grade of these drawers. Seems obvious that this was a cost reduction move. I can only hope that these will have a long life."
50339292,Awesome for homeschooling!. We got this unit to put in our breakfast nook to organize our homeschooling supplies and books. I love that our kitchen doesn’t look like school has taken over and all of our stuff is neatly organized!
20275885,"simply the best. Could not ask for a better unit at any price. Sturdy, attractive and well made. If you need one this is it"
40275846,Perfect TV Stand. I turned this on it's side and added the Capita legs to make a fantastic TV stand. It holds two gaming consoles and controllers plus my small vinyl collection in the cubbies and plenty of room on top for my television and speakers. Very easy assembly!
70301542,Perfect. There cube shelves are perfect for storing my fabric
60275812,Putting it together alone was. Putting it together alone was a bit challenging  Some of the wooden dowels broke off It would have been easier with two people
00415599,Good storage. Happy with this unit. Lots of storage
50339292,Pefect fit for kitchen. Very pleased with the storage for our kitchen.
70342199,"Great purchase. This was easy to assemble, sturdy and looks great."
80275887,"Excellent piece - good value !!. We originally were going to purchase a built in storage unit - looked at this and decided to go with the IKEA Kallax system - we have been very happy with the look and design, great unit and value!!"
10305741,"Perfect all around.. Love it. Always wanted one in lacquer white and now that i got one, i will be buying different styles and combinations. Fits everywhere horizontally, vertically and works as a room divider. Infinite ways to organize, store and display things. I use it as my tv stand and it fits all consoles as well. Love it."
10305741,"storage. This was a great addition to our hom, it's discrete, but holds a lot of stuff"
20275814,Awesome storage. I bought this a month ago to complete my storage issue in my walk in closet. They work out great. I have 9ft ceilings so I bought 3 of them and stack them up to the ceiling. Great storage!
10345073,Quick shelve. Great quick shelve for the Kallax system. Keep in mind that if you use doors or drawers above the cubicle you want to use it will not work. Fits a check box which is exactly what I needed.
70301537,"Easy to assemble and looks great. I have two of these units in my house now - 1 that separates my living room from my office, and one in my craft room to organize all of my supplies. I love the versatility to add drawers, doors, shelves, and cubes. This is a large unit that I haven't been able to find anywhere else. I have found smaller ones that cost almost the same and are not as sturdy as this unit is."
40275846,Awesome storage. I bought this for my grand-niece and am happy I did. She stores all her little toys in it and it is easy for her to get the storage boxes out.
20275885,"Does as planned. Solid, sturdy and looks good for the role I had in mind."
70301537,"Third one we have bought . Bigger and better!. This unit holds all the stuff my husband had accumulated in his office.Backpacks,books shoes,office supplies and much more..And the bins can hide it all."
10275862,"Absolutely the perfect shelf for records. The Kallax system replaced the Expedit system a few years back and has become the workhorse storage system for record collectors around the world. And for good reason: the shelves cubicles are the perfect size, it is sturdy and inexpensive. Every time I run out of record storage space I run over to IKEA and buy another Kallax shelf unit."
00275848,"easy to build, functional, and nice looking. Love this. Currently have it laying sideways with baskets for the kids toys. Looks great! Super affordable and easy to put together!"
20275885,Perfect for our needs. This shelving unit is perfect for our needs. We lay it sideways behind the sofa to store music books and curriculum. The each child's bedroom has one for books and toys. Easy and quick to assemble. Attractive. Great price!
20275885,"Multi-room problem solver. We use a white one horizontally in the kitchen to store appliances, etc., added the Linnmon top for countertop. Have two ebony ones horizontally in the living room for TV and media storage, one horizontally in nursery for all baby-stuff. Have used baskets so far, but looking into the additional drawer and door inserts. Even saw blonde wood one being used in an office setting on an Australian TV show. Thinking about getting the double unit as a mudroom/entryway organizer. Added chicken wire on the back so stuff doesn’t slide through, yet can use wall plugs. Looks great everywhere. Wish they had the blonde wood available in USA."
10345073,"Cute addition to KALLAX. Looks really nice on the dark wood KALLAX, but I wouldn't overload it with heavy magazines."
00275848,Product as described and useful. Product as described and useful in my space. Just what I needed.
20275885,Awesome. So got this for my husband's record collection and it's Awsome.
20275814,Perfect Size for Closet Storage. I bought this in the as-is clearance section and it was already assembled. It was a great deal and it fits perfectly for storage in my closet! I love it! Highly recommend any of the Kallax shelf units!
80275887,Perfect!. Luv this price. I have it turned on it’s side and used it for a tv stand/ dresser for guests
40275846,Well made. So easy to put together and is solidly constructed.
40415601,"Great addition to a Studio apartment. I bought this in mind to separate from the living area to my bed area since my Studio is an open floor plan. It is the perfect size for storage without being an eye sore in my apartment, the 4x4 was HUGE. I can mix and match what I store in each of the shelves with IKEA's varying options of shelving inserts.  I would say that some of my hammering during construction caused some bends in the wood, but it's not as noticeable with the dark color."
70286645,"Looks nice. I got about 3 sets of these drawers to go in 3 shelf units. They are nice and look good. Only drawback is that they are on the smaller size inside, so they don't hold as much as they look on the outside. I like the doors better. We decided to keep them anyway."
20275885,Perfect addition. Easy to assemble. Looks great.
20278167,Great for the shelf unit. We bought about 6 of these to put in 3 shelf units. Very nice looking and helps hide some items on the shelf.
19278253,Looks great!. We are getting so many great compliments about this unit. We put the doors on the top. It was also easy to put together.
70342199,"Great storage, sturdy and flexible. Bought 4 of these shelves to use in resetting home office after I retired. These are perfect for stacking shoebox storage pieces, electronics, toys, and relatively heavy items. They are easy to assemble and the ability to adjust the feet to level shelves is perfect for carpet or wiggly flooring."
00275848,"Perfect height. I love the size of this product, especially it's height. I had no difficulty assembling it myself, and moving it was a breeze! And the interior dimensions didn't change-I can use the same boxes as I did with my Expedit products!"
90305803,Great Table. The table looks modern and compliments my room. Only thing I don't care for is the glass shelf holds dust. It was easy to assemble which is a plus.
10275862,Good looking and fun to put together. My husband and son put this shelving unit together in no time and it looks great. The whole thing was well designed!
20213312,"Nice looking shelf!. I bought this for a particular spot in my living room and this shelf is perfect! I love the simple lines, the height and width are just right. The price was very reasonable and it was super-easy to put together and I also bolted it to the wall for safety. My record album collection and books look so nice on this shelf."
80275887,Great Unit. We purchased 3 of these to make a wall unit in our exercise room. 2 standing up and 1 laying.  We put a few doors and drawers in there also. Looks so nice and am able to store a lot in them.
20275814,Great value for price. Really happy with the quality. Shelves are sturdy enough to withstand my two little ones. Only complaint is that is doesn't come with those little plastic screw covers- with a white bookcase I dislike seeing the silver screw heads.
20278167,"Origami construction. I love the Kallax system but despise the origami structure of this. The old ones were sturdy, this however you have to drill into the cabinet, making it impossible to change the location of the doors. The walls are flimsy and the back looks not that good."
70286645,"Quick to assemble, smooth operation. The drawers were nice and quick to assemble (I bought a bunch and did them assembly-line style and they were done in no time!) The bottom of the drawer slides around a bit while you're trying to hammer the plastic bolts into place - a clamp fixed that and actually helped the hammering go faster, too. Screwing it into the Kallax by hand takes a fair bit of oomph - we were doing five of them and by the end both of us were having a lot of trouble turning the screwdriver anymore. An electric driver might be a good idea, if you can get it in there. I liked that guides were included to make sure you got everything to just the right depth and all - I feel like it would have been easy to overlook the detail and make the user deal with it themselves, but they went that extra mile and it looks great. The drawers themselves move perfectly smoothly, and I feel like they also lent a little extra structural stability to the Kallax unit."
80334603,"Tricky to put together but easy if you do it right. I bought 5 of them, I took each piece out of the box and assembled them as they came out, the first one went together with no problem. I put the next 2 together in the same order as the first but could not get either one to fit together.  I discovered the problem that a lot of people have had. The pieces are placed in some but not all of the boxes in assembly order. You must start with piece #1 and put the proper 2nd and 3rd piece on each side of it.  When you are doing the 3rd side it is very easy to put the wrong piece on, If you do the final side won't fit.  The problem is that piece # 1 has a deeper slot for the back to fit into. If you assemble # 3 wrong #1 will be on the side, not the back. This will cause the back piece to block the final side from sliding into the holes. After discovering this the next 4 went together in less than 2 minutes each."
40415601,Great look!. SO happy I bought this to store home schooling materials. The fabric boxes hold a ton and it all looks terrific. (Yay- no more piles of stuff laying around!)
20275885,Easy to assemble!. We bought the 8 and 4 shelf units and stacked them next to a 4 shelf unit that we already had. Works great and looks great! Very happy!
60278170,Good value. Considering the materials this was surprisingly solid once installed. Also very easy to assemble and install.
20275814,I just love these cubes!. I just love these cubes! I’ve purchased so many of them that they are my go to item for organization. The quality is so much better than the ones you can get at other stores.
40275846,"Sturdy and good looking. NOT your cheap construction. The reason it got lower points was it was missing half the pegs. We had to get pegs to finish. NOT GOOD. I recommend, but be rady to go out and buy missing parts."
20275885,Well designed and built. As a woodworker I am always pleased with the design of IKEA products and how easy they are to put together. All the holes line up!
60333954,Perfecto. My daughter wanted a shelf like this and found this very much to her liking. Thank you!!
10409932,". So i had bought this one, and only recieved half the shelving? Is there two parts we are suppose to buy? Like i didnt have enough dividers nor a top piece."
20278167,Great inexpensive product!. Great inexpensive product!
99017445,". Bought this as a tv stand, it is perfect!"
40275846,"Wonderful storage. A shelf collapsed in my closet. Went right to IKEA. This item went together easily and stores tons of stuff. We also got the larger unit with 16 squares and put this one on top of it. SO MUCH STORAGE. Couldn't be happier! 20 squares altogether...some with cloth storage boxes, some open. amazing."
20275885,Great storage unit at a great price.. Sturdy shelving unit. Very affordable & easy to put together.
50214678,Perfect size!. We bought two of these to use at our camp. One on each side of the bed is perfect for holding a light on one shelf and clothes on the rest. They look great also! Exactly as I envisioned them to look!
20409936,We love it!. Great storage solution and with the combination of the cubes is awesome!
70301537,"Great-looking, versatile shelf system. We originally bought a 2x2 and 4x4 of the Kallax shelf units a few years ago, for our board game collection. In the intervening years, the collection grew and we decided to grab the 5x5. I've also been looking for a place to store all our art and craft supplies, and it dawned on me that one of these would be perfect for that too, so we got a second unit. The old one is now in an office closet, storing the various cords and other electronics and office things we had. The size of each cube is perfect - just large enough to fit everything in a category together, but providing both stability and separateness to bring everything together and make it feel organized. It really works well for all of the uses we put them to! As far as assembly, it came together pretty quickly but is definitely easier as a two-person job. The instructions want you to build it while it's upright, but we had a lot of difficulty getting the long shelves in sideways, so we built on its side to use our weight to help push the shelves down and in and then turned it onto its bottom when it was done. The first one did come out not quite plumb, perhaps, as a result, so do exercise caution if you go this route. We installed drawers across an entire row and that seemed to actually help straighten it out, so it didn't really make much difference. If you need to organize and store some stuff, you pretty much can't go wrong with these units!"
30275861,Very nice!. Just what I expected! Only reason I am leaving 4 stars instead of 5 is because a screw wouldn't go in right no matter what so it ended up being a little slanted. Other than that I love it!
60275812,Very flexible!. I have used these for years in both of my son's rooms and for the living room for almost everything. They work great with and without the baskets and doors. these are one of the best items from IKEA
10305741,"High gloss High quality. Very satisfied with this shelf. Love the high gloss, which elevates the look. Shelf is sturdy and does not wobble, even without mounting to wall. Instructions easy to follow. I purchased two and highly recommend."
10275862,"Great purchase, great value. Im very happy with the two Kallax units I bought; the six foot and the five foot. I like them so much I'm planning to buy two more smaller units."
00334536,"Pressure system is troublesome. This is the first IKEA furniture I had so much trouble putting together. The joints did not lineup correctly, I bought 2 and one of them the backboard was not correctly sized and I had to sand down to make it fit. I won't ever buy this item again, or anything with the same construction system."
30275861,Love it. Pretty easy to assemble.  Need to really concentrate on pictures to assemble.  Lots of storage room
50339292,Great for my turntable and record storage!!. I’ve been searching for a solution to my turntable/vinyl/audio debacle for a while now. Another reviewer said this was a great product for that! I house my turntable on top with my receiver and CD player on the middle shelf and my records fit perfect on the bottom shelf! Assembly was fairly easy and I love that it fits in with both my modern and antique furniture aesthetic.
20275814,Kallax shelf unit. 2nd one I have bought easy to put together
60275812,works as expected. it was easy to assemble and is practical for a student apartmenr
80275887,. I bought this a month ago & Happy I did. I use it as a tv stand it fits my tv with plenty of room for cable box blu Ray player & dvds blu rays & various things
20409936,"Kallax 3 X 4 square unit. Looks great and went together easily. My only issue is that it’s a little wobbly because if it’s size, but once in place, it’s stable."
70301537,"Perfect for Homeschooling. I bought this for my homeschooling materials/curriculum. It was easy to put together (I did it by myself) and looks great. It makes everything more organized and look a lot neater than how I had it before. I do wish it was a bit cheaper as I think it is a bit overpriced, but at the same time, I'm happy I spent the money - one of my favorite purchases."
70301537,Great style.. I bought this and was kinda nervous about the assembly. But it went together so well. I put it together by myself and only need help to put it into place in the room. I love the flexibility to make it my own. It holds so much. Mine is in a craft room and I able to bring all my supplies into one place but everything has its own spot. And I can see all my stuff.
80303437,"No top shelf?!. I bought this not realizing that the top section is open - no shelf! Why? It doesn't make sense. I would have happily paid a little more to have a top shelf at that opening. Also glad that the assembly instructions were online because mine were missing. When I opened the package, I thought I was missing a shelf...until I saw the assembly instructions."
10345073,"Great quality and design. I love the way this looks and the way it installs. Intuitive, sturdy, functional, and attractive!"
00275848,"Easy to assemble and love the versatility. I had two 4x2 Expedit before and love them. I just bought two of these 4x1 Kallax, and put one vertically and one horizontally, right next to each other for the kids to play or sit on top of them (Might not hold an adult weight). And I was able to reuse the Drona boxes that I originally purchased for the Expedit. I feel they are not as strong as the Expedit, but happy with the purchase so far, wish they were on sale though."
60275812,"Defective. The initial one I purchased had parts not drilled, returned and purchased a new one. All is good with the one with no defect, travel and lost day I will never get back."
90286649,excellent product.. Follow the instruction and assembly is not difficult.
20275885,Great. I have bought several of these which should tell everyone how much I love it.
60275812,"Very versatile. We have these units in our Florida home. Some have bins, some have drawers and some are empty/shelves. They work very well."
20278167,"Great add on to the Kallax system. Makes it easy to close off sets, fairly easy to install. Not as good as the old ones that were sturdier and had a good back, this one will look ugly from the back if you use it in Kallax not placed against the background."
60221683,"Strong - Well Made. After looking at many other options, I decided on this one. Am very glad I did! Seems well made & durable. It will be holding LOTS of cds & audio equipment."
70339291,Sturdy. Put A tv on it in my bed room. Works great. Very steady. I put together myself not to bad.
00314642,Good cost and quality. Liked the cost and quality of the drawers
10305741,. Love the piece I bought and it was very affordable.
50339292,"Looks good, but you get what you pay for. Looks good, seems sturdy, but you get what you pay for. Doors do not align. Issue is that the hinges included for the doors do not allow for alignment (round hole, not slot, as shown in the instruction booklet). Yes, shelf is leveled/squared, but one door attaches and hangs a full 1/4 lower on the frame than the other door, leaving a little space between the middle shelf and the top of the door. The other door is perfect. This problem is not evident until the whole thing is put together (doors go on last). Not worth the trip to return/exchange -- and possibly have the same situation on the next one -- but will not be buying the taller bookshelf to go with it."
20275885,Nice unit but I would’ve. Nice unit but I would’ve preferred to have assembled the perimeter pieces and then slid in the shelves as was done with the expedit in the past! This unit required two people to assemble as where as the expedit only required one person ! Bring back the expedit design please !!!
10305741,Easy Storage System. Purchased for storage in a child’s closet. Toys have been out of control and the squares are soooo much larger than the typical cube storage you can find elsewhere.
70342199,Good plant shelf. Good and sturdy but I didn’t attach the wood shelf at the top.  Too much damage from water. Instead I used an old rack from at oven.  Wood and plants don’t mix.
80275887,Versatile unit!. Huge fan of the Kallax system and this is 4th shelving unit I purchased and turned it sideways to use as TV console in the kids playroom. It's anchored to the wall and very sturdy. Easy to put together and matches our kids playroom very nicely!
60275812,Love these cubbies. We 3 of them ! 2 in a bedroom for clothes and one in an entryway for shoes! Will be going to a college dorm next year! They went together easily and quickly.
19278272,Great features. Fits and look lovely in my lil space
20275885,. It looks great I love the color
80275887,Great value. Great look.. I brought to help organize my dressing area. Look fabulous.
60275812,Great as a nightstand. I bough this a month ago. I love the color and it looks great in my room. Assembly was pretty easy but it was nice I had extra hands.
10409932,Great Organizer. Great organizer for a small space.
60275812,Easy build. Easy to put together and great color.
70301542,"BIRCH. They discontinued the Birch color, which was the best."
40275846,Great. I like what I bought. it looks good in my room. Looking to buy another one.
50339292,"One of my favorites!. This is one of my favorite pieces of furniture, probably because it’s so different. The raw industrial look is catchy, and it’s rare to find it for such an affordable price. It’s taking extraordinary willpower not to buy the rest of the set and completely redo my living room in all Fjallbo. The design’s not without flaws though. There are no predrilled holes in the wood shelves for screws. While this isn’t too big of a deal for reasonably handy people, it does mean an extra level of care is needed in assembling if you want everything straight. Also, my doors are not exactly flush with one another. I feel if I were to mess around with the leveling feet a bit, as well as the corner braces, I could get them better situated... but it’s a slight annoyance I’d rather not have to deal with in flat-pack furniture."
59278307,Versatile unit. I bought these units and created a sewing room cutting table. I placed two of them back to back and glued a table top on it. The units were very easy to put together as everything lined up perfectly. A good quality product for the price. My new space is exactly as I imagined it!
89278301,". Very good quality, I loved it, it’s really worth it !!!!"
40275846,Daughter Loves Her Shelf. Christmas present for my Daughter and she absolutely loves it.
10305741,Easy assembly. Easy and fast to assemble. Love the shiny white finish.
19294535,So much organized space. Looks great on our wall. Just adds a cool feature.
10275862,"Works great. This isn't the first Kallax shelf I've bought but it's the biggest in this line. The finished product is great, as usual, but this was the hardest one to build so far. We broke two pegs putting it together and had to drill them out. I was extremely lucky that I've saved every extra Ikea peg I've ever gotten and had enough to finish building the shelf - otherwise I'd have been in trouble. My apt isn't big enough to have this thing just sitting around while I wait for spare parts. What I learned is that Ikea needs to have those little wooden pegs more easily available, or possibly include a few extras with every product, not just a few here and there. But like I said, the finished shelf is fine, it works just as well as the others I have."
20275814,"We love this shelf!. We are so happy with this shelf that we now have two in our home. Easy to assemble, looks great in any room."
40415192,"Love, love, love!. This shelving unit is perfect in my kitchen. I bought 2. I'm using them for my bar/pantry. My house is tight and everything needs a place. This unit corrals all of my stuff. If it doesn't fit on these two shelving units, I don't need it. The color is the exact shade as the paint of my stairs. I couldn't ask for a closer match. I purchased a Hemnes shoe cabinet to go neItxt to it. I'm going to use the paint on the shoe cabinet for a better match. The Havsta shelves have a rail across the back so things don't fall down behind. I'm thinking of cutting out the baseboards behind for a more flush fit. It is super easy to assemble. I did it on my own in less than an hour. The bigger bottom is great for the booze bottles and the food stuffs are up top. I'm thinking of putting white quartz to match my kitchen on the top of the bottom part."
70286645,Great insert for the Kallax shelving unit. Great insert for the Kallax shelving unit! We bought the largest unit (5x5) to use for our daughter's toys and the drawers worked to help us organize and compartmentalize her toys. The quality is decent and it was easy enough to put together.
60275812,"Perfect fit. Fits perfectly behind my couch; holds a lamp and my coffee cup while reading, Blanket fits nicely into one of the units and my cat loves her bed."
60333954,Very difficult to assemble. very difficult to assemble—it broke during the process and is now headed to the dump. Very frustrating experience. Design is great but ikea needs to do some re-engineering so assembly is easier. Do not recommend wasting your time or money on this.
80275887,Closet organizers. Love these in all shapes and sizes. Used as closet organizers. Just be creative!
50334591,Neat little box. Fairly easy to assemble. Neat product
20409936,Awesome unit. I decided to use this unit as a dresser and it works perfectly! I love the diversity of it being able to use it upright or on the side. The cubes work amazingly!!!
20275885,"So simple, so easy. Ended up buying three Kallax Shelf Units to help tie in my dining room and replace our bedroom dresser with a different style of storage. The variety of fabric drawers that can be used is great, it makes it easy to play with different colors and styles."
40346924,TV stand. We got this piece for Christmas to put a new TV on. The TV is 55in. and it fits perfectly! I think this piece looks even better in person! It's sleek and clean and looks great with gray and white bins. I would highly recommend.
10409932,I like it's simplicity.. I use this style as my main storage in the basement.
20275885,Modern Feel. The optional glass top makes the bookcase stand out and is the perfect home for my Venice glass pieces! The box type of shelving makes good use for books and the $3 containers for miscellaneous items!
20275814,Kallax= new storage. I bought these for my sewing area. I love the amount of storage I have now. I put a Bekant table top over these and it works great as a new sewing cutting table and storage area.
99017445,"FAVORITE FAMILY!!!!. This is my favorite line from IKEA!!! Easy to put together, sleek look and very user friendly!! Easily elevated my work space to an office."
20275885,"great bookshelf!!!. We love this bookshelf. We positioned it on its side, under a window. Full of cook books now. Very easy to assemble. Well built."
40275846,". I bought this for my son to put his vinyl record albums in for storage.  They fit perfect, and he is very happy with the look. He also like the fact that he can use it vertically or horizontally."
40346924,Very versatile. I bought several of this units and I have all over my house. I love it how versatile this is.
20275885,"great product. It was easy to put together, and fast. Looks great once it is put together"
80275887,Great size and proportions. This works perfectly for my son’s apartment with the fabric boxes. It’s an efficient use of space and attractive.
00415599,KALLAX Shelf unit. My husband bought this for me for my birthday to store my Card stock paper. I am very pleased with this product.
90305803,Wiggle. I got 2 of them a month ago they look very nice but is very wiggle
39286266,"Fun, space saver. My daughter did a small remodel of her room, creating a “bohemian feel” This table fit perfectly. Easy to assemble and attach to the wall"
40275846,Perfect bookends. I bought one and then had to purchase a second one for my husband!! Love the way it Fits our decor.
20275885,Good!. We bought this a month ago and we were so happy that we finally had all of them here in our new house.
20275885,:). :)
20275885,"Sturdy and good looking. NOT your cheap construction. The reason it got lower points was it was missing half the pegs. We had to get pegs to finish. NOT GOOD. I recommend, but be ready to go out and buy missing parts."
70286645,"Really useful!. Adding a set of these to my Kallax shelf gives me useful, easy access to smaller items. Mixes well with doors and baskets to make your shelf exactly what you need it to be."
00275848,Wish it had a back. Looks nice and was easy to assemble. I just wish it had a back to it.
40275846,"Exercise Equipment Storage. I bought this unit in black-brown about a month ago to hold miscellaneous exercise equipment in my husband's man cave. We use it horizontally, and it fits perfectly in the space. It feels sturdy, and looks more expensive than it was. Assembly took maybe an hour. My only complaint would be the way the dowels connecting the shelves fit. It took a little elbow grease to make them fit."
10409932,Great for toys storage. This Kallax shelf unit is great for toys storage. It's easy to assemble and instructions is clear. It comes with all the thing you need to assemble the unit. It also comes with the anti tip kit as well. It is durable and fairly heavy.
80275887,"Perfect for vinyl storage. If you collect records you probably already know about the Kallax series. The shelves are the perfect size for LPs, the units are cheap and look fabulous anyplace you put them. I purchased three white 8-cube units for my wife’s craft room, and currently have my records stored in three black 8-cube and a 4-cube. I am considering purchasing the 5x5 cube shelf."
70286645,"Already fell apart. The front of the drawer ripped out of the base already. I have another one here that I haven’t built yet. Hopefully, I have better luck with this one."
80275887,Exactly what I was looking for. perfect storage for all my clothes in a cute minimalistic manner that fits my aesthetic
80275887,"Nice Sturdy Unit. A nice sturdy unit that the user can add extra features to like drawers, doors or even tubs. The unit has nice easy instructions to build the unit where almost anybody should easily be able to build them. There are exceptions to this though as a co-teacher was confused immediately upon opening the packaging that she had to hire a contractor to build the units that she had bought. I've bought 3 of this particular style plus I purchased two 4x4 units and a 5x5 unit and all were so easy to build. When you build the 5x5 unit make sure that you have somebody there to lift the unit as it is heavy."
30275861,Great board game storage. Most board games fit really well in the cubes.
40415601,Great for organizing. I bought couples month and it works for my closet organized
70301537,Large storage. This large wall unit is going to be great for all of my craft supplies. I can’t wait to fill it up. Assembly was easy and the quality is great.
10275862,"Makes organizing a breeze!. I purchased the 5 by 5 Kallax unit last year for my sewing supplies and it worked out so well I went back this year to purchase the 4 by 4 Kallax unit for my scrapbook supplies! They help keep things organized and keep all my supplies within easy reach, which makes being creative and productive so easy!"
10275862,"Great construction. Just purchased this recently and it is very sturdy, well built, and looks amazing."
70339291,Looks so good!. I bought this about a month ago and love it! It looks great in my dining room.
80334603,So cute!. I bought the wood underframe to go with this and I use it for my herbal aerogarden. It’s simple and does the job.
20275814,"Kallax, versatile and sturdy. We bought 3 4-cube Kallax to use as a base/storage for a crafting table. They went together easily and are very stable and sturdy."
20278167,"flimsy and wrong screws. I wanted doors, and because we had to get this set up for a client visit we made do. Unfortunate that they sell a good set of shelves then send this cheap stuff out. Short screws (we had to run out and get some that worked) and flimsy cardbord insert means the doors don't work right. After the client meeting we may return but unfortunately there are now holes in the shelving unit."
89278301,"Sewing Room Project. I bought several pieces for my sewing room, this specific piece I bought two and made an island work surface. To raise the height we made a simple wood base. I have plenty of spaces for fabric, thread, ribbon, etc."
80334603,"Just what I wanted. Product works great - was not difficult to assemble. When putting some of the sides together it did require quite a bit of force but nothing too crazy. The product dimensions were not completely accurate. I measured the height of the space I wanted it to go in 3 times and checked against dimensions of this before purchasing and I should have had an extra 1/4 inch of space but instead the cabinet was a little taller than the height of the space I wanted it in. I was still able to use it, but that was a little frustrating."
70301537,Sturdy unit.. Easy to assemble. I'm a 61 year old woman and put it together myself with a three person lift at the end.
40346924,Love the style!. Bought one unit months ago. Went back and purchased another plus more configurations to create a very useful storage area! I'm using these in my bedroom and absolutely love them!
70301542,Fits so many books!. My husband said we had too many books and photo albums to fit into the shelf unit. But I had plenty of room! Love it! Very sturdy and much easier to assemble than it looks.
50305739,. Love this flexible multi-use unit!
40346924,great for everyday living. I use the Kallax for absolutely everything!!! from clothing storage to kitchen cabinet to living room displays
60275812,"Love it. I bought this to house my router, etc in my home office. I will be purchasing a larger one"
70301537,"Nice. Very nice, a little hard to assemble. Wish it was assembled with more screws than dowls. Overall nice though."
80334603,". This is a great product, buying more"
60275812,Quality Produxt. Both were easy to assemble and very sturdy.
20275814,"NEW SHELVES DON'T MATCH THE OLD SHELVES. FIRST/BIGGEST FRUSTRATION....the 3 Ikeas closest to me College Park, MD; Baltimore, MD and Woodbridge, VA have NOT had the 2 by 2 Kallax birch effect (402.758.13) for at least a month even though it is expected on the next truck.....a bit like Waiting for Godot. SECOND FRUSTRATION I managed to buy one because someone just happen to return one the day I checked. When I put it together THE NEW KALLAX IS SMALLER THAN THE KALLAX I BOUGHT 5 YEARS AGO, so I cannot use the units together. Good news the drawer inserts will still work. I need just one more Kalla (402.758.13). I thought about using a 4x2 Kallax birch effect (502.784.82), however that would leave me with this odd shelf unite that does not match my old shelves and is not useful in my new small space. Does Ikea take shelf units back after they are built?"
10305802,. Love it although I wish the pressed board had premise holes.
30275861,Awesome. This was perfect for my girls’ bedroom for toys!
40275846,"Great for the price. this is my 6th kallax purchase. I've used them for shelving, tables and even the foundation for a captain's bed. They are strong, affordable and attractive.  I a 5'4' woman and can put units of 8-cubes or less together myself. The boxes as shipped, however are a 2 person lift and over 8-cubes I work with a partner to put the units together. Highly recommend this product."
70286645,A great addition to our shelving unit.. Love the look and function. Makes the space so useful and organized.
00275848,Awesome!!. I love it ! It can be used horizontally or vertically. Sturdy and not too big or small. I plan on getting some of the other configurations too.
80275887,"Great product!. Just what I needed to add to my craft room. Sturdy, great quality & easy to assemble."
80334603,plastic connectors easily break. the mount of force you have to use to connect the sides often makes the plastic connectors crack. not sure why the entire Eket design relies on plastic as the main connectors
70286645,"Drawer Unit. I love these. The sides aren’t deep, which isn’t a problem for me but understand it is for others. You still have the full depth of the drawer, and FridgeBinz fit in here perfectly if you need to contain smaller items."
70339291,Great Shelf Unit. I purchased the item last month and it fit perfectly for what I’m using it for. I store my extra counter top appliances on it.
60275812,Heavy duty material!. This product is wonderful to many uses!
10275862,kallax shelf unit. I have bought 4 of these units for my grandchildren's toys. I use the plastic boxes from IKEA and everything fits nicely into the cubbies. There is even room for extra snuggie blankets for nap time.
80275887,"Versatile!!. I bought this a month ago to use as a floating shelf below my TV. I use it to organize my pillows, magazines and a basket for kid toys. Very nice product and value."
20275885,Easy to assemble!. Love the look and durability!
40275846,Kallax. Great storage for the money. Would recommend anyone that needs to purchase storage pieces go to IKEA first!
30275861,"Love my Kallax. This unit was perfect for my craft room. Easy to assemble, quality product & very sturdy."
80303437,"Love this piece. This piece completely tied our living room together and looks amazing. As usual, some words in the directions would have been more helpful than pictures so make sure you have everything sided right before you start screwing things together."
70286645,I loved!!. I loved!!
30275861,perfect for the space..... great storage organizer that you can tailor to your room through your choice of baskets. Only wish that some baskets were included because they definitely add to the cost. perfect solution for small bedrooms to eliminate need for dresser.
80275887,Great Craft Storage. I bought this item for my craft room and absolutely love it. My scrapbooks and paper fit perfectly plus there is lots of space for other things like photo boxes and my Big Shot!
50339292,Very attractive.. This is a very stable shelf. I put two baskets on the middle shelf and they fit perfectly. The doors fit perfectly and open and close good.
80275887,Love it!. Very sturdy! Stores a lot of items
20275814,. Simple to build....sturdy and perfect for adding bins for use by the sides of our bed.
10305741,great furniture. to save space in my bedroom
60275812,"I love it, I use it as a file cabinet.. I love it, I use it as a file cabinet."
60275812,Great Product. Love it !! great storage .
50339292,Love this piece. One of my favorite purchases ever
70301542,Does the job. Very difficult to put together and when moved it would want to fall apart. But after it was put in place it looks nice and does the job
30275861,"Great space saver. Took no time to put together, it’s a great space saver/ book shelf. Great to put their toys in, wish the storage boxes were a little more studied."
80275887,Great utility shelf! We are. Great utility shelf! We are using it as a book shelf.
90286649,Perfect. Drawers go perfect with the kallax shelf unit
40275846,Simple storage solution. I needed vertical storage for my son’s apartment. This unit was perfect for books and other desk items. It’s nice because it doesn’t take up much floor space.
20275814,"Perfect shelf!. I am so happy I bought this, since this little shelf holds more then it looks."
60275812,Love it!. This is a great storage cabinet. We added the Drona Box organizers as well. It's perfect place to organize and hide those items.
70286645,"Easy to install. Looking at the material, it has little bumps here and there that seems like it might get chipped in the future."
60278170,. great product with trendy look
20278167,"Kallax Cabinet Door. Works perfectly for me. Helps to keep 12 x 12 scrap papers hidden in their respective containers. Easy to get to, when needed but hidden from view when walking in."
30275861,". love, love, love my kallax!!!!!!!!"
20275885,Great storage space for my barbershop. Holds all of my barber supplies
50339292,Great price. Looks great. Much better prices than any similar design elsewhere. Very sturdy.
80401292,Nice add-on. I have 2- 1 in the bathroom and 1 in the office. Great for subdividing the 12×12 cube space.
60275812,Perfect for my space. Love all things I have purchased at IKEA
30275861,"Lots of Trouble. This was very difficult to assemble, the instructions were not very clear and the little wood pegs for joining the pieces together broke quite often necessitating a trip to the hardware store for replacements. I have purchased many IKEA pieces over the years and have never had any problems with the assembly. It functions well now that it is assembled."
29278304,"Cost effective, flexible and attractive. I used two units. One horizontally below a window and butted it against another unit vertically creating a corner L shape which combined both storage and open cubes. The open back allows access to the electrical outlet under the window, and the storage flexibility is simply outstanding. We used the Ratan inserts and doors and drawers and open cubes. Looks fantastic for about 10% of the cost of custom units. Assembly was straightforward, I got really fast on the drawers by the time I was finished!"
20275814,Perfect unit!!. This is my third kallax unit. It will support my scrapbooking table top. And I can fit more items in it.
50339292,. Its one of my favorite items from ikea.
70342199,"Tedious to put together, but nice overall. I bought and put together two of these. This shelf might be tricky if it's your first time assembling furniture. Because it's metal, the screw holes are inflexible and make it difficult to turn the screws (and using a drill is not recommended). There were over 50 screws to put in for each one, so it took me about an hour for each unit. However, the end result was pretty nice and solid. Oh, also, the top wood part didn't have holes pre-drilled, so you have to make your own--just be careful not to drill all the way through so the hold doesn't show on top."
60275812,"Love this product. I have five of these units. I plant to buy more for my other home. I store everything from clothes, toys and bedding in the pull out baskets"
60275812,sturdy product. Good storage unit and appearance
80275887,"Very good quality!. Very good workmanship! All parts/holes lined up perfectly! Very easy to assemble and looks like a high quality piece of furniture....even though it is particle board inside. The screws, dowel pins and hex key were quality material also, unlike other unassembled furniture kits. I used a rubber hammer to gentle tap the parts together, instead of a regular hammer that was recommended."
20275814,. Perfect size. Great value.
80334603,very nice item!. We love these! great quality and great price!
10345073,Great addition. Got this item from the Last Chance section; adds a nice touch to my Kallax shelf unit.
10409932,Great Storage Great Price. We are hard core Kallax believers. We also have Expedit shelves which are its predecessor. We use the drawer add in and the door add in and we use Pinterest hacks. Very sturdy and versatile. We keep buying more of them!
60221683,perfect pantry piece.. perfect pantry piece.
00334536,"Good storage. Bought 3 boxes about a month ago. Finally got around to assembling. Got down to the last piece of 1st box and discovered we put one of the pieces out of order. Had to remove 2 of the pieces to get it right. Started with 2nd box and same thing happened. By 3rd box finally got it right, but barely. I guess we have a hard time following pictures. Would do better with written instructions."
30275861,"Kallax shelf unit. I love the kallax, I have 4 different sizes and they are very easy to assemble and look great!!"
80275887,kallaxl shelf on it. easy to put together and look good
20275814,. Very sturdy...Bought a month ago and needed something to place my kids electronics on other miscellaneous items along with the cube tubs fits perfectly in the room.
80275887,". This is probably the 10th Unit I have purchased in three years because it is the best size, shape and strength for both my home use and at work."
50339292,"Nice display item. I bought this to hold my record player and display some of my Funko POP items, while having a little closer storage. It is perfect. I even had some room left to display a couple pictures next to the record player. The industrial style is exactly what I wanted and I hope they do more products similar to this."
60278170,"very functional. A great complement ro the Kallax cabinet, it adds sofistication to a nice storage unit"
50214678,"Perfect for smaller spaces!. Love this shelf unit! The glass gives it a better look. Really great for smaller areas. Would definitely recommend for lil knick-knacks and small pictures. I gave it 4 stars only cause the first one I got had a scratch on the glass, but it was easily exchanged for a new one so I’m happy"
20275814,Light weight perfect storage piece. I bought this as a replacement dresser using storage boxes. I had a sore wrist when I built it. It was easy to put together.
90286649,"Add style to any modular unit. Decided to try this on a LAPPLAND television unit since the modular sections are 15x15. I bought one for my unit and when installed, is not perfectly flushed with the edge it is off by about 3-4mm, but it is no big issue - I replaced the flimsy knobs with glass handles from home depot and it looks amazing when completed! Like other people have mentioned, and as the instructions direct, you will need a small power tool to easily and properly install the drawer - this is important to take into consideration since not everyone has a tool handy or feels comfortable using one. Also, like others have stated, it is meant for light objects as the base of the drawers is cheap pressed board, but if you are handy with tools, you could easily cut one of the preferred thickness. For me, the whole process took about 40 minutes."
80275887,"Great for toys and books in kids rooms. We have two of these, one in each of our kids rooms for books and toys in bins. They actually like cleaning up their rooms before bed. We use them laying on the long side so the kids can easily reach all of the cubbies."
20275885,I love these!. Good quality and pretty easy to assemble. My 7 yr old grandson and I made this to organize his toys.
20275814,". Exactly what I needed, the quality is great, ease of construction so simple and easy"
80275887,Very strong after construction. It is serving my purpose as expected. Glad I purchased it
80275887,"It’s great but.... I bought this a couple of weeks ago and once I got it home part of the packaging was scraped up and therefore the bookcase was damaged. Need to be careful when choosing the carton you want. I threw away my receipt so I hesitate to take it back. I haven’t opened the carton but I’m sure the employees would feel like I did it myself. I love the product, just not the carton I chose."
70339291,A great shelf!. I have 2 of these shelves!
20275814,"As Pictured. I bought this to use as a TV stand and storage for dorm room. Works and looks great! I also purchased the storage cubes for it as well. Only issue and it wasn't a big deal was when assembling, some of the wooden pegs didn't go in smoothly or equally. We had to slightly pound them in and there is still a little gap that we can't get rid of."
50214678,. great works good i will buy more soon
80275887,Good and sturdy!. We love it. It's nice and deep. Sturdy design! Def would recommend.
50339292,Great for the home office. Love the look and all the space to store home office stuff.
30275861,"Such a practical piece of furniture!. The wooden dowels make it easy to put together, so don't be intimidated by its size. The large cubby size is great for books, notebooks, storage bins, the potential is endless."
80275887,Great shelf unti. This is our third They used to be called Expedit We had two of the 25 cube units in the past Love these shelf units
80275887,"As advertised. Overall a good product. The shelves are deeper than I expected and hold A LOT of stuff! The quality is so-so, sort of what you'd expect from cheaper IKEA products. While putting it together a few of the wooden pegs snapped in inside of the holes, but the shelves still feel pretty sturdy. The one issue I have is that it has only been in my apartment for 2 days and the paint is already scratching quite a bit with barely any use."
80275887,. Great looking sturdy shelf.
60275812,. Used it for a tv stand/storage.
80275887,Love it.. Love it.
50334591,. Bought box shelf to store photos. Had considerable difficulty assembling. Ultimately used tape to hold it together.
20275885,. It's nice. 15 characters.
40415601,It’s ok. We bought this to organize some clutter and extra books etc. nothing heavy. It’s okay but the wood pieces are really cheap particle board and easy to crack and split while trying to get the shelves in place. You’d be just as well of buying the cheaper thinner one from Walmart.
40346924,". Got this shelf for my son and daughter in law new home fits perfect in their bedroom, they love it."
20275885,I'd give 0 if option. All scratched up. Looks used possibly or dont know what happened. Very flimsy. Called support to ask for assistance and that was over 3 wks ago. Guess it will be a target run
50339292,"Great Addition to My Room!. I fell in love with the Fjallbo series a while back and i finally had the opportunity to buy the shelf unit! It helped unclutter my room, while adding style. Word of caution when assembling it: make sure you follow the direction exactly, count holes and pay attention to front and back. I had to start over at one point. But it was worth it! Beautiful piece! Pay attention also when putting the doors on. Mine do not line up. Yet. Still have to redo the one side."
40415601,. Bought as a office file cabinet and organiser. Works very well for me.
70301542,"Perfect shelving unit for almost any space!. We have 3 of the Kallax shelving systems in different sizes. Easy to put together, look great, very stable, and functional."
60275812,Great storage!!!. I bought 4 of these to use as storage and platform under my kids bed!!! Works great!
20409936,So Versitile. I have a few sizes of the Kallax shelving units because they are so versatile. This unit (3x4) I use for a wall unit in our media room. I have my record albums on one side and our movie collection on the other. In the middle shelves I have memorabilia. I may add some of the door inserts to hid the remotes and additional cables for the TV and Record Player.
70342199,"Love it!. This is great for our receiver, projector & albums. We like it so much we have another one on our list to display handcrafted chess sets."
80275887,Just what I needed. This unit is just what I needed to clear the clutter from my laundry room. Not too big or deep for the area just right.
10275862,best buy yet!!!!. I purchased two of these units for toy storage and it is absolutely perfect! I have received so many compliments on them. I finally have enough storage for all the toys in my house with some room left over!
70301542,Gamer's Heaven. Great shelving unit. Fits boardgames like a glove!
80275887,"A couple of tips for easier assembly. The holes in the top and bottom are sized so that the screws bite into the wood; so when you screw the top and bottom to the sides, the screws push the two pieces away, no matter how hard you push. The fix is easy: before you put the top and bottom on, drill out the holes a little bit so the screw slides through easily. A 7mm or 9/32 drill bit would be perfect; I didn't have either one of those, so I used a 1/4 and then pounded the screws through with a hammer one time before attaching the top and bottom.  On the subject of pounding, while the wooden dowels can be inserted with a hammer, but a rubber mallet makes it easier to push the pieces into the holes once the wooden dowels are in place."
90286649,"Great twist. Bought them to add space to put my undies and socks, notice they are a bit narrow for it so decided to used them on top for accesories and it works perfect!"
30275861,"Great nerd storage!. My husband and I purchased this as storage for all of our various collections of comics, Pop figures and stuff. It has worked out perfectly for us. We are probably going to purchase some of the new inserts on our next trip."
20275814,"Function, attractive and budget-friendly.. Sturdy, easy to assembly and looks smart. I love the versatility of it: open shelving or small storage when pair with DRÖNA bins. It even offers a cozy sleeping spot for kitty, if IKEA ever restocks the LURVIG cubes (I'm waiting, IKEA). I docked one star because the wooden pegs used in assembly aren't substantial; two broke as I pieced the unit together. Also, it doesn't include any screw head covers, so the screw heads, though flush, are visible on the top of the unit."
70301537,"Heavy duty!. I am so happy with this shelf unit. It is even more than I had imagined. It is very heavy duty, I had to half help come over to stand it up after assembly. And it was on sale the day I went to get it, so what a bargain!"
80275887,"Great shelf!!!. I bought 4 Kallax 8 is what we refer them to for my craft studio. It is perfect to hold all my stuff. I love this, because it can be used horizontally, or vertically!"
20275885,Shelf love. So far it's holding up my daughter loves it.
80275887,"My god. I bought this about a month ago and I LOVE IT. it’s perfect and sturdy. My only complaint is the box. It is so heavy. You will not be able to carry this on your own. As some one who tried to, I only got 100 feet. I struggled the entire way, I then found a shopping cart, managed to get it in there, then had to push the cart into my car on the loading dock to get the box in there. It was a horrendous experience that was WELL worth it. Also the people who work at Ikea are so friendly but if you go on a Sunday in the late evening, don’t expect any carts because customers don’t return them, so get it before you start through ikea."
60275812,Do it. Perfect record organizer.
60275812,". I love this shelf, I used it as a computer desk and put some books in the squares it looks modern and diferent!! Im very pleased."
99017445,Great pick up!. I used it as a tv stand in my living room. It looks amazing.
99017445,"Great bookshelf. Very sturdy bookshelf. I also like that you can purchase inserts like drawers or doors, i bought four doors and inserted them where i wanted! Assembled it by myself and it went fairly well."
20275885,Great shelving. It is a very sturdy shelving and it works great for my office.
90286649,Great drawer option. I have a small salon suite and the Kallax shelf is great for storage in my limited space and the addition on the drawers are perfect for keeping smaller items organized and handy
60275812,"Doesn’t match Expedit. I bought this to sit right next to the older Expedit model to expand the shelving. Unfortunately, it is about a half inch shorter than the Expedit. I will raise it up with a piece of painted plywood. Still a great value for the money. Color matches perfectly."
20275885,Awesome shelving/storage unit!!!. I got this to put my granddaughters toys in so they are hidden as they stay in the living room... Works great the girls love it
10305741,"This is my FIFTH KALLAX. I'm sure I'll be back!. I've bought four Kallax units range from 2x2s to 2x4s and even one 5x5. They're perfect in my craft room, in my master closet, and for organizing in general. Sturdy, solid, easy to put together. They're rock-hard, and tough as nails. I bought 8 of the fabric bins to use in this one, and I'm very happy I did. My stuff is organized, neat, and hidden in fabric bins."
70301537,"Great shelf!!!. I bought this to hold my numerous stamps. I love it, because it holds alot."
80401292,"Functional. Multifunctional. Could be use for wine bottles but I use it for my craft room. Can store paper rolls, pens, scissors just anything."
20278167,Ugh. Difficult to install. Had to use drill to make pilot holes. Stressful to get straight.
60278170,it's easy install. follow the instructions it's easy to install and it will look as professional installation about the price just for 1 insert & door a little to high
30275861,"Sturdy and strong. I was skeptical at first but when I put it together, it was strong and sturdy and could hold the weight of a sewing machine(or two)in one cube"
20275885,Love it. So adaptable!. We bought two of these and placed them in an L to serve as a TV/storage unit. We added 4 sets of 2 drawers and 4 1-door units in birch. Easy to assemble. Looks great!!
20275885,I love these. They are so universal!. Easy to put together. I do it myself! And it's so universal. Can be used in any room or anywhere that needs organizing and it looks so good! Pretty sturdy too!
00334536,. Bought this for some extra storage & display space by my desk. Great size & sleek look.
70339291,"shelf unit. the shelf unit was easy to put together, we need a shelf for books and pottery and this fit the bill."
30275861,sturdy - easy to asemble. easy to keep clean - we put small book lites on the shelf to light at nite
40275846,"very functional. Perfect addition to my home office, enough room to store aomw of my computer parts. Books and stationary that I uae often."
60275812,I love my stand. I bought this center for my sons play area and it fits the area
30275861,"Easy to assemble. I bought two of these shelf units to help organize my fabric. I am a 64 year old woman. My son helped me put the first one together, and I was able to put the second one together all by myself. It holds so much material, and I am able to see what I have rather than having to open drawers in dressers or pull down bins in my closet. I am very pleased with this product."
60275812,"So functional!!. Easy to put together. Great accessories to add to it, like drawers. The drawers were a little more difficult to assemble, but function well with this unit. This is my third unit. Highly recommend it. I recommend putting cushions on the bottom of anything that may scratch the surface though. I use the IKEA rattan baskets and sometimes they scratch the finish if you don't put a barrier between the basket and the unit. Great price, too!"
40346924,Large size cubes. Bought this for our son’s room & it works for its intended purpose. Our oldest boys ( 31 & 29 ) grew up with ikea furniture in their room & we are keeping the tradition going.
20275885,"Poor coordination with other furniture piece. The shelf unit after connected with the Linnmon Table Top, the bottom shelf units become useless or not convenient to use the space."
70342199,Better than I expected. Perfect. Better than I expected. Perfect for my needs
10305802,"Easy assembly, perfect style. Very easy even for novice assemblers."
99017445,"Works well. Works well in my space placed on side,with doors anb draws."
20409936,"Craft room solutions!. My IKEA pieces have survived 4-5 moves and are in great shape. Excellent value,"
20213312,Exceeded expectations. Solid shelf that looks great at a very fair price.
60275812,It's lighter in weight. The are lighter to move around but sadly that mean structure is compromise. I went to put one together and the wood started to crack where the screws were going in.
10305802,"Vittsjo. Perfect for what I needed, tv stand for a slim area. High enough for the bedroom plus extra shelving for extras"
40415601,. Exactly what I was looking for!
10409932,Easy to assemble. Love it! Would buy it again
40415601,"My favorite shelf, we have. My favorite shelf, we have 3 in different sizes!"
80275887,Love this product! So worth. Love this product! So worth the long wait to hold out for it and not settle on another store’s options.
50339292,"Looks great, easy to assemble.. I bought this and so far am loving the look of it. Assembly was relatively easy for Ikea furniture and while the doors didn't initially line up, it was easy to fix. Overall, I love it and plan on getting a few more pieces from the collection."
40275846,Fit great. Fit great
80401292,Makes the wine more oranganized. Makes the wine more oranganized
80275887,Great for adult storage and kids as well. Using this in our kids playroom but also have one in ou living room for eletronic items storage.
10409932,"Great shelves !. Very sturdy, versatile storage. My adult daughter and I put them together and it took about an hour."
80275887,"Love the Kallax!!!. We have 18 of the 8-cubby Kallax shelving units in our home! In our office we attached 4 to the wall to create an office space; and did the same on the other wall. In the craft room, we used 2 of them to create a crafting table. The rest are here and there throughout our home. The Kallax shelving units are inexpensive, but are built well, and look expensive. I definitely give 2 thumbs up for the Kallax!"
80275887,Good product. Good product
70301537,"Very versatile!. I bought this in December (5 months ago) to replace some heavy wooden dressers in my bedroom. I used some drawer inserts and baskets for clothing items on the middle row of cubes for items traditionally put into drawers. I then had the rest of the cubes to display photo frames, store blankets, use as book shelves, or display plants. It really makes my bedroom look great!"
80275887,Love Kallax. These are the best storage cubbies. I love them. Have them in my closets with the Drona boxes. My husband has some in his train room. They are a great staple to have.
70342199,Amazing shelf unit. I have bought 3 shelving units and I love them so much
20275814,Great night stand and organizer. Great night stand and organizer
10275862,Great closet additions. Great update to my walk-in closet
40275846,"Fits to a T. We bought this to sit under a window and provide storage for toys. It conveniently doubles as a bench. It was easy to put together, sturdy, and is working just as we hoped."
60275812,"Sturdy and easy to assemble. This is the 2nd storage unit, like this, that I've purchased. I love how sturdy it is and all of the storage options you can buy to go with it. The price is also VERY reasonable."
20275885,Very good. I’m happy with my shell unit
70301537,These shelves can’t be beat. These shelves can’t be beat for storage
50214678,"Beautiful and functional, but assembly. Beautiful and functional, but assembly had to be done twice once we figured out where it should be connected since the pictures didn’t show the additional holes for the braces."
20275814,"Great Bookshelf, Poor Shipping. The bookshelf itself is great; just what I expected. Assembly was a breeze, and it serves its purpose!  The reason for the four stars is that shipping from IKEA was a horrible experience. It took more than two-and-a-half months to get the thing. I know there are shortages and shipping issues, but that's ridiculous!"
00415599,"Perfect solution. I needed additional storage in my small laundry room and this piece works perfectly. With baskets and fabric “drawers” I have an attractive, neat place to store all of my supplies."
20275814,"Great storage shelves. Very sturdy, quick and easy to put together by one person."
80275887,awesome. awesome
30275861,Great additions to my craft. Great additions to my craft space!
50339292,Great. I bought one month ago beautiful and perfect design I love it
10275862,Excelente. Excelente
10409932,Worth the money. Worth the money
10345073,"Works as intended. They were a little stiff and tough to install because there is no wiggle room to clip them into your shelf so trying to pry them off is even harder. Other than that, they work well to add more ""shelf"" space to tall shelves"
20409936,This worked great for a. This worked great for a place to put the TV and store plenty of items in a small room.
30275861,"Love it but.... I love this shelf, is it a space saver! It took us a little over an hour to set it up between two people! It was a pain to put together, in part because of how many pieces it has and in part due to our uneven floor! Put it together on a very, and I mean very flat and even surface otherwise you will sweat it!"
00415599,"We use these everywhere!. I have these in my studio, in the cat room, as an entertainment unit in our spare bedroom... they're SO versatile!"
20275885,Looks good but screws too long. A couple screws pushed wood up on outside wood leaving bumps on outside edge.
89278259,Kallax. Still trying to purchase item. You've been out of stock. Can you help?
20275814,"Sturdy, nice design. Put this shelf in my son's room to have a designated place for him to display, store, and play with some of his Lego sets. Deep enough for even the larger sets."
10275862,". No instructions, in box but my h8sband put it together. And we love it."
00275848,"Love this!. This shelf unit is one of my favorite things in my house! It was so easy to put together, and the price was fantastic! I'm using it in the horizontal position under a low window - looks like a window seat."
80275887,"Very sturdy!. IKEA has come so far with their furniture design. Yes, they still have soft pine furniture and if modestly used it holds up great. The KALLAX shelf unit on the other hand is very sturdy. Our household uses things in more of a heavy fashion and my husband shys away from a lot of IKEAS furniture for that reason. I brought this home on my own and the plan is for books and toys. My husband kinda gave me the look, like this may not hold up like you want. I bought two of them because I loved the stores display of one upright and one horizontal. My husband put them together in record time and was very impressed with the quality. Each cube opening is both large and deep. The baskets I was able to put in the openings were almost empty looking compared to the toys overflowing out of my previous storage. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and I even have my husband considering IKEAS kitchen cabinets because of the sturdiness of these shelves."
40275846,"4 cube Kallax. Excellent! We added 6 feet to this product to get it off the ground as it lay horizontally. We have 3 other Kallax units. So well made, and sturdy. The accessories are phenomenal!"
30275861,Easiest IKEA assembly ever!. This is the perfect piece for organizing. It is lightweight for it’s size but very sturdy. Bonus is that it was the fastest and easiest assembly I have ever done.
70339291,"GREAT STORAGE. Loads of storage with an artistic, rustic vibe"
90495695,"Kallax & Kallax inserts. Went together easily. Works perfectly, loos great."
90286649,Love it. Very easy to assemble. and it looks great in my work area.
20409936,"Great, solid shelf for board games. We love board games in our house, and have way too many of them. That’s led to a storage problem - bookshelves are too shallow, and other shelves we looked at didn’t have large enough spaces for all the strangely shaped boxes. We picked this up, put it together in an afternoon (heads up - we needed a rubber mallet to help get some of the wooden pegs in place) and it’s been perfect."
30275861,love the size. When I brought this home and carried it upstairs one piece at a time (the boxes were to heavy for me to carry by myself) the last piece was crushed on one side. I was devastated. I thought I was going to have to carry everything back down again but after a search on the Ikea website I found out I only had to return the damaged piece. They replaced it with no problem. I bought this to go into my craft room. It is perfect for all my scrapbook paper that is 12 x 12. I put most of it together by myself. My son lent a hand when I had trouble with a couple of wonky screws and then when I placed it.
10305741,Great. I love these shelves. They are easy to assemble and they are strong. I bought two of these and one is going to be my TV stand. NICE!!!
70342199,"It was great, until your missing a piece. I really was excited when I got it. Brought it home building it until you notice your missing one of the curved shaped brackets. I received double the amount of screws instead and two other metal pieces that's not even feasible to even be on this product. Where the quality checks before shipping. I knew I should have opened the box and check all the parts. Check the merchandise before boxing it up."
60275812,. I have bought quite a few of these shelves. They are sturdy and hold a lot of stuff.
70301537,Great room divider. We bought two units to divide a room into two spaces. They worked great! We faced with wall board to create a solid divider with storage on one side. Perfect solution at $400 when one estimate for a similar wall was $3K plus! IKEA to the rescue!!
20275885,"Kallax Shelving. We have 3 of these 8 cube shelves. Two are on wheels - fantastic look, fabulous quality -- they're sturdy and we have zero issues after 2 years. One we stood on end attached to a wall - I added legs to it. These fill space, add storage, separate small stuff, and the accessories are great!"
10345073,Beautiful Shelves. I bought these for my daughter to help her get organized. She loves them! Thank you for a great product at a great price.
30275861,"Great inexpensive unit for closet. The Kalyan pieces can be used for so many things. I put this unit I. My closet and bought the Drona boxes to put sweaters and clothes in. I love it. Got the boxes in gray, red, and white, which look great in my closet. So much space! Such great prices! Does take a bit of time to put together."
10275862,"Flimsy. It works for what it is, but kind of flimsy it’ll bend move around with a slight push."
80334603,Look just awesome on my. Look just awesome on my wall!👍🏻
70301537,almost 5 star. Looks great. Does the job intended for. Just top piece was missing pre-drilled holes to finish supporting the shelf. Who wants to take apart a shelf like this to exchange it for another? so we are doing the best we can with wiggly vertical dividers. I wish I could have given a five star review.
20409936,"Kallax is a great system if you can find it in stock. I love the Kallax system of shelving. It is affordable, easy to assemble and install, sturdy, and looks great. The drawback is that it is so popular, it is difficult to find in stock. Patience is your friend."
80275887,"Sturdy, looks good Grady flexible design.. This latest one we set horizontally and used the bullig boxes to create a “toy box” for our 4yo in our apt living room. Fits great against the back of our gronlid couch. We also have 2 others in our daughters room with the drawer and door inserts to be like a wardrobe/everything cabinet for her (babies and toddlers need a lot of stuff)."
69278335,Great storage. It was amazing how much I was able to organize and store items which helped to unclutter my sewing/craft room. The shelves are deep and hold quite a bit. Even the drawers were able to hold a good amount. We utilized services of Task Rabbit for assembly as I didn't feel my husband and I would be able to put this together. I am very happy I was finally able to purchase this item.
20409936,Solid Cube Unit. The unit is similar to other cube units but seems more solidly built than comparable models. The styling (white) is nice and I like the accessory options which I may add later such as drawers.
20409936,Love it!!!. Perfect to storage
00275848,"A+ for Versatility. I first got the Kallax to use as a window seat with the cubbies housing books and even some yarns I happen to be using for projects. Later on, I decided to move it upstairs and use it vertically, still as a bookshelf on our small landing. My husband saw that and realized he could use another to house his vinyl collection so we got a second one."
40415192,Good. Fits perfect
50339292,Great storage unit. Great storage unit
20275814,Solid bookcase. My wife is totally pleased with this purchase and that is all that matters ...... excellent buy!
70286645,"Decent for the price. The Kallax is lighter than I expected, and the instructions are not super helpful. If they showed in which direction the raw edges should face, that would have made it easier.  The drawer and door inserts are super flimsy, and the knobs are tiny. I will replace the knobs. Still, not terrible for what you are paying."
20275885,Perfect. Perfect
20275885,"Simple TV shelf. Bought this to support my TV. I have the shelf on it's side. The shelves are mainly used to hold board games, which fit the cubbies perfectly."
60275812,Studio shelf. Great size and when together good.
40346924,Solid bookcase. Bought two for my kids rooms. One is used as a small entertainment center. They were so good I went back and purchased a third. Easy to assemble with a second person.
40415601,Perfect size. I bought this a few weeks ago and love it. It is the perfect size and helps so much with organization. I have it on the wall next to my front door and it a great place to put my keys and stuff when I walk in.
10409932,Love it. Super sturdy and beautiful
99017186,"went together quickly (took longer. went together quickly (took longer to put the doors together!), looks great, just what i wanted"
80275887,. this shelf unit and the others in this series are so versatile and practical!! this is the second house that i have reconfigured our closets in and these shelves are a lifesaver...the drona bins are perfect for holding plenty of clothes and everything looks tidy and pretty for mama...
70286645,"Nice compatibility. I bought this insert with two drawers to use in my cube storage, and fit perfect. I loved <3"
80401292,Easy assembly and perfect for. Easy assembly and perfect for wine storage. Holding 9 bottles is awesome.
30275861,"Great Organizer. ...makes my large room (disguised as a closet) look organized, and, now easier & more fun to work in!"
00388633,Great for Making a Wall Unit. We created a unit that fit our wall perfectly with the narrower open bookshelves and the tall glass door display cabinets. Havsta collection is sturdy and well made and easy to assemble. We love the clean look and the variety in the collection to create the look we wanted to achieve.   The display cabinet has spacer pieces on the back to account for positioning against a wall with baseboards! That was a welcome surprise and really shows the consideration that went into the design.   The spacers were not included for the narrow open shelf though. The anchoring kit for the open shelf does accommodate being set a little away from the wall for baseboards and what not but we still felt more comfortable adding some of our own makeshift spacers to keep the shelf in the right position and not pitching backward.
00275848,This product works for my. This product works for my project & affordable .
70301537,"Great value for great storage unit. I purchased during the year end sale to use for getting tubs of memorabilia out onto shelves to sort and organize. The product is solid and looks great, although I'm using in a storage room. I did add white shower board to the back, attaching with staples. By the way, Ikea suggest 3 people to assemble and setup this unit. I'm 74 years old and I was able to do it all by myself!"
10345073,Cute but not sturdy. I bought this for my LAPPLAND Entertainment system. Its super cute but I put 1 vogue magazine in it and it hangs very low. It's as if the magazine is too heavy for the basket which baffles me.
10409932,Perfect. This is my second unit for my craft space. The different options available for it help me customize it the way I need it to function.
19278272,Easy to use.. Great storage remedy for my small space.
10305741,Works perfect for my cloffice. Works perfect for my cloffice
10409932,"Very handy, sturdy. Easy to put together. I'm using it with the long side down. All good. I've been using Ikea products like this for decades. Highly recommended."
59278307,Excellent furniture. Bought this for my Daughter she loves it
20275814,Great piece!. Great piece!
70301542,"Kallax unit. I love my Kallax unit. It was easy to put together, very sturdy and looks great!"
60275812,Easy to assemble. Very functional.. Easy to assemble. Very functional.
70301542,"Great room divider. I was a little daunted by the number of boxes this came in, but myself and my roomate, both all of 5ft tall managed it ok. It was a little harder to assemble than some of the other ikea furniture we have, but not excessively so. Definitely recommend having a soft rubber mallet and some old washcloths to pad it to help get it together easier. It makes a great room divider and is very sturdy, especially once fastened to the wall with the provided anchor (you do need to provide your own drywall screws). Overall though it was exactly what i hoped it would be."
10305741,Great shelving unit. Wonderful shelving unit we turned it on it’s side and put basket in it for storage and a tv on top works great
20278167,Wanting more!. I am going to get more of these to use on my set.
70342199,Wonderful shelf!. We bought this shelf a few weeks ago and loved it so much we bought 2 more! It doesn’t stick out super far so it’s perfect for a narrow hallway or bathroom.
20278167,"Didn’t fit. Couldn’t get it to fit properly, wasted my $"
30275861,"Easy to assembly. So many uses!. I bought this for our homeschool room. It houses all of our books, games and supplies. It looks nice and holds a lot! I'm very happy with it!"
20275814,Easy and quick. I highly suggest elevating the look of this shelf with 4-6 legs! Love the way it looks and its super sturdy!
20275814,"Love it!. Durable, easy to assemble, and love that it's a space saver."
60275812,Great simple storage solution. I have a few of these shelf units as well as a couple in the larger sizes and they are a great simple storage solution. I use them in our office/craft room. I love the variety of items that work with these shelf units to include the drawers and DRÖNA Boxes. It's easy to customize them for my needs and make them look great!
79278269,Nice shelving unit. This is a very nice unit. My mom needed a stand for her tv and this fit the bill perfectly and reasonable in price.
40346924,"Storage!!!. Great look and easy to put together, love it!!!"
99017445,. am totally in love with it!
20213312,Quality and style. I bought 2cof these for my foyer and get nothing but complements.
20275814,. The only shelf unit that holds vinyl records.  I looked around for months and compared sizes and pricing.  Kallax was the only one that worked.
90286649,Awesome. Awesome
20275814,"Computer desk. 1 side has an existing bookcase, added this 1 on opposite side and covered with counter top"
60275812,CDs will not fit in these drawers. I thought this would be perfect to store CDs. Two rows in each drawer with the titles up so I can see them. But alas they are a quarter of an inch too short. I may try adjusting the liner by lowering it 1/4. And then sanding 1/4 off the bottom of each drawer front. If I ruin it - no matter since I can’t use it as it is. Nice - but falls short for my purpose.
20275814,Very sturdy and goes together so easy!. I love all the furniture I buy at IKEA! They are an excellent quality for my dollar. Easy to put together and always looks nice.
20409936,Looks really good!. Looks really good!
80275887,"perfect!. I bought this for my teen son's room. We have limited floor space so this gave tons of storage for books, his printer, and other school supplies without taking too much room. We added a small Linmon desk top to it for the perfect small study space."
80275887,Holding my massive record collection. These units are great. I was going to stand them up but we decided to lay them on their sides. They look great. They are sturdy enough to hold my massive record collection. Great buy.
20275814,"Clean lines, lots of chic storage perfect. We knew these book cases would be perfect as we remodel and work on our seaside bungalow"
80275887,"Great addition to home. We needed a clean line storage/book shelf and this is perfect for the room, and for the money we are thrilled . It looks clean and cool, holds a ton, so light after building , easy to move , multi-purpose, so happy"
20213312,Looks great!. My son wanted something to display his shoes in his room. This works and looks great!
60275812,"My second one and I love it!!. These are so functional yet very nice looking! I love that I can put flowers, decorations or whatever on top, but WHATEVER I want to, in the baskets (not included). I have two of the black/brown ones and am soon, going to buy a white one for my bedroom."
20275885,"Kallax bookcase. Well designed, well made, easy to assemble, very strong."
60275812,what we wanted. The cabinet fits perfectly. Exactly what we wanted and made the space look even nicer. Easy to assemble.
10409932,"Perfect for kid toy storage.. We'd been waiting for these for ever! We were thrilled when we found the 3x4 shelves in Kallax. Perfect fit for a small wall in our kid's bedroom. And all of her little dollar store baskets fit inside. Love them. Wish the wall braces held into the wall, but that may be the fault of the wall, not the shelves. There wasn't much wiggle room for the placement and they pulled right out of the drywall. But we'll figure out some other way."
80275887,I’m in organizational love!. Perfect for my sewing room. Easy to assemble. Came quickly and without bumps and bruises.
20275814,"Totally awesome. Paired this with existing white dresser and IKea fabric boxes. Great storage, looks neat and everything is put away. Price is unbeatable."
20213312,"Great style...especially for the price!. Love the style...does not look cheap, despite the inexpensive price! I bought only one, but will be back for several more to use in my office! Easy to assemble..."
60333954,"perfect for holding records. This shelving unit is perfect for my space, it’s like the popular Kallax but not as much depth. It fits vinyl records perfectly and it was super easy to build. Highly recommend"
50339292,Nice looking and sturdy. This is a very nice piece of furniture. Look great nice price
00275848,A very nice bookcase. I bought this bookcase because l was looking for some affordable and nice pice of furniture. The Kallax bookcase was a very good decision and looks good in my room. I used it to also like bench close to my window and it looks awesome!! I do recommend this product!
20275885,Simple and good looking storage solution. The Kallax is a versatile and good looking storage solution. Very easy to assemble.
30275861,Super storage. I love this unit! It’s BIG & gives me a ton of organized storage in my craft room.
90428842,Cube. Love the idea that you can peace all these cubes together and make your own look in style.
30275861,"Space and storage saver. I was looking for storage, but I did not want something that was an eye soar. This unit looks great and it’s a space saver."
20275814,Great durability quality. Good quality and perfect for organizing.
20275814,Love these. Love this Kallax. Going to put this in a closet with Drona boxes to hold towels and sheets. You can put these in so many places. Easy storage.
10275862,"Perfect for our needs!. I bought two of these units to use them as a room divider. Perfect! Love the way they look. We use them as room divider, toy storage and crafts supplies storage. Really good quality."
60278170,"The product is awesome. However,. The product is awesome. However, the way they were packaged to be sent to me was extremely sloppy. Luckily, none of them was damaged during shipping via FedEx. The box was at least twice as big as needed and there wasn’t anything in there to keep the product from staying in place."
20275885,We own 4 of these. We own 4 of these and are about to pick up another. We're really happy with how nice they look and how easy they are too put together!
10409932,"Simple, easy to put together.. Simple, easy to put together. I didn't cuss. Much."
30275861,"NIce. Easy to assemble. Good quality. Sturdy.. In 2 boxes. Need a dolly or strong person. Or open the box in the car and move pieces a few at a time.  Easy to assemble. Took about 30 minutes. Nice finish. Sturdy for its size. Very please. Very affordable compared to others on the market. Been trying to buy for a year. Finally caught it in stock and they opened buy on line, pick up in store in the St. Louis store. Win- WIn and very happy!!"
80508504,Perfect Insert. More affordable and sleek than the doors with knobs and you can leave messages in chalk.
19278272,So practical. Not only is this product practical but it’s also stylish and versatile. It’s sturdy and easy to assemble as well. I used mine in our closet as counter space. We lined three up along one wall and put our folded sweaters on the shelves and store our socks and under clothing in the storage cubes. All my accessories are displayed on top. Above the “counters” we used ikea shelving to hang clothing and store purses and other items. It’s so cute too.
10409932,Excellent product. This is what I’m looking for. Been waiting for so long since it out of stock quick. Finally bought this for my child to place his toys with buckets.
80275887,Just what I needed. I bought this a couple months ago and it's perfect! My daughter has alot of books and fit all of them. It looks great and was so easy to put together. You cannot go wrong with this purchase.
20278167,Stylish and Functional. I bought these instead of a basket to give my Kallax a clean look. I was worried I might lose a substantial amount of space but the insert takes up very little space on the inside.
80275887,Wood dowels weak. Love the kallax but STRONGLY recommend spare dowels. They are so soft and break easily. Had to “make” one or wait for one to be ordered - did that once and never received it. Be VERY careful putting together. Overall love size and Stryker and finish.
30275861,Perfect cubbies. I needed these for display shelves and they work perfect. Very clean & sharp looking and serve their purpose.
80275887,Just what I was looking. Just what I was looking for. Great in my bathroom.
60333954,Garbage. Plastic dowels snapped while assembling.
79278325,"Love this organizer, I for. Love this organizer, I for my son's toy's and books."
20305745,Works as advertised; heavier than. Works as advertised; heavier than anticipated but that's a good thing.
90286649,Easy to install.. The drawers were easy to assemble and work great for my desired use. Now sure how they would be if you planned to use them daily.
99017445,"Nice!. Nice solid piece of furniture, very easy to assemble. Used with 2 single Kallax units. 1 vertical as a shelf unit with the other horizontal (w/drawer and door inserts) between the other two pieces perfectly holds a 55"" TV altogether makes a great wall unit"
10305741,"I love it so much!. I love it so much! This shelf does not seem big and doesn't take much space, but I can put a lot of stuff in it . My things are organized, looking nice and going vertical to safe space in room."
29278304,"Versatile Bookcase with lots of accessories.. This is my second one of these. The first had 25 cubes. This was a lot easier to assemble. As always it fit together precisely and works vertically or horizontally. The accessories (I added lots of drawers) would get tedious unless you use a drill/driver set on low torque. But it was worth it for the finished product. IKEA's bookshelves, cabinets, and anything else you need to assemble looks as good or better than traditional furniture that costs a lot more. What amazes me, after building more than 20 items, the oldest ones from 10 or 15 years ago are still working flawlessly."
70286645,Great addition. Love this drawer set for the Kallax unit in my office to keep desk supplies.
90286649,Great addition!. Love this. We had the shelving unit for a few years now and wanted to make it look a bit nicer and add functionality. This did both! Love how easy it was to install and how it changed the overall looks of the shelf!
20275814,Great as either storage unit or bookshelf. Bought this to organize books and what nots. Sturdy. Good looking and plenty of space for whatever you want to organize.
70301537,. My husband and I put this together in less than an hour
70286645,Love them!. I purchased these drawers to help organize things that got laid on my counter all the time. I just love them!
40415601,Good sturdy product. Good sturdy product
80275887,"Great Product!. I've seen a lot of shelf units, for the most part they all seem very unstable. This unit is surprisingly very stable it supports my smart TV and i'm happy with the product!"
80275887,perfects - as expected. exactly what we thought
60333954,"Frustrating assembly. The puzzle from Heck. I've never before had trouble assembling IKEA furniture, but this one threw me for a loop. It's hard to tell which parts are the ones shown in the instructions, and I never did manage to get everything to fit together. I finally ripped out the back panel and then the other panels finally fit together. In the future I'm sticking with IKEA shelving that screws together rather than these that key together."
60275812,"good bargain. just right, these work well for storage, would buy again"
70286645,Great product.. Good quality and very easy to assemble. I was looking for a shelf and drawers for my new apartment and these are perfect product what I was looking for. Very reasonable price and love the simple design.
40346924,Good for storage and display. Good for storage and display (the color)
20275814,It worked great for my. It worked great for my storage solution
60278170,"pretty strong considering. good hinges. Cardboard back and sides, particle board with wood veneer door. Good adjustable hinges. not bad for the Ikea brand. I had problems assembling kallax shelves. broke wood dowels, and they must be metric. nobody carried them. drilled it out and used 1/4 wood dowel. not bad, but not great. holds LP records."
70342199,"Looks great!. So glad I made trip to IKEA, do manny great items on my wish list"
90286649,Love these drawers!. Love these drawers and they add incredible organization to our Kallax Desk! Great option!
70342199,FJALLBO. Great End Unit
20275814,Favorite furniture. So sturdy and versatile. I have one in almost every room. Also very easy to put together. Takes about 15 min and I'm a 120 pound person.
70301542,"Kallax 5x5 shelving unit. Bought the storage to organize my craft room, it is exactly what I needed. Lots of room, easily fits 13”x13” canvas boxes. Pretty easy to put together but had some issues with the wood pegs."
80275887,Great Storage for front hall. Needed a storage system for out front hall area. This fits the bill perfectly
60275812,"Late review - easy rolling bar. I bought last year? To frame up a rolling bar. Top came with a couple of scratches, but swapped the top out easily the next day. Added drawers and a dorr and it's looking good."
80275887,Great for extra storage. added the bins and has lots of extra storage right where I needed
40275846,"love there units , I. love there units , I have them all over my house"
50339292,Wonky Door. The left door will not stay closed. Followed the instructions and the magnet does not line up with the unit properly
80275887,Great size and look.. I bought two and theyre Just what I wanted and needed to make a cutting table with storage in my sewing room. Also bought a butcher block top.
00275848,Easy to assemble and very. Easy to assemble and very sturdy.
70301542,"I love this. I don't know why I waited so long to buy this. I actually purchased two. I attached them to the walls perpendicularly and created a closed off area (with door passage) in my open floor plan. This became a teen hangout, for all her things, her loft bed, couch and game systems. The Kallax puts together so simply. You don't appreciate how simply Ikea items go together until you buy another box-kit! In any case, once attached to the wall, this is very sturdy. I'm going to buy several more for different uses in my home."
40415601,"Perfect storage solution!. The Kallax shelf is a great method of storage instead of a traditional dresser. We own two and really enjoy using them in this way. It's fun to have a variety of Drona boxes to pick from, even if some colors sell out really fast!"
80275887,"Perfect for my salon!. I bought this piece so I could customize it for my needs in the salon! I’ve added drawers and bins and glass shelves, it’s so versatile and makes everything organized and clean looking!"
90305803,"Recommend 💯. I love this unit. Plus the 4 other VITTSJÖ styles I bought.  They are in a total of 3 rooms in my house. And, I have them in both colors. I really love them that much. 😊"
60275812,. Exactly what I needed for the space.
90286649,Love the look. Overall these are great for the price but I was disappointed that the locking nuts were plastic. The first drawer I assembled the plastic piece broke.
20213312,"Great looking shelves. I bought this unit to display my knickknacks. It’s open, airy design is perfect for corners. It needs lighting though and I am going to see if I can integrate OMLOPP LED lights."
80275887,Love it. Does it job have it set it up in my craft room
20275885,"Great Find!. Sturdy, fun to add pieces like drawers and shelves in it...love it! We ended up buying two!"
70301537,"This really is a massive. This really is a massive shelf, but it is exactly what we needed organizationally. With all the different inserts or “cubes” available we have customized this shelf into all the things we needed (toy bin for baby, school supplies for our Kindergartner, junk drawer, craft supplies, coffee/tea cart) and still have it look classy! I love that it is easily mounted to the wall for safety (comes with the anchoring device, you just have to provide the actual screw you drive into your wall)! It is really quite easy to put together, once you do the first row and get the hang of it, it’s smooth sailing! I highly recommend if you need a lot of storage and want to customize what that looks like"
20275814,. Bought this shelve for our bonus room and love it.
90286649,Excellent for the price...using for. Excellent for the price...using for toy storage
20275885,Extremely happy with my purchase. Excellent piece for you any room
20278167,Thank you. Thank you
70301542,Fantastic deal. Fantastic deal
60333954,"EKET Cabinet. I have purchased two of these cabinets and am looking to purchase another one. They are both stylish and functional. Putting it together was a bit of a challenge due to the fact that the instructions were not done in the clearest way possible but once you put it together, it is a great piece of furniture. Since it is such a uniquely shaped piece, be aware that most storage boxes sold for other units won't work well here. I suggest purchasing the EKET box which is made to fit perfectly in this unit and look very nice."
10305741,"Little boy’s room. This fits inside my son’s closet, 2 high by 4 wide. I bought a few Dröna boxes for him to keep his toys organized. I expect the Kallax will be used and enjoyed for years"
60275812,"holds LP records. it holds Records which was my use. I also got the doors. its pretty strong. I added some epoxy to help strengthen it up. the wooden dowels are thinner than 1/4 so if you need to you can drill and use dowels, like I did, since I broke their wooden dowels. you have to push some thru the particle board into the vertical board , if you don't alight perfect it bottoms out and breaks. careful..."
60275812,"Kitchen organization redo. The shelves are sturdy, large, and easy to assemble. This size allows you to stack them if necessary."
50339292,Great addition!. I bought this a month ago and I’m so happy I did! It’s a shrek edition to our work out/media room!
40275846,. Added to my 4x4 book shelf
80275887,"Great shelf unit. I bought the grey and wood effect unit since the other colors look rather generic. I added six captiva legs to the bottom to raise it off the floor, horizontally, and it looks better and more high end, plus I can dust under it. Other big box stores carry units that are similiar, but I have found the Kallax unit to be better quality, thicker materials. However, the inserts that go into the unit are now very low quality, so stick with using baskets and don't waste your money on the door unit inserts or drawers inserts. Too bad ikea lowered the quality on those, what a shame. Also this shelf unit is great for records!"
70301542,"Using as store look & branding. We use Kallax for our Math educational store. It has perfectly-square good looks, is sturdy enough to survive our students, fits everywhere, and provides maximum shelving space."
99017186,Very versatile. Easy to create. Very versatile. Easy to create your own look with different inserts.
00275848,Love the brand. I have several of these units in different sizes. Easy to move by myself but strong.
50339292,Good sturdy product.. Good sturdy product.
30275861,I love the Kallax! It’s. I love the Kallax! It’s just what I needed for my quilt fabrics!
70301537,Love it!!!. Large enough to get all my crafting and sewing supplies in one unit with extra space but doesn't look insanely bulky! :-)
80275887,Exactly what I was needing. Exactly what I was needing to store my sewing fabric plus gives me added table surface.
20275814,Very nice product.. Very nice product.
20275885,Media Room. Perfect for our media room
60275812,. Happy with it. Most likely will purchase more
60333954,"Impossible to put together. This was an impulse buy, largely because of the spectacular light orange color on the showroom floor. However, it is impossible to get the backing board on before you add the top. We spent an unbelievable 90 minutes working on this and ended up just leaving the backing off. Too bad because it's such a cute piece and now it has these weird track marks where the backing should insert. It does brighten the kitchen up beautifully."
00275848,I purchased this unit out. I purchased this unit out of the As-Is Dept to use in my closet for extra shelving space. It works perfectly!
19386101,"Great kitchen storage. Our kitchen does not boast a lot of storage space so we bought this to house our “countertop” appliances, like the Instapot, crockpot, and toaster. The Eket holds everything neatly and the feet give it a more elevated look than the Kallax would look sitting on the ground."
00334536,Great efficient beautiful product. Great efficient beautiful product
80275887,"Great Features. This was an addition to my sewing studio. Previously purchased the Expedit series, but they were discontinued. This was the replacement. Easy construction!"
00415599,Kallax. Went together easily. Looks great in basement play area for grandchildren. Today it is holding toys for the little ones. In the future it can be incorporated into a library area to hold books or be modified with a choice of add-ons like drawers or doors if desired. A very versatile item.
60333954,simple design. I like it. Looks good and easy to put together.
19278272,You get what you pay for. It’s not the greatest shelving in the world. But for its cost it worth the purchase.
00275848,Shelves. Very sturdy
20275814,Would recommend. Would recommend
00275848,perfect for our small space. large size squares for towels or large items. not high quality but it does the job
30275861,"Great Shelf. I purchased this after seeing it at a friends house. I love the size, the style, and the color. I bought a white one to go with my grey walls and oak colored flooring. Fits great and makes a great focal point in my room."
30275861,"Kallax rocks for kids. Just bought my 8th kallax. We use it for toys, mud room, craft organization. And more. Love the bins, drawers and doors that help conceal the mess. Also love the clean lines and simplicity."
29278304,Kallax. I love love ❤️ love ❤️ it.
39017486,"Great Space Saver. Easy to put together, but we had to go to Home Depot for extra parts. About $7 extra, but definitely worth it."
19278272,Great storage unit!. Needed something for a long hallway and 2 combo pieces fit perfectly. I now have storage to fit several different types if items and can happily start organizing my home!
99017445,Perfect for crafters!. My roommate and I craft and make our own cosplay items. This is so deep and sturdy it holds everything including a IKEA cat hidy tote in the bottom for the cats to nap in!
70342199,Good. Nice also good item easy to clean
30275861,"excellent storage. These are great for toy storage. I had the largest one for several years and then downsized to this one as the kids got older and didn't need as much storage space. With baskets in all the squares everything is neat and tidy, at least at a glance!"
19278272,A good little storage unit. This unit works perfectly in smaller spaces and keeps clutter hidden away while also providing bookshelf space.
00388633,. I bought this for my daughter to replace an old bookshelf that was falling apart. She loves it.
10409932,A must have!. Loved our first one so much we bought a second. Two more are on our wish list. This product is extremely flexible and functional!! It’s also super simple to assemble.
90286649,Great system. We bought the shelf and some baskets that are made to fit the KALLAX system and recently added the drawers. This system can have a use in everyone's home
60278170,"So Disappointed, not like they use to be at all!!. I bought a Kallax about 8 years ago and the door inserts then were all wood and didn't require you to screw into the shelf. I decided I wanted to add 2 more and now they are cardboard and must screw into the shelf permanently damaging it so you can't change it later. They are also much harder to align. VERY disappointed. To top it off the black/brown color also changed so they don't quite match color either. Based on this experience I would not buy a Kallax shelf system again. What a shame."
10275862,"Handy organization. I bought this his as a Christmas gift for my son, and it is just right for shelving books. He also loves that he has a place to display completed LEGO projects."
70286645,Love this addition to my kallax. These drawers work out great paired with the kallax system. It added 48 drawers to my cutting station in my studio.
80275887,"Poor quality. It was broken and scratched, and we had to return it."
10409932,Kallax Storage. Kallax Storage
40303439,. Practical & easy to assemble. It is much needed beautiful storage for my daughter's room. She displays all her knick-knacks and wants to add decorative vases. Such a beautiful display to help her transition her bedroom into a pre-teen oasis.
70301537,"Great storage. Works great in playroom for toys, books"
60275812,"Amazing piece. A great value, amazingly sturdy and practical for many uses — lots of cube inserts available to make it even more useful."
70332124,Clean and contemporary design EKET...using as nice stand.. Fairly straightforward assembly. You need to use a hammer with a cloth between the frame and hammer to get the seams on the miter corners to line up. Looks great once you make the seams match up!
00275848,Storage. Love them They need to add Dark Brown Inserts and make the bins cream or ivory!!!
40275846,Easy assembling and looks nice.. Easy assembling and looks nice.
40346924,lovely item. Great color. lovely item. Great color
60275812,"Great product. Bought for storage in my office with the canvas baskets, it is perfect"
40346924,It is perfect!. It really is a great and versatile piece of furniture. I love it!
10275862,Bought this for my daughters. Bought this for my daughters sewing room and it has enough cubbies to hold all her sewing supplies
10275862,Kallax. I bought this set along with some of the drawers and cubbie cubes to go into my living room beside my baby grand piano. I was looking for something to house all my music as well as some of our treasured Knick knacks from our travels. This fit the bill beautifully
00415599,I love it. I love it
10275862,Excellent quality. Super easy to put together! Very sturdy and love that it came with hardware to secure it to the wall!
80275887,Closet solution. This was a perfect solution for our kids’ closet!
80275887,Love it 🥰. Love it 🥰
00275848,Simple and Easy. This shelf is perfect for storing items out of place but easily accessible! Its so simple to put together and the size is great for small spaces. Fit my needs perfectly! I’ve actually bought several of these for different areas of my home.
20275885,fabulous. This holds records and 3 ring binders gorgeously. So love the options for it too.
40415601,"Kallax is THE versatile that you need!. We have a total of TWELVE units in our two homes...some single 1x4, some 3x3, several 2x2 (perfect nightstands with drawers and baskets)...they are so simple to assemble and look great with any decor!! Use as bookshelves, displays, dressers (just add the drawers and baskets)...Kallax is well-loved in our homes! Only wish they made the glass top piece for the 3x3!"
50334591,Difficult to put together even. Difficult to put together even though it is simple
70342199,Sturdy. Put this together in less than an hour. The shelf is very sturdy. Using it for game stations and a lava lamp. It’s a great addition to our room.
80334603,"Eket, built it !. We stacked four EKET blocks (some with doors, some with drawers) on rollers for our closet project. Screwed them together..........it came out great. We stash t-shirts, underwear, sweaters and socks in them. Made a great storage solution for us."
10275862,Beautiful super nice. We love this it’s great for organizing and it is very stylish.
99017186,Great storage unit!. Needed something for a long hallway and 2 combo pieces fit perfectly. I now have storage to fit several different types if items and can happily start organizing my home!
00275848,Love it!!. Love it!!
00275848,Great modern shelf for small paces. Purchased this shelf for a small spot in our living room and are very happy with what we are able to display in it. Hold lots of books and beachy trinkets great. Added some battery powered remote control led spot lights to highlight our items.
20275814,Amazing for storage. They are amazing for storage and they make my room look so organized. I have a total of 4.
70301537,"Sturdy, versatile organizer. Sturdy, versatile organizer"
20278167,"Very practical. I have almost a dozen of these doors throughout my good, and they are super practical. Yes, I have a *few* Kallax units. These doors are good quality but not excellent - they are a bit delicate and a tad flimsy. They look good though and you can swap the handle to make it fit your decor. Installation is not as easy as you would think but not impossible. Keep in mind that you will be drilling into the sides of your Kallax so if you remove tis insert, you will have holes left.  All in all, they are great to customize the fantastic Kallax."
80275887,Perfect. Bought this and the drawer inserts to store fabric. Works perfectly! I am so happy with this system! I painted it and decoupaged the drawer fronts and it is exactly what I needed!!
00275848,Nice and sturdy!. Loved it. Fits perfectly in my small space and shelves are a good size. I bought 2 of the material storage boxes and they fit so nice. Love that you have the ability to add different pieces to the shelves to customize it.
60275812,love it. I already have one and knew that another would be perfect for my home.
20409936,the product serves. my purposes. the product serves. my purposes
20275885,A shelf with many uses. Each shelf is big enough to fit many things. I’ve fit not only books but board games too. I’ll definitely buy another once IKEA restocks them in their inventory.
10345073,"Received bent. Was very excited for this basket to add to my desk cubes, but it was delivered bent. I am hoping to get a replacement as I think it will really add to the organization of my unit."
10275862,"Quality delivered. This was my first purchase with IKEA and I'm definitely going to make more. The quality and esthetic is as promised. The only downside is the construction. I put together 2 of these over a weekend. The fittings are REALLY snug. I don't know about anyone else but, after a week, I'm still suffering from ""IKEA shoulder""."
80275887,Perfect for my craftroom.. It was a great purchase and it has so many 'cubbies' to store everything.
70342199,"Nice looking, sturdy, pieces missing. Relatively easy to assemble, once you realize that you are not crazy - there really is hardware missing. I live 2 hrs away from IKEA, so had to improvise. Otherwise, it is well made and nicely appointed for a wire shelf unit."
90305803,Fits perfectly. I bought this piece a month ago and I love it. Fits great in my living room.
60275812,"I love the look that. I love the look that it gives my living, and there is extra storage."
99017186,"You need to buy these. I love my Kallax shelves. I actually bought five of them in various sizes. So many things I love about these shelves (in no particular order). 1. They look great. They're clean and simple. 2. The separate pieces are quite light but the unit is very sturdy when it's put together correctly. 3. It's easy to put together. If you get stuck trying to assemble it, you can always find help. 4. The units don't have that annoying particle board backing. I love this because my freshly painted walls aren't covered up by the unattractive backing and it makes it so convenient to plug stuff in. 5. They are so versatile. You can buy fabric totes or drawers or cabinet doors to put in the squares for added flexibility and storage options. This is actually what sold me on these shelves. IKEA sells a cat bed that you can put in the squares (who knew?) and I have one in my Kallax. 6. They are super affordable compared to other cabinets and storage units. Trust me, I scoured the internet for weeks. 7. My Star Wars collection looks great in my Kallax units and I am very happy with them."
40346924,clean and simple. Relatively easy to assemble and easy to store. Also good to display.
60221683,"Perfect for my purpose. This is an excellent replacement for my generic plastic home hardware store shelving, for my doll collection. My only disappointment was that the 24 units are no longer available. However, I have made the 46-1/2 size fit my room satisfactorily. I bought two units without the drawer kit, and four with. I will probably buy one more drawer unit; one shelf will be partially behind another in the corner, so I can't use the drawers for that one."
60275812,"Actually, this is the third. Actually, this is the third one I’ve purchased. Obviously, I must love this cabinet."
50339292,Love the industrial design. This series is a perfect style for my sons room. He really likes the doors and the combination of wood and metal. Great price for the amount of storage it provides.
60275812,An IKEA Best Buy!. We simply love our new shelving units. We purchased two of the units at the recent IKEA of Fishers grand opening and couldn't be happier. They were easy to assemble and loo great in our guest room.
80275887,"Durable!. Worth the price, seems durable!"
80401292,Easy to assemble and works. Recommend.
20409936,Excellent for the space I. Excellent for the space I wanted to put it in
80275887,Loved it!. These shelves are so versatile and fairly easy to put together. Great purchase!
10275862,Perfect for displays. These are perfect for use as displays.
30275861,Love it!. My only regret is I didn’t get the bigger one. The selves are sturdy and deep. It’s pretty easy to put together but does require two people due to the size. It looks fantastic
80275887,"So roomy!. I love it! This unit is very stylish but so practical! I was running out of things to put in there, really added needed storage to our small space without being so bulky. Those cubes are not to be underestimated! I have not found this value anywhere either, trust me I’ve looked!"
20278167,Love it. Easy to put together. Looks awesome!!
60278170,"Easy to assemble!. I added the door inserts to several cubes to keep toy parts from falling out the back, hide the wall behind the 9-cube unit, give it a sleeker look. It works!"
30275861,Great shelf but lacking extras pieces in case. The shelf looks great. I am not experienced in putting things together and am of small frame. I was able to do the all on my own except I need my child to help me to lift it off the floor. That’s a good sign to me; not cheap materials. My only problems with the first shelf (I purchased and put together two) was that it is held together by wooden dowels between the shelves and I broke one. They had zero extras. There were extras for everything else but no extra dowels. The chances of a dowel breaking is pretty high. Why would they not include any extras. I used an extra dowel that was half the size from the drawer inserts I bought. Now here’s the kicker.... when I put the second one I purchased together there was ONE extra dowel! Wow. If I had only opened that particular shelf to assemble first it would have worked perfectly. They are really nice shelves. They look great
19278328,Looks great! Liked the drawers better than cubby. The drawer inserts were easier to put together and looked completely professional when finished. The cubby with pull out door inserts were a little trickier because you had to get the screws just right so the door would open easily and stay closed when shut. I feel like the design could have been better. I thought I would just be installing a door on hinges. It is a box insert. I guess so your stuff doesn’t fall behind the shelf. Just wasn’t as easy as the drawers.
00275848,"Great product, versatile, can fit. Great product, versatile, can fit in any room nicely. I love the look and thickness of the unit."
40415601,Great features. I brought this about a month ago Fits well in my den. Sleek look. Not bulky Great for storage of children toys and books
80275887,Great shelving unit. My teenager assembled this by herself. It's very sturdy and is very functional.
19278272,Great basic piece for any room.. Easy to assemble. Very versatile. Recommend highly.
10409932,"Love it!. I got this unit, two door inserts and eight lidded boxes to organize my bedroom. It’s perfect. Ended clutter and some containers of seasonal clothes so now I don’t have to switch out clothes, also small blankets and books fit well in there."
60275812,"Perfect nightstand. This unit can be used for so many things. I am using this one for a nightstand. Buy 4 baskets to put in the opening and you extra storage. I have several of these and I use the for books, printer with extra room for paper, etc. It is very sturdy and well made."
20278167,Easy installation!. Purchased this for the Kallax units for my sewing studio. Easy to install. Love their appearance and they hide the messy stuff!
50334591,Awesome Organizational Tool. I purchased three of these to give me added space in my dresser for sweatshirts. They work wonderfully in both functionality and appearance.
20275885,Great shelving option. A size and shape that works for any room.
80275887,Sturdy. My daughter has two of these in her room and my son has one. We like that they can go vertical or horizontal. They are sturdy and we really like them.
20275885,"Awesome!. Buy it from IKEA directly (store) for just $65. Also the quality is great! However if you've never hammered anything in your life or haven't ever assembled anything, have an iPhone or are technology illiterate, then this isn't for you."
60275812,"Great price and great piece!. I love these kallax, they come in different colors and can be used different ways! Great price too!"
90305803,Love it!. Easy to put together. I liked it so much I bought another for the bedroom.
00275848,"Perfect for what we needed!. Perfect for what we needed! Quality furniture look. This is not our first, and we plan to.buy 2 more."
00388633,"The whole series is fabulous. It took months to collect the whole set (pandemic shortages) but we finally finished with the last book shelf in our living room. I love these pieces. They're sturdy, super straightforward to assemble, and provide a great background for our collectibles, plants, and books. We also have the glass front display cabinets and one of the base cabinets as a display stand for a 40 gallon fish tank in the same space. Can't say enough good things about them. They made my mom say: ""That's Ikea? Who knew?"""
20278167,"Storage. This product easy to install, and affordable."
49294548,Great unit. Easy to assemble and looks great. I used in my man cave as a TV stand and place to display my sports memorabilia. I love it.
99017186,Love it. It was easy to build and looks great in his spot!!
70339291,"Perfect size. I bought this a month ago and it goes perfectly well with the aesthetic rustic with industrial feel with a twist of modern. the instruction were ok. I've had my share of Ikea furniture (Alex,desk etc) this by far was the easiest."
90428842,"Eket. Easy to assemble, sturdy and versatile. You can make it your own!"
20275885,Great product easy to put. Great product easy to put together
89278259,"Really like this product line. Have bought several versions of these units and all look good and hold up. With the black finish small scratches can be easily repaired with a black felt tip marker. The light colored ones don't show small scratches. With inserts, I drill a small hole rather than try to start the self tapping screws for an easier install."
40275846,Easy to put together. Looks. Easy to put together. Looks great in my living room.
50214678,"Vittsjo dreams. I purchased two of these shelving units to flank my fireplace, as I didn't have the $550+ for comparable units through another source. These were better, as the shelves were glass an let the ambient & task light flow through. I was able to recreate the look from one of my favorite designers, that didn't disapppoint. Super easy to assemble!"
20305745,Organizing Fabric for Quilting. The Kallax that I purchased was to give me added space for organizing fabric. It was a perfect choice since I had limited space in my sewing room.
10275862,"Contains SO MANY BOOKS AND CDs!!!. I have dreamed of having one of these large, sleek bookcases that I have been seeing at IKEA for years! This is a dream come true! It is bolted to the wall, so compact and yet holds my lifetime book collection and CDs! (I donated lots that I no longer wanted.) This shelf unit holds SO MUCH, and yet it is not overpowering. It is PERFECT! Now, I want another one to display framed pictures!"
20454504,nice stand. Well made and pretty easy to assemble
20275814,👍. 👍
50339292,"STURDY BAR SHELF WITH A FUNNY NAME. Perfect size shelving behind my bar with open shelf, work surface, and hidden storage. Well make with a precise fit. The wood looked cheap in the box, but once assemble actually looked good pretty. Easy to upgrade to butcher block or other fancy surface at a later date. Very precise assembly and parts fit together perfectly (as is the case with most Ikea products)."
70286645,Great Addition to the KALLAX Shelf. I've purchased and installed 3 drawer units in two shelves. I may very well buy another for a shelf in another room.
80275887,Great storage shelves. As a knitter I have lots of yarn. These shelves are very nice for holding my stash.
20275885,New home owner. Very versatile easy to put together Multiple uses
20275885,Love it.. Love it.
80275887,Easy to assemble. Pretty and easy to assemble.
20275885,Just what I needed!. I'm happy with this item! I use it horizontally as a tv stand! Perfect size & just what I was looking for at a great price!
20275885,"Works Well. The price is affordable and sturdy that serves its purpose real well. I’ve used it for bookshelf, and it looks fantastic in my family room."
20275885,"Excellent unit. Great light weight storage unit. The color is almost black, not really much brown to it. The only complaint is my husband couldn't figure out how to use the mounting brackets. There are absolutely NO guidance instructions whatsoever. Once the bracket was in place the cover didn't fit on."
50214678,Perfect. We have a small area and this is just perfect !
60275812,Good product. Good product
20278167,"Getting the doors centered is a little tricky. I absolutely love these but it did take us a little bit of effort to get the doors centered so there was an equal distance between all edges of the door and the frame of the unit. This centering is NOT covered in the instructions but can be done by messing with the hinge adjustments. These also really need a drill to create pilot holes in the kallax unit so you can screw the whole cabinet assembly in, but this is not specified in the directions. If you are installing these into an older unit, you may have a slight color variation from your kallax unit."
80275887,. This is more spacious and less expensive than a dresser! Love it!
80275887,Details. I love the Kallax but for the price when banging the shelves into place it shouldn’t buckle in that area. Overall beautiful piece
80275887,High class. Easy to put together. I’m a 72 year old woman and it was a piece of cake. Thanks IKEA
20275885,Kallax Shelves. Exactly what I was looking for and they work great. Easiest thing I have ever put together from Ikea.
70332124,Great square storage shelf. I bought this about a month ago to use in my closet. I stacked six for extra storage taking very little space. I couldn't be happier. Love it.
00415599,Excellent room divider. Using this piece as a room divider/display case in front of my linnmon desk.
20275814,"Great space maker,. This is just what I needed to create storage in a sewing room. Very useful,"
80275887,Craft station. I do wish it it would still have the desk extension
20275885,Perfect for Board Games. Great for storing board games
60275812,"Easy to assemble, very pretty. Easy to assemble, very pretty piece in dark color."
90286649,Great drawers. These drawers are so easy to put together. I was done so fast.😃
20409936,"Nice solid piece of furniture.. Nice solid piece of furniture. Pretty easy to set up, but you really need to pay attention to the detailed drawings."
80275887,Nice shelf. This works great if you want a quick storage fix. The cubes that fit inside the shelf hide clutter or other storage items very well.
60278170,These make the unit look. These make the unit look outstanding
40275846,Great Storage. Used as a bed frame. Provides great storage!!! Definitely would buy again.
80275887,Perfect!. I purchased this shelf to use behind my teacher's desk to help organize my data. It worked perfectly! It basically is an extension of my desk and will be used as a second desk as well.
39278290,Perfect. Easy to assemble and looks great. Got the small drawers for smaller items and it works great
10305802,"Great shelf unit. We bought two of these units for a long wall in our bedroom. We wanted to put something on the wall, but nothing heavy, like a dresser. These were easy to assemble and give us an open look, at a very low cost."
00275848,Fast from box to use. I’ve purchased a few variations of the Kallax and they are quick and easy to put together. Just a few minutes from the box to putting it to good use.
60275812,Great way to keep by. Great way to keep by teenagers rooms organized and clutter free!
00334536,"Great in Kids Room. I put 2 of these units together in a bedroom that my 2 younger kids share. It’s perfect for books, trophies, and other small trinkets. I love the dark gray color and the shelves are very easy to put together."
00415599,"Missing parts. I can not assemble the shelf unit, the gag with the parts are missing, I only have the boards, I do not know who to contact to get the screws and other items to assemble this beautiful shelf."
60275812,Love it!. My friends have made great Ironing stations for their quilting studios
00275848,"Stores and organizes sewing and craft supplies. They were easy to put together but it takes two people.   I wanted to make it easier to move around my art studio. I glue a square piece of cardboard (exact size of the bottom), attached 4 wheels to the bottom of the self unit.   I have white Kuggis boxes with lids with different supplies on the shelves. The boxes look good on the shelves. I bought a variety of sizes of the boxes for different supplies. I printed white labels with green font listing the items in each box.   My art studio is so organized, bright and neat looking that it is a pleasure to spend time in there."
20275814,"Easy to assemble, good value. Easy to assemble, good value for the cost"
60275812,Very sturdy. The cabinet assembly was easy. Very sturdy and holds my crafts!

20278167,Great storage solution. The kallax shelves and doors were the perfect solution for extra storage in my kitchen
80275887,Nice looking and sturdy. Nice quality and went together quickly.
20275814,"KALLAX. Great product with doors and drawers that enhance its aesthetic and compositional possibilities. Only wish that glass doors, available in the IKEA UK, were available in the US - specifically in California."
69329387,"Looks Terrible. I’ve owned a lot of ikea furniture over the years, but this has definitely been the most frustrating ikea item I have ever built. They market it as so easy to put together, but if you mess up, good luck fixing it! After spending almost 2hours putting it together. My drawers are crooked and one doesn’t even latch properly. I don’t even want to hang it on my wall"
10305741,Kallax shelving. Very versatile - can set low or high direction - extremely sturdy - bought x2 and plan on purchasing x2 more in the near future!
20275814,perfectly usable and attractive. it is exactly as we imagined - very functional
80508504,Difficult to build. Difficult to build
59278307,Kallax. Love the shelves! Moved into an apartment which lacks storage area. This unit not only works as a TV unit but I also now have a lot more storage space and is much better looking than a TV unit!

40275846,"The BEST Storage!. I love my KALLAX! I have this one and and the double size. (2x4high) They replaced two other storage units and I still have more room!  The footprint is perfect for a smaller room, but you need storage. I love this system!  And it’s so light and easy to move around! Too notch!"

00388633,"Great Size, Looks Amazing!. Beautiful shelving unit. Not too large, very sturdy, open back is perfect for electronic (TV) cords, but have a “backstop” to keep books from falling off. Directions were pretty easy to follow. I purchased two and placed them side by side to help fill up a wall; they are exactly what I needed and expected. Recommended."
80275887,"Love these shelves!. These Kallax shelves are awesome! They are very well packaged and the 3 that I ordered which are 58” in length fit great in the back of my SUV with the back seat down. They were very easy to put together, just follow the directions. They’re lightweight but strong. I have them set up in my craft room and they look great. Highly recommend!"
80401292,Love it!. Only wish I'd bought more! I am a crafter and this is perfect for organizing!!!
80401292,"pretty good for what I needed. I used this to store Cricut roles of vinyl and it works pretty well. It was a little hard to slide in with the felt pieces attached but overall, I'm happy with it"
20275814,"Nice product. Not too hard to put together. However, the screws are visible upon completion. Should include little plastic caps to cover them."
00415599,"It’s great in the kids’ room. We use it for books, stuffies, toys. It’s very versatile and looks great!"
70342199,Great style!!!!. This is exactly what my kitchen needed for oversized appliances!!!

00275848,Chris R. Versatile product-bought for my craft organization
80275887,"Great functionality for all rooms. I really like the functionality, and ease of organization this piece offers. But the look of this piece of furniture is sub par. The holes where the screws go show on both sides, and ikea doesn’t offer anything to put over the screw holes. I even went back and asked if there was anything I could buy at ikea to cover the screw holes, and they referred me to go to Home Depot! Not good! It makes the over look of the piece look cheap and unfinished! That’s my only major complaint about the product."

20275814,Great storage option. We love the various size Kallaxs we've purchased. Great storage solutions. Love that you can also get wheels for these. Comes in handy when you like to rearrange furniture a lot.

00275848,. I am so happy with this unit!
60275812,Excellent value.. Purchased several months ago after looking at similar products elsewhere. Best product for the money. Assembly would have been easier with two people but manageable for one.
70342199,I really liked this shelf. I really liked this shelf unit. Was the style I was looking for!!
40275846,"Classic piece with lots of uses. We have several other Kallax pieces in our home and they're used as book shelves, display pieces. This single unit now houses all of our old record albums. Classic look, super easy to put together and looks great."
40334558,"Breaks easily, extremely difficult to assemble. I watched a video showing how to assemble this..I started with the piece labeled as 1as shown in the instructions. I did everything right..but the keyholes drilled into the wood have been drilled completely wrong and nothing fits right. The plastic pieces break right off. This new tool-less design by Ikea is AWFUL and they need to ditch this. I broke TWO of these in a row. STAY AWAY."
10275862,Love as is ❤. Love as is ❤
30275861,Kallax. Love this unit. Great storage
60221683,"Great shelving unit. The FJÄLKINGE shelving unit has a timeless quality, and its set-up is effortless. IKEA should consider offering the narrower version as well."
40275846,Great Shoe Shelf. I bought this in January and it’s been a great addition to my room. I use it to house my heeels and use it as a TV stand too but my TV is way too big for it! I love the height on it though. It doesn’t take up much firmer space at all!
50334591,I love it. It great for storing books
70339291,Totally love it. Totally love it
20275814,This was purchased for my. This was purchased for my daughter. She very much likes it.
10409932,"Always a good choice.. I have a small business puttering IKEA and other knock down furniture together. Hands down, I can always trust IKEA pieces to go together perfectly with really good instructions.  I love how different families customize the KALLAX series to suit their needs.  My teen son just did the same and his bedroom is 200% more organized now!"
70301537,"Easy peezy and sturdy. Been putting off this purchase and it couldn’t have gone any better between ordering and delivery! I am 64 female and was too excited to wait for help and put it together by myself in an hour. Hubby helped me lift it when he got home and I secured it easily to the wall. Where is where I take off a star, they show screws to use for the wall but don’t include them. Can’t understand why not."
00275848,"Kallax is a great system if you can find it in stock. The Kallax shelving system is perfect. Easy to assemble, well made, sturdy, and looks great. My only issue was trying to find what I wanted in stock. I wound up settling for colors that I didn't prefer. It is probably a pandemic supply issue so I understand. It was just frustrating."
20275814,Love the cubes!!. These are my go to storage solutions! Easy to assemble and very sturdy. Add the cubes and you have TONS of storage space.
19278328,Perfect. Exactly what I needed for my daughter’s bedroom.
89294532,Must Have. This shelf looks like a more expensive piece due to how sturdy and well made it is. It really changes the vibe of a room!
70301537,"Kallax. Love this unit, in fact I have several of them. If you have children, please anchor them. They are heavy and easy to put together."
00275848,Great Shelves - easy to assemble. Worked great for my laundry room - perfect height and not too wide. It was easy to put together and seems very sturdy.
80275887,This is what I was. This is what I was looking for and works as expected.
20213312,"Great. This shelve worked great for my son's collectibles. Very sturdy, nice looking, great price"
80275887,Excellent product!!. Excellent product!!
80275887,Works great for my teen. Works great for my teen son instead of a dresser to organize his clothes.
80275887,"Kallax Shelf. The Kallax shelf is really pretty once set up. The quality is ok, the shelf is light in weight but I think the price is a little pricey for the material it is made of."
50339292,Superb turntable stand. It's easy to miss in the photos but this is an ideal turntable stand. It's at an optimum height and the lower compartment is perfectly sized for LPs including those in slipcovers. With the other matching pieces it makes an excellent media system.  Note that you should use a right angle to insure proper alignment during assembly. There is enough play in all the holes that the unit can be assembled crooked and the doors will be out of alignment. Just wait until you have a second person and a builder's square to align it and do a final tightening of all the bolts (and there are quite a few!). Personally I like that the wood panels don't come pre-drilled for the wood screws. That allows you to pick whichever you think is the best side to face upward. These are real pine so knots are common. If you want more character put them on top. If you want a cleaner tech look then you can hide them.  This unit can be assembled without the doors if desired although you will probably want to use the screws to fill the holes. Since they're black you really don't notice them. We started with the doors off then added them to change up the look.
60275812,Durable and easy to put together. I found this for shelf bookcase easy to put together. It's very durable and I have two of them side by side. Strong enough to hold my stereo equipment and television.
80275887,"Great shelf. Purchased this item to expand a set I already own. As per my usual IKEA experience, easy to assemble, sufficient directions and all parts necessary for assembly."
40275846,Great value for the money. Great value for the money and matches well when added to same height shelves for a larger unit.
50334591,Perfect. My husband bought two to house his stereo equipment. They are simple and functional.
70342199,Great for audio. I purchased 2 of these and the matching cabinet with doors for a vintage audio rack. It works extremely well for that and all the shelves have enough separation for LPs.  Note that this unit does not align with the other two designs because it lacks a wood top for the lower shelves making them about 1/2in low.  These are made in China with the usual quality control problems. One of my units came with mud inside the plastic bag and a corner than hadn't been painted and was already rusting. Living more than an hour from Ikea... Also note that you should use a right angle to insure proper alignment during assembly. There is enough play in all the holes that the unit can be assembled crooked. Just wait until you have a second person and a builder's square to align it and do a final tightening of all the bolts (and there are quite a few!).
00275848,Great for storage. This is the best versatile storage system on the market. I use the unit with doors and without.
80303437,good for use. good for use
90286649,"Adds Style and Function!. I added two drawer inserts to my 4 KALLAX shelving unit. Great for storage, function and style."

60275812,Great buy. I bought a shelf unit for my kid and it was perfect for his room. We’re both happy and satisfied with product.
00275848,"Made a bookcase bed. I bought 3 of these, put them together and laid them on their side in a U shape ... for a bookcase bed. (I bought a piece of wood to lay across the top.) They are very sturdy."
20275814,Great shelving. Just what I. Great shelving. Just what I needed. I would recommend them.
80275887,Very Good!. I bought this two months ago. It was fairly easy to put together. Some pieces were a challenge to connect. Over all a nice shelf.
20275814,"Very sturdy!. I bought this a month ago. Didn't take long to assemble; fits in small area. Can be used for books, big toys, electronics."

40275846,Kallax is a Keeper!. We moved into new house and are having to reconfigure our setup… this piece we got recently is helping us to maximize our space and it’s a keeper!
00275848,Wonderful unit. This is a nice solid unit that I ended up putting together myself in under an hour... let my husband nap! Great buy!!
40275846,"Nothing new. Cube storage. Same as it's always been, got exactly what I expected to."
20278167,"Nice looking but not as functional. These shrink the size of the kallax opening so the cute bins, etc. Don't fit. I wish they would bring back the light wood color."
70301542,"Exactly what I needed. Needed sturdy affordable shelving to store board games. Kallax shelf was a perfect storage solution. It actually fit perfectly in a wide closet. The black-brown is more black than brown, but it still looks good. Assembly took a little while but that's to be expected with all the pieces. The finished shelf is a little wobbly, so you will probably want to use the included wall anchor to keep it sturdy."
10409932,Love it. Love it
10345073,Hanging basket. the helps me to add papers and mail to the storage unit. It's great.
70339291,Perfect for what I needed. Bought another. Let me start by saying always do your measurements but it was perfect and solid contribution for our dining room. And it was on sale so I bought another.
70332124,"Ruined my Life. I had the misfortune of buying two of these cabinets and my life has been downhill ever since. It all started when I looked around my room and deiced I paid to much for these walls to not be in use but then I looked at my wallet so the only choice I had was to buy two of these monsters. I got the product today and as i tried to put the pieces together the devil smiled as he saw that it would not connect properly and line up I used a hammer and the white layer started to pop up from the cabinet I kept going until I got to cabinet number two as I did the devil began to cackle. One of the layers didn't have a piece go in fully so I thought I be able to remove it and redo it, nope the wood that's meant to attach the two pieces together BROKEN, I think okay i can send it back and only have one cabinet but no for you see I had been tricked into thinking free returns would apply to the website too but no so now I have a unfinished cabinet lying on my bedroom floor. Would Recommend to someone at work that you hate."
99017186,"Uneven Doors. Assembling the doors was the most challenging, getting them to line up is not easy. As a result, the doors have different spaces around them, and they look uneven."
50339292,"Love!!. Super sturdy, adds a nice touch to the kids living room"
40415601,Display/storage corner. Love it
00388633,Nice surprise. We bought it to fit in a small space to create storage for linens and towels. Did not realize that it was solid pine until we open packaging. Nice set of shelves and a perfect fit in the bathroom. Would be nice to have door options available but getting baskets for the bottom shelves still work for what we need Would definitely purchase again.
20275885,It was what I was. It was what I was looking for
80303437,These shelves are so pretty!. I bought two of these shelves for my office and I’m glad I did! I also have some in my kitchen! I always get lots of compliments on these shelves!

40415601,Great for comic books!. I was specifically looking for a shelving unit for my comic books because they’re just too heavy for regular shelves. They fit perfectly in the compartments and are well supported. Easy to put together too.
90286649,"fancy drawers. This was easy to install, and they look great. Had I known this was so easy, I might not have bought a malm, and just made a dresser with these. However, it should be noted that I have made almost every Kallax and have built a lot of IKEA furniture."
80275887,a Easy to put together.. a Easy to put together. Surprisingly lightweight yet holds a lot of heavy books.
80275887,"Kallax Bookshelf. Great! very sturdy, and roomy. Plenty of space for trinkets and all my recipe books. I just got a few linen boxes to us for organization. I plan to get another one for my sewing room."

39329384,Great Idea—Little Pricey—Bad Drawers. I bought four of these EKET with drawers. I put one together & hated it. The drawers sliders were stiff & their alignment was a bit off—and not on my account. I ended up retuning all four of them. Went in a different direction.
99017186,"Perfect!. I have bought similar, cube storage units from other retailers in the past, but they were flimsy and fell apart after a short while. This Kallax feels like it will last forever."
80275887,Easy to Put Together!. Needed more shelfing in my sewing room and this was perfect! Smooth surface to lay fabrics on plus great size all together!!!

70339291,"Pretty good. Looks nice, was easy to assemble, and it is perfect for storing stuff. I use it to store my Costco purchases. I would recomend anchoring it to the wall if you have kids, because they like climbing on stuff, otherwise it's perfect as is.

80275887,Cubby. I bought this for my daughters sewing room and its absolutely great
00275848,Extremely happy. I was extremely happy with this purchase. Wonderful bookcase. Instructions were easy to follow. Thanks for keeping prices reasonable.
00275848,High Quality…Assemble as Directed. This is an awesome ikea item and super high quality. Definitely need to tap the pegs into the holes with a hammer not like box store ones where you just insert them. Otherwise item won’t fit together properly. I think this speaks to the superior quality of this product vs. big box stores. Hangs on wall great and looks awesome with accessorizing storage totes from ikea.
99932540,perfect shelves. we drove three hours to pick up one of the last sets of drawers in our area (there were also very few shelves left) and it was totally worth it! we shopped around all over for something modern with thin profiles but sturdy (steel shelves with honeycomb center!) and these are absolutely perfect. fingers crossed that they continue to offer these because i would love a few more!
10409932,Kallax Units. Wonderful product! Easy to assemble! Have these all over the house. I did not need to anchor any of them to the wall. White brightens up the room.

00415599,White Kallax Shelves. These shelves are perfect! I bought the 9 cubbie and the 4 cubbie and put them side by side in my closet. They look so nice and professional. They provide so much extra storage. I will probably buy more for the upstairs closet as well. I hired the Task Rabbit to put them together and that was a great experience. Thank you IKEA for such a nice product.

79278269,"Perfect for 12”vinyl albums. If you want a great shelf to store your albums, look no further. These are the best."
90286649,Great handy light stand. I bought the 2 cube kallax and added drawers to replace my old nightstand. It's a great height since my bed is very high and the drawers were a great addition. They are very smooth and work great!
20275885,Just what I needed. Needed some inexpensive shelving that did not look cheap. They were just what i was looking for.
60275812,Classic but a goody. I love the kallax line. They're so easy to assemble and they're sturdy. I have multiple of these and use them for all kinds of storage. I do wish there were better options for the inserts or drawers you can put in them.
70339291,Nice Shelf!. Nice Shelf. Looks great and is sturdy! Perfect for my office.
40415601,Stylish Bookshelf. Perfect for oversized books.
80275887,Great storage. They keep our room organize and clutter free.
50481172,"Smaller than expected. It’s not a bad shelf, just smaller than I expected it to be. I’m 5’2 and it comes to about my chest. I also didn’t like the all metal look to it in my space."
60278170,Easy to install. Easy to install
10409932,Kallax white. The unit was very easy to put together. Perfect for my daughter’s Funko Pops display!
40275846,This is what I was. This is what I was needed
60275812,"Quick, easy and neat storage.. Combined with the DRÖNA, this unit makes a convenient storage unit for larger items. I have used the KALLAX system in my home office and to clean up a cluttered utility room."
70286645,"Slight color variation. If you are installing these in kallax units that are a couple of years old, you may have a slight color variation from the original. I have my unit in my bedroom, so it doesn't bother me but I can see how some people would dislike this. Only rated the appearance a 4 because of this. Loved the function of the drawers!"
10409932,Works perfectly and just as. Works perfectly and just as expected to store all my paper crafting supplies.
40346924,Perfect replacements for large bulky dressers. We have a pretty small living space in our bedrooms. For years we have been using old hand-me-down bully dressers that left little room for anything else in our small bedroom. These cube storage cases solved our issues and offered more drawer space than our old dressers.
40275846,Amazing shelf.. I used this and the 2 tier kallax in my mud room area and I wish I could submit a picture. It came out amazing. Love the product and pricing :-) Thank you!!!

20409936,"another win for IKEA. We have the older Expedit ( probably 15 years old and still going strong) and are enjoying the Kallax just as much. It was easy to put together, and sturdy."
40275846,"Versatile storage but lacking inserts. I have A LOT of KALLAX in my house in various configurations as well as EKET storage but the one thing that I find crazy is the lack of the Glass door insert in the United States and the fact that the glass shelf insert does not fit inside the wooden door insert. Do better IKEA and take your products to the next level instead of making me have to modify them to fit their intended, logical purpose!"
60275812,This the third one to. This the third one to add to my space. Love them.   First one I bought 9 years ago and still looks as good as the beginning.
40423719,I love it. Works perfectly with my Kallax cubes.
90286649,"I wish the drawer sides. I wish the drawer sides would come up higher, they are several inches below the top edge of the drawer fronts. I use them to hold socks and underwear, and would love to not have to worry about them falling behind the drawer if it's too full."

10409932,Love it looks modern and. Love it looks modern and beautiful

30275861,Sew Perfect. Had to have the Kallax for my quilting studio to store fabric. Perfect choice. Assembly was easy - took about an hour with 2 of us as suggested. Everything screwed together with no problems. I added the Capita legs in white because the cabinet sits over an air vent. Leg assembly also easy. Made small pilot holes for the screws and they installed smoothly with a drill driver.
60275812,Solid. Not as nice as its predecessor—the name of which I don’t even remember! But solid nonetheless.
40275846,"Fit my LP collection perfectly!. I was thrilled that this sturdy KALLAX unit would support my heavy vintage audio equipment (used horizontally) AND fit 12"" LP's below. The length also allowed for three audio components across. It is the perfect solution for an audio rack."

70286645,Solid insert for Kallax. The insert was easy to assemble. The drawers are very sturdy.
80275887,"Multi-functional. So pleased that I chose the Kallax system. It can grow with my child and function in multiple ways. It can be a shelf or a toy storage for now, but change as she grows. For example, when she is older, we could place it vertically and have her choose her own ""accessories"" to match her needs. She can choose doors or drawers to make the cubbies into something totally different."

This is a solid effective piece of furniture - I use it as storage and as a step-system for my older cats trying to reach a window - the brackets and optional feet are a nice plus.

20278167,Great add-on for Kallax storage. Used a couple of these to add some hidden storage to the Kallax cube in our nursery. Very easy to install and adjust and our toddler has fun opening and closing the doors so there's unexpected entertainment value as well. And since these have a back panel I was able to hide cords behind them to keep our toddler from unplugging the things on top of the Kallax cube so these were perfect for our needs.

80275887,"I used it long ways. I used it long ways as a tv stand, it looks very nice in my living room"

40510863,Pink!!!. Love these in pink! Bought the red ones for my son last year and they are still perfectly hanging in the wall. Glad they came out with baby pink just in time for my daughters nursery! Make sure to order the wall bracket separately or you will have to make two trips to the store like me! Oops I always forget..
40346924,Love it!. This product is very light and very easy to put together. It can easily be done by one person. It fits well in the space we bought it for. My only complaint is that the brackets included to anchor it to the wall are not made for a shelf that sits against a wall with a baseboard. Even though I purchased very long screws and used drywall anchors it's not anchored to the wall very well.

20275885,Nice for the price. I decided to organize and create a smaller footprint for the toys the grandkids play with when they come over. This works great. The 13 by 13 cubes are very spacious.

Everything was shoved in closets and boxes, now I can access it all with room to spare."
89285820,Great storage!. I have these several places in the home because they are a simple storage solution. I'd like them even better if my IKEA had the gray colors available.

60275812,"The KALLAX, A vile invention.. The vicious cycle of a life in search of monetary gain, quite similar to an ikea shelving unit indeed. we may try to fight, rebel, revolt; Yet no one can escape the sleek modern yet industrial look of the KALLAX. So common among homes, so popular among affordable yet stylized storage. Not unlike the ruthless, oppressive system that is capitalism.   When one first encounters the KALLAX, they are paralized, so mesmerizing, a truly eldritch evil. A man-made horror beyond any entity's comprehension. This experience is one in the same with capitalism. From a young age we are taught to worship the 1%. We are taught that to be rich is the only success one can have in life just as we are taught that the KALLAX is truly the peak of modern design. Capitalism envelops and destroys all. But we need to revolt! We need to fight against the man! We need to destroy all KALLAX!   Pretty simple but sturdy design, 2.5 out of 5 stars."

I’ve never done that step on an ikea product and I hope that’s the last time. It was very difficult and took a lot of force.  Overall the finished product is great. Love the two drawers and that it’s off the floor. So easy to vacuum. But the drawer openers are touchy. You have to press right in the center or they will misalign and not open or close properly

I'm using it as an end piece for my IKEA Vallentuna sleeper sofa because it fits perfectly, and the glass middle shelf lets light get to the bottom shelf, where I have some ceramic decorations.  The only thing is that because it was As Is, there's permanent marker on it with some identification info, which I wish the employee hadn't done because it won't come off, though that's not an issue with this product specifically."

60333954,"EKET AMAZING ENGINEERING. EKET AMAZING ENGINEERING. As we assembled these cubes, I kept saying the engineering is amazing. Such an improvement over past experiences from 15 years ago. High quality. Looks great. Very functional."
10409932,Great Closet Storage. I've been using Kallax cubes to store my clothes for several years and really love them. They allowed me to get rid of my dresser and I like Kallax cubes much better.
20278167,Good product. Good product
70286645,"Best assembly I’ve done. Probably the easiest IKEA item to put together, works well and price wasn’t outrageous"
70342199,Love it!. Love it!
30275861,Kallax Shelves. These worked out really well in our bathroom.
70301537,"Great shelf for a playroom. We needed a big shelf for my sons playroom and this was perfect. Glad we went with this size and there is plenty of room to store items on top. Definitely need 2 people to stand it up one its assembled, but one person can easily assemble it on the ground. Happily surprised to see you could take it apart if you needed to move since its only held in by dowels and the screws. Fairly straighforward assembly and design."
80275887,Best Closet Organizer. Beyond happy with my purchase! It fit perfectly in my closet to organize all my clothes I previously had on wire racks. I additionally purchased the DRÖNA bins that can fit inside the squares to put my clothes so it looks neat.
70286645,"Great value!. I bought the Kallax 5x5 unit for my quilting supplies. The “cubbies” are perfect for most items, but I found I need space for smaller things — these are perfect! Easy to assemble, good price, enough space, and they look great. Ordering online and picking up in the store made it even easier!"
70342199,"Love the entire FJÄLLBO product line. I wanted furniture that would compliment my home office space. Something that would fit the masculine/stylish/classic look. This shelf was super easy to put together, and it's just the right side needed for the space I have many pieces from this line, but the one I need to complete my home office hasn't been in stock in months."
20275885,Kallax bookcase. I love the kallax I now have 5 of them or maybe 6???
20275885,"Ikea changes Expedit dimensions to meet new eco goals. As an owner of several Expedit shelving unit I thought those were marvelously cost efficient and sturdy units. I finally had to break down and buy the smaller Kallax units when the need for new storage arose. The Kallax is basically a slightly smaller exterior dimension version of the Expeditor with the same interior storage shelf dimensions. However, the new units feel distinctly less robust and the exterior finish cladding also seems a bit cheaper looking. I understand that Ikea will save considerable wood product given the enormous volume of Kallax that they sell worldwide, but I still lament the passing of the better quality Expedit."
20275885,Gift well received. Great color great size decent price
70286645,Great for customizing my Kallax unit. I love the versatility this adds to the Kallax shelf - I can customize to suit my needs and make the shelf even better
20275814,So worth the price!. So worth the price!
80275887,Excellent. Excellent durability and quality! Easy to assemble and so practical to use for decorative needs or for a kids' playroom. Thick and very nice color. The price-performance ratio (bang for the buck) is very good here. Very satisfied!
50339292,Purchased for my son's first. Purchased for my son's first apartment. Looks great under his wall mounted TV.

20275814,Just right. Easy assembly. Made well. Good value for price.
19386101,"Record Storage Cabinet. Surprisingly easy to be put together, they look great and met my purpose of record storage and Stereo stand."
90286649,Kallax Inserts quasi-Rock. I love the new Kallax inserts for providing hidden storage but what I dislike is that they need to be held in place by being drilled into the Kallax.
09189200,Perfect for a doll-house apartment complex. My daughter and I used Eket to make a doll-house apartment complex. The pieces are sturdy enough for play and stable enough for the occasional mishap. I'm optimistic that these pieces will grow with her past the doll-house phase. Assembly was a bit more tedious than the usual ikea build.
70483274,Love this shelving. Love this unit has so many options. Easy to put together and it’s very sturdy and strong
80275887,"Love It. Exactly what we were looking for. Easy to assemble, very sturdy. Nice addition to the bedroom for extra storage."
50305739,"Furniture and all other stuff. Furniture and all other stuff is affordable and it saves us money. Installation is easy as 1, 2, 3."
20275814,Good - Would buy again.. Good - Would buy again.
20275814,The product is great. Assembly. The product is great. Assembly was a bit of a challenge as the holes didn't line up for the final screws. We had to take it apart and shorten the dowels to get the final holes to line up. It was fine after that.
40423719,Fits great and worth the wait!. So useful for sorting mail etc. worth the two month wait for it to come back in stock
70301537,Large cube unit. Really helps with organization
40415192,"super easy to assemble, all. super easy to assemble, all wood product no particle board, great quality would totally recommend this product. great quality and great price."

29278304,Now my room looks complete!. Now my room looks complete!
20275814,"Perfect for my needs. Affordable, easy to assemble. I stuck 2 together and added casters on bottom and 2 Lacks on top to use as a cutting table with storage in my sewing room."
60275812,Perfect. I love all of my kallax pieces.
30275861,Used this in my laundry. Used this in my laundry room work out just fine

00275848,Easy to put together. Easy to put together
70342199,assembly was difficult because of. assembly was difficult because of poor instructions. do more to identify small nuances where parts are one sided
00275848,Awesome shelf. This shelf is amazing in my craft room! It was easy to assemble as well.
00275848,"Great Stuff!. Versatile and sturdy, this is a great product. We bought two for our home office/workroom and they were perfect (we mounted them horizontally on the wall). Because of the ability to mount in different orientations, stand or stack on the floor there are a lot of applications we can think of for these. It's VERY likely that we will buy a few more."
20409936,"Easy and Helpful. The Kallax was very easy to put together. It fits our space perfectly and has tones of storage for books, odds and ins when using the baskets."
60333954,"Poor Design. I like IKEA. I have liked all of their furniture... until now. The single EKET squares are good and solid. This? This divided square has, maybe, half the structural integrity of a single square."
40275846,great for storing fabric. I'm a crafter and use these shelves to sort my fabric.
40415601,Holds up to kids!. Sturdy and super easy to assemble
00275848,Nice but the details..... Looks good except there are no stickers to cover the screws and cams holding it together. Also wish the long sides weren't 1/16th of an inch lower than the short sides when assembled.
00275848,Art Room Storage. These KALLEX pieces are absolutely the best for my art Studio. I have bought many pieces and they all fit nicely together for extra space when the largest piece just isn’t enough. We stacked them on top of the 5 x 5 KALLAX. They’re a perfect match.
00275848,Product as advertised. Product as advertised
00415599,Love it!. Perfect craftroom storage!
70301537,"Kallax big shelf wobbles a bit. The cubicles are nice. The frame could use some sort of diagonal reinforcement.  The wall attachments help, but when you are tilting it up after building or manoeuvring it into position, it can tilt side to side a bit, even with the screws torqued tight."
50481172,Great little shelf. Easy to assemble. Sturdy. Like the slim profile. Great addition to my craft room.
99017186,Love it!. Quick to assemble and is nice and sturdy.
20275885,Great product for the price.. Great product but would like to see more options for elevated base.
20275814,Perfect for my Craftroom!. Exactly what I needed to add to my craftroom for additional storage of things.
20275814,Perfect. Easy to assemble. Perfect for keepsakes and sewing related items!
70286645,"A great drawer for my Kallax. I purchased these to go into my Kallax and they were easy to put together and install. I didn't know these were actually screwed into the shelf unit until was putting them together. It wasn't difficult to screw them in. Also, make sure your Kallax is square or else you might have issues installing them in the shelf unit."
20275885,"Great product. They go together easily, look great, sturdy and functional."
10305741,"Love!. I wasn’t so sure about the white gloss finish, but I absolutely love this look! I use for my craft room and craft storage and it fits everything I need plus more!"
70286645,"Wish I could rate it higher, but. I have purchased several Kallax 2x2 over the years. Each one similar in quality and ease of assembly. However, I felt the shelf space did not function for me as it always seem to have at least half of dead space. I saw the drawer product and I thought, I could make better use of the shelf space within my 2x2. I purchased 2 units (4 drawers total) after much online review. After installing the first shelf insert, i noticed the spacing was off by 1/4"" inch - not enough to affect the functionality, but enough to bother me seeing a slanted gap. I thought maybe I installed wrong (how could I, it's IKEA instructions). I installed the second insert and same thing. I thought maybe my original shelf build was off, but I checked it with a speed square - it was was ""square"" meaning good. I checked the insert and it turned out that the shelf railings were off by a few mm enough to cause a gap after install. Would I buy again? Maybe? Would I recommend? No for now. I will live with the small gap for now. Frustrating tho."
20275814,Perfect for my purpose.. Simple and straight forward assembly. Sturdy and nice quality. Went back and bought a second one.
60333954,Horrible design!. It is a nightmare to assemble this product. It's almost impossible to assemble this whithout having at least one crack on the product. I bought two of these and want to return them even if it takes two hour drive to get there. I have never had assembling issue with IKEA products before.
60275812,"Perfect For My Vinyl Record Collection. Love the KALLAX line. Have several pieces. Extremely easy to assemble, very affordable and easy on the eyes."
80487813,I needed some sort of. I needed some sort of shelves for my laundry room. This was exactly what I was looking for. It holds all my laundry accouterments and fits perfectly in my laundry room. I was so happy when I found this and am so totally satisfied with it. Thank you.
00415599,"I recently bought the 3x3. I recently bought the 3x3 Kallax unit to complete an empty corner in my Craft Room, which also contains a 5x5 Kallax Unit. The Kallax system is versatile, easy to assemble, provides a wealth of storage in an attractive display. Love the Kallax cubes!!"

80275887,Good product. I’m using it. Good product. I’m using it for closet storage.
20409936,Cheap but effective. Very cheap material make sure not to overload it or Crack the outside material because there is cardboard internal material. Other than that lots of storage and easy to assemble. Would recommend
49285817,Good. Good
80275887,"Alternative Uses. Daughter saw it on TikTok to use these shelves to make a bunk bed with it, so she could put LED lights around it and be able to make use underneath as another space for a bed or hang out."
40275846,Makes a nice little record. Makes a nice little record player station
40415601,Kallax shelf. Disappointed with lack of inserts for Black-Brown Kallax vs. White Kallax. At least 4-5 inserts only in white. Also Kallax stand is only in white.
20275885,Great bookcase. Solid construction and deep shelves for larger books.
20275814,Great product. Great product

90286649,Small drawers. Work as expected. A little small
60333954,ultimate garbage piece of furniture. This is beyond garbage. Cheaply done and impossible to put together. Not to mention dangerous when you try to slide and adjust the sides. I ended up with bruised palm of my hand. Don't buy!!
80275887,Organization Necessity. Good for organizing and storage
70286645,Came with the wrong instructions. Disappointed. Had the wrong instructions so they still are not built.
90495695,Beautiful and easy to assemble. Really easy to assemble. No tools needed. Looks great in the kallax shelving unit
10409932,"Love it. I love how versatile these are. I swear I have one in every size! They are being used as a dress, toy storage, craft storage, laundry room storage, everything! And with all the add on pieces you could do just about anything with these!"
20423720,Kallax Shelf Insert. Absolutely love my Kallax shelf insert. It's a great addition to a great bookcase.

10305741,🙌🏼👍. 🙌🏼👍
70342199,Perfect for a Record Stand. I bought this for my record player and I love it! I was able to put my records on another shelf. I love the look of it!
20275814,i was surprisingly hard to. i was surprisingly hard to assembly. For some reason we had more trouble assembling this than the other more complex furniture
20278167,"Nice addition. Looks great, easy to install with a little help from a drill."
70301537,"Awesome Storage. I watched a YouTuber build it by herself mostly and got motivated I was able to do the same just called over a helping hand to lift it. It was an easy build its sturdy and works well for me! I am using the first 3 bottom rows for my 3 boys toys storage. I got some plastic basket/bins from Target they fit perfectly. The top 2 rows are for my homeschooling supplies! I am so happy with this purchase Everytime I walk past it I feel happy it's an organized ""home"" for our things that's helped me consolidate 3 other storage items I had been using."
20275814,"Salon Furniture. Needed a shelf that worked for storage and a usable top space. Has options to make closed cabinets and shelves to hold retail. Great product, made well and sustainably. Also a quarter of the price of actual salon furniture."
60278170,Keeps the dust out. Hides the storage and keeps the dust to a minimum
70301537,"Poorly designed. This looks great, but is held together by wooden dowels. I’ve put together a ton of IKEA furniture and this is the most poorly constructed piece. There are gaps and it is not very sturdy if it is not attached to a wall. The attachment pieces were included, but not the screws. If I lived closer to the store (2hrs+ away) I think I’d return it."
80508504,Doesn't Fit. Anybody know if they changed the size of the Kallax shelves in the past year or so?  I got my Kallax shelf unit about a year ago and just got this insert today as well as the other little cat house one and neither of them fit in the square of my shelf.
20409936,Great item with affordable price. Great item with affordable price
20275885,"Great quality!. Loving my new Kallax! We're using a variety of them in our bedroom for dresser storage. There are so many different configurations, they work in any size room!"
80275887,"Love love love. I own several of these “cubicles” they are used differently throughout my house, my son’s apartment and the church nursery. They are perfect with so many options!!!"
20278167,Love it. Love it

20409936,Excellent. Very practice
10275862,Great Value for the price. I put two of this Kallax shelf together and created a minimalist luxe look. It's well-built and easy to put together.
20275814,"Cubic Storage. Love Kallax storage units, solid pieces of furniture."
80275887,Great for kids playroom to. Great for kids playroom to store books and toys.
60333954,"Do not buy!. Worst piece of furniture I have bought! Terrible to put together, cheaply made. The parts do not fit together and boards break!"
20275814,Nice. Nice
10305741,Perfect. Ideal for storage and practicality.
10409932,Easy assembly. Clean design.. Easy assembly. Clean design.
60278170,"Kallax doors provide a finishing touch. These doors finish a reinvisioning of my living room with a handsome way to take advantage of the full interior of the cubes and hide my photo albums, oh-so neatly!"
40415601,Love it. Love it
10275862,"Good product a little difficult to assemble. Good product a little difficult to assemble. Not all of the pieces fit together quite as perfectly as I wanted, but nothing that doesn’t look great in my space. I will be buying at least one more of these because the quality for price is there."

80275887,Great value. Great value
20275814,Nice products. Easy to assemble and very stable.
20275885,Love them!. They are so easy to put together. I use them for just about everything!!!  TV entertainment center! Dressers! Extra storage in the kitchen! (Microwave sit perfectly on top and instapots fit perfectly in the cubes! So does my air fryer!)
60275812,Just what we were looking for!. Perfect!!
90286649,Perfect addition to our walk in closet. This insert is a great addition to our walk in closet remodel. The drawers glide smoothly and provide added space for small storage.
10275862,Very good for the price. You get what you pay for and this works perfectly
50339292,Great. I love this industrial style. No complaints except the wood is a little darker than pictured.
20275814,Love this.. I have bought several. Very easy to put together.
60275812,"We have 5 Kallax units so far - all serving a different purpose. It's versatile, easy to assemble, strong, ""Classic Ikea"" - did I mention versatile?!? Great for organizing kid's toys in a way that it sophisticated and durable."
70339291,excelent shelf space!. i have it in my room and its so space concious and easy to build :D very sturdy!
70342199,Great look for any room. Great look for any room to add the industrial look!
90286649,"Easy to assemble. And hold. Easy to assemble. And hold more than I expected. Turned an 11 year old shelf into something new with the drawers.  Please note - you do have to screw in the insert, so they are permanent."
60278170,"These were not as great. These were not as great as I wanted them to be. As with the drawers, which I love. These also have to be screwed into the shelves and are permanent"
40275846,"So many uses!. I have many of the Kallax of different sizes in our house. It is great that with the addition of doors or drawers and new hardware you can make it fit into so many different styles and uses!! I do wish that there were more insert options in the colors other than white, or the abiltiy to have a door that will cover 2 squares at once, but other than that this is great!"
20275885,"Just what I was looking for. I was looking for a way to store the various bits and pieces for different projects I am working on in my studio. My usual method was to have a pile somewhere, and add to that pile. Of course, the piles would spill into each other, and eventually became more knitting projects pile and sewing projects pile instead of Knitting Project for Customer A, Knitting Project for Customer B, Sewing Project for Customer C, Sewing project for Customer D. I also wanted a low credenza-like shelf to add work surfaces to the studio, as well. Other, similar products from other companies looked the same online, but were considerably smaller in dimensions. When turned on its side, the KALLAX is a nice height at 30 inches. The whole unit is very heavy, strong, and sturdy. I am very pleased with it.  As far as how well it works for my original needs: I can now see, at a glance, each project and its materials. When new pieces (fabric orders, button orders, new patterns) come in, I can just toss each item into its appropriate cubby, and it is not in danger of intermingling with other projects or getting lost somewhere special where I put it so I wouldn't misplace it. (You know how that goes.) Additionally, the top of the unit turned out to work very nicely as a place to mount my yarn swift, yardage gauge, baller, and scale, resulting in a very effective yarn winding station that remains out of my way, even while set up. The flat-packed package did require two people to move (as, I assume, will the final piece of furniture), but I was able to assemble it easily by myself. Everything turned out nicely square and solid.  I bought the black-brown finish. My studio has a black and white motif, and though this is not a true black, it is close enough to blend nicely with the rest of the room. It really looks more like a wood with a black stain (there is a wood-grain pattern to the finish). The unit is not solid wood, but a composite wood product, but the finish looks very wood-like."
20275814,"perfect inside closet. I have bought three and would fill my house with them!!! the cats love the compartments, the towels and sheets fit, the 12x12"" storage bins fit perfectly for the smaller items. excellent storage. great price."
10275862,"Always a good choice. We’ve owned several of the Kallax storage cube units in different configurations and have been very satisfied with the quality every time. This size is perfect for storing a lot of books, which was the intended use. You can actually double up if needed (which we did). Very happy with this purchase"
80275887,I love. I love it because I can select the different colored boxes for my children
40275846,"Solid shelf, great size, terrific. Solid shelf, great size, terrific value"
79278250,Sturdy cubes. The Kallax is easy to put together and is sturdier than the box store cubes. Doors and drawers are easy to add to give it a finished look plus hide storage.
10275862,"Great addition for play storage. This is a great addition to store toys and books in our play area for the kids. The unit is easy to assemble, looks great, and is sturdy. I will be adding some of the customizable options for cubes (doors/shelves) when they are in stock!"
20275885,Great product and value. Great product and value
80275887,Love this!. I love the quality of this. It was relatively easy to assemble and it’s solid. Great value and definitely recommend. The only thing that I might like to see would be an option for a back to enclose the compartments to use as a cubby system instead of shelves. I like these better than other bookshelves because they don’t wobble when put together.
70339291,Good purchase. I love it.
80275887,Kallax. This shelving unit is perfect for my sewing projects!!!
00314642,"Kallax Drawer. This is a great addition to adding to your bookshelves for the very little items. Not sturdy. Be careful when putting together, screwed right through the front of the drawer."
20423720,Coffee cups!. I have this in my kitchen next to my kcup and it helps to double stack my fun coffee cups. So no more wasted space :)
70342199,Excellent!!!. Sturdier than I expected! Rock solid!!
20278167,"Love the look. Instructions a little difficult, but once I figured it out it turned out well. Finishes the look of my shelves"
70301542,"Need another one!. This is great for my record collection, but these are difficult tlo find."
20278167,"Hard to align well. It is easy to install but hard to align well if you drilled the hole on the shelf a little off, you are unable to make the door look perfect unless re-drill the hole. I have tried to adjust the screws as the connector gives some adjustable range but the door ends up to be either hitting the bottom or not able to be closed entirely. Initially was thinking to install 2 doors now I don't wanna take a risk to screw the other cub."
60275812,Easy install. I purchased this to be used inside my closet. I assembled it myself without difficulty. The materials are light but sturdy when assembled. Would buy another one.
70332124,needs met. perfect for my application
40275846,"Stand up shelf. Love this shelf. It has large square openings, is thick and looks more expensive than it was."
89386107,Not as straightforward to assemble as in the photos.. I have been used to intuitive and error-free procedures for IKEA furniture and this at first look seems easy and straightforward. Only it is not because if you kind of mix the order of putting the sides together which is easy to do as they all seem the same then the pieces don't fit and you have to force them apart and start over. Not a particularly fun thing to do with connections relying on a rather flimsy piece of particleboard.
00415599,I am happy with this. I am happy with this new shelf
20275814,"Great storage, sleek look. I love IKEA’s Kallax furniture. It is very reasonably priced, looks good and functions well."
20275814,We love this for storage. We love this for storage for our kiddo. It helps keep things semi organized
10487816,Was exactly what a was. Was exactly what a was looking for and affordable.
20275814,Great product. I bought this and the baskets to fit inside. This is a great product
70286645,"Pleasantly surprised. I was skeptical about purchasing these drawers. I could not find the inside dimensions of the drawer to ensure that my items would fit. I was pleasantly surprised at how much you can store in one of these drawers. The inside dimension of the drawer is 10 ¾” wide and 12” in length. The side of the drawer is only 2 ¾” high, but the overall height of the drawer is 5 3/8”. One drawer holds all my Crystal Nuvo drops (60 plus bottles) and some sprays. I can also get 14 plastic 4x6 cases in one drawer (arranged in a specific order). I have not attached sides of the drawers to the Kallax, so they do move a little when you open the drawer."
80334603,"Not recommended for records. I assumed from the pictures and dimensions that this would be a good fit for vinyl records, but it's such a tight fit that it's impractical. Vinyl sleeves ostensibly do fit, but any records that are slightly too tall have to be squeezed in, and the records are hard to get out. The cubes are also tedious to assemble because you have to slide the dowels into place. Fortunately, returning them in person was a painless process. Despite all that, I'd still recommend this product, so long as you use them for books or something other than records. And as always with IKEA, it's a good value."
10305741,Love it. Really keeps my stuff organized. I bought one 10 years ago and I just bought my second one 3 weeks ago. Really love the depth- can fold and place jeans and bulky/ messy clothes like bathing suits in this.
40415601,Small shelving. It’s nice and work will for displaying or for storage of books
60278170,"Don't Expect this to be like the original Expedit Doors. I loved the Expedit doors that you could slide in and out and re-position (you decide that your shelves should be in another room? You want to flip it on its' side? Easy! Just pull the doors out and flip them 90*!)  Now, the doors look nice from the outside but are so poorly made that the only way for them to have any structural integrity is to drill them into the sides of the shelf as outlined in the new instructions. No longer removable/repositionable without destroying your Kallax shelf from drilling multiple holes and if you ever decide you want to remove the doors to just have an open bookshelf, you'll be stuck with a ton of unsightly drill holes on the inside.   I bought four expecting them to be like the original ""slide in, slide out"" doors and after I opened the first one I realized how different they are now. I'll be returning the items I can."
20275814,Great for storage!. Great for storage!
20275885,"Can't beat this price. Outstanding piece of modern furniture for affordable price. Remember you can add cube inserts for storage.  Installation is easy. Will need a soft hammer, mallet to push wooden dowels in and pieces together. BTW I used wood glue for extra strength. Not required but if you move often, it will help. Overall, pretty happy with it."
80275887,Very sturdy and roomy. We bought this to use in the making of my cutting table in my sewing studio and am so pleased! I wish I could show you a photo of the completed project!
60275812,"Sturdy. This was a gift to my sister. I helped her put it together and it was super easy. After over a year, she asked for another one for her birthday to stack the two."
30275861,"Love the kallax shape, challenging setup. I really enjoy the sleek and simple look of the kallax. My only complaint is that assembly of the bottom and top of the shelving unit was incredibly challenging. I suggest having a second set of hands. All in all, happy with my purchase."
60275812,"Great for Scrapbook Organization. This 4 box Kallax unit is very sturdy and is being used to house scrapbook supplies. The 12 x 12 albums fit into the squares, and supply bins also fit 2 to a square. The shelf was easy to put together and looks great."
20275814,Love it and easy to. Love it and easy to install !
20275814,"Easy to assemble, and looks great!. This classsic is such a great value for the money. It is easy to assemble and looks so much nicer than the thinner alternatives."
40303439,Love it!. This is great for displaying collectibles. Next time I go to buy more shelving I will pick up another one for sure!
10409932,Kallax 3 x 4 Cube Shelves. Very sturdy and easy to assemble.
40346924,I have many of the. I have many of the Dallas shelving units. Always a quality product
00388633,I really like the look. I really like the look and design of the Havsta pieces...I have several things in different parts of the house.
19386101,Not good. Not good
89386107,Just what I expected.. Just what I expected.
39285827,Love this!. This is a great display box! Used it with the glass door and without. Very easy to put together
00334536,Just what I needed.... Didn't know it existed when I went shopping but it works for me. I topped it with four separate Eket boxes.
19278253,Easy to assemble. Looks beautiful and fits perfectly for what we needed.
40415601,"I’ve always like the IKEA. I’ve always like the IKEA cubes, and this one is no different. Looks good and is very sturdy."
00275848,I love the Kallax it's. I love the Kallax it's super easy to put together. We put legs on it so it's off the floor looks very nice. My only request is that it would be nice for that particular model to have the high gloss which it does not. I'm hoping soon they will do that. Great product for the money.
10409932,I like the options available.. I am enjoying the options available to change the look.
20423720,"Nice add-on for Kallax. This is a great little add-on for the Kallax unit. Goes together real easy with 4 shelf pins. There are 4 felt strips with adhesive backing that you put on the two side panels, and then the insert just slides into place. The side panels are approx. 1/4"" thick, and the center shelf is approx. 1/2"" thick. I only had one issue where one of my Kallax cubbies was a little off (probably my fault in the original construction) and I had to tap the side of the insert pretty hard to get it in the space."
70286645,"Not the same as before. I have bought five of these in the past and love the way they look and how they last. I just bought two new ones today and am very disappointed they switched out the wood sides for paper. The drawers are still wood, but the sides that support the drawers are paper and I have concerns they will tear/break down under the weight of the drawers contents. I am going to try to return these, despite Ikea's reluctance to take things back. Hey Kallax, bring back the high quality wood inserts, all wood, no paper sides, thank you!"
60275812,"Perfect for our house!. We bought this because we had too many shoes, bags and other items piling up by the front door. This allows us to keep everything nice and neat, tucked away in little baskets and even gave us room to display a few picture frames."
60275812,"Easy to put together. It is a great shelf, it is sturdy, love the color! I use it to organize my kids school work and books. It is just big enough to be useful, but not too big to be in the way"
20275885,Kallax. Great product!!
00275848,Kallax Review. I like the shelving system
10409932,Love it!. Exactly what I was looking for. This product was also super easy and intuitive to assemble and I love the customizable options that Kallax storage shelves offer. I will be purchasing more shelves in the near future.
00415599,"Love it. I love it. Its affordable, easy to put together, and great for storage"
99017445,Matches my Malm bedroom set. Love this unit. Lightweight and easy to assemble
89278297,Love it!. Love it!
60275812,Kallax was the perfect solution. I was looking for a way to get my kids' soccer gear organized and Kallax has solved the problem. I popped a couple of Drona cubes in the top sections for their uniforms and the open bottom sections are for their shoes/cleats.
70332124,"Eket System. For my Eket purchases, I’ve stuck to buying white, combining it with pieces from either white Kallax or Besta. It has worked out well in two rooms in my home.   In the smaller room there are tight spaces, a large, low window, some lower ceilings, and unexpected corners. The smaller scale of the taller Eket one- and two-door cabinets, some stacked, some not stacked, on two walls, has been combined with a run of low, white Kallax units on the other two walls.   Putting together that room, I found Eket offers many more options and combinations for storage and stylistics in small spaces, compared to larger or old-style furniture systems.   Related to sense of space, the scale and simplicity of Eket, especially when using the taller, doored cabinets, maxs out, rather than minimizes, how the large the small room feels.   For some of the Eket pieces I purchased for the small room, I choose to buy the shallower cabinets as it is easier to squeak them into tight spaces.  In a larger, long, narrow room, with a lower ceiling on one side, the combination of the smaller, randomly stacked Eket “boxes” at the tag end of a run of simple, shorter Besta “frames” (with and without feet), on a low wall, on the floor, is bringing out the best of that space. I’m thinking that’s due to the parallel repetition of long linear lines in both furniture and exposed wood posts, beams, and floor boards. The white cabinets and the simplicity of their lines again maxes out the sense of space within the narrow room.  So, 5 stars for Eket, I think, in bedroom and living room. Maybe 6 stars when scrambled in with other Ikea cabinet systems."
70342199,"Beautiful, sturdy. Such a great piece. Easy to assemble, looks amazing, super sturdy."
20275885,"Exactly what I was looking for!. I bought this to use on it’s side, in place of a traditional (heavy/bulky) dresser. So far, it’s been perfect."
50339292,Love this shelf. Shelf was very easy to put together. Love the black metal locker feel of the cabinet section and the wood shelves. I loved it so much I went back for another.
49306872,"Hard to assemble. I like them, but I forgot to put the back on before I put the last side on it. Can’t get it apart now so the back is open. Kind of silly to have an open back when I purchased doors to keep my nosy dog out of them. He can just go around to the back now."
20275814,4 Stars!. The stainless steel screw heads are very conspicuous. I had to paint them white to make them blend in. The rest was great as always!
80334603,"Perfect storage unit. The EKET is a great storage unit. You can line them up, stack them up, hang them up or go solo. The colors are bright, and the assembly was easy."
10275862,Love it. Easy to assemble and looks really good.
80401292,"Awesome!!. I brought four of these. Three to use to hold bottles and one to use to hold my shoes. They go really well and fit perfectly inside the cubes. They are really easy to assemble. I will be getting me some more because they are able to hold nine pairs of shoes. I do wish they were a little cheaper; however, they are worth every penny."
10409932,Nice and sturdy unit.. Nice and sturdy unit.
60333954,Garbage. This unit goes together like a complete piece of garbage. This is overthought. The last piece does not fit right. Had two units. Both exactly the same.

39285808,"okay. easy to build but I never got the rail to mount it on the wall, despite it saying that it comes include, it didn't. like what was the point of me paying like $5 extra for this wall mounting unit if it didn't come with the rail to mount it."
00314642,Perfect Pairing. Is perfect with the shelving unit for my yarn crafting accessories!
20275814,Kallax LOVE. I now have 4 different Kallax cube configurations in my craft space. Love the finish look of these pieces and the open storage for unlimited use.

89386107,"Great casual bookcase setup. Color is bright, materials are decent, holds alot of books and other various items"
60275812,Kallax. The product is easy to assemble but I have to warn you that if you buy the accessories the accessories are a little harder to assemble than the product itself when I say the accessory like the doors and drawers they take a little bit more time to assemble

10275862,"Bookshelf. Easy directions, quick assembly, I put it together in about an hour"
70391038,"Just Perfect!. I bought one of these to put in our kitchen to add more storage for our items. I already loved the style, but I was worried about the color. It was a perfect rich color, so I bought another one. It was the easiest piece to put together. It took maybe 20 to 30 minutes."
70342199,"Excellent Product. I chose it for the size for use in a very limited space, then realized how perfect it fit in with the color scheme in the apt. It is sturdier than it appears and was easy to put together."
50334591,Nice Cubbies. These are pretty awesome for displaying things. Get some acrylic risers in there and you have the perfect display case.
10275862,"Love It!!. I love this unit, I use it this in my storage room/Guest room. It makes storing all my decorations and craft supply look nice and organized."

79442694,Awesome. I love the stand! It makes it so much airier in the room without it sitting completely on the ground
10305741,Easy to put together and beautiful when done. It was great to put it together and put it up in one day and make it look beautiful and I’ve been able to distribute my craft supplies in an organized fashion.
90286649,Better than expected. Needed to changed my bookcase into a credenza and this was the perfect fix. Really elevated my piece

99306860,Just what I wanted. The perfect cabinet for work electronics and supplies close at hand.
60275812,"Functional and Totally Usable. Great item. Quality parts and has many uses. I use mine as an airbrush station. Airbrush booth on top, compressor in a bottom cube and paint/accessory storage in the other cubes. Couldn't be happier."

89398718,"Its the good, very nice,. Its the good, very nice, and the fågelbajs!"
70388639,Waited for white. It took four months to have the white available when I could drive 1 1/2 hours to pick it up. I’m glad I waited. Only four stars as the unit really could have used another coat of paint - just a white wash finish—-
49285817,LOVE these!. I used 5 of these and 2 double cubes and did a random shelf feature in my living room. Everyone loves them and I'm very happy with the end look. The hanging hardware (sold separate) worked wonderfully!
10305741,Great design. I bought this shelves and accessories a month ago and created our own unique style which matches our family room design
69329387,Clean and solid. Assembled and installed my Eket double drawer cabinet. Installation was smooth as I made sure I truly followed each step carefully. This along with the mounting bracket gave my room a great clean and open look!

60275812,Record storage. Works great for what we bought it for
00275848,"The perfect piece!. Not difficult to put together, especially if two people work together. Sturdy and solid. Versatile with so many IKEA options for inserts. The frustration is chasing those inserts. Most are unavailable or not available for delivery. The use of the piece diminishes when the inserts are not available."
20275814,Well made. Have been using these at work and home for organizing and storage
10275862,"Absolutely LOVE IT!!!. It was exactly what I was looking for. A nice storage unit to organize my bedroom and put my plants on. I've purchased baskets for some of the cubbies and craft boxes (12 x 12) fit perfectly! Plus, I've rolled up my scarves and put them all into one cubbie. It's perfect for my needs!"
80275887,No complaints. Versatile and sturdy. The newer pieces are much lighter than those from 20 years ago but still the same great product.

20409936,Wonderful quality and consistency. Love that I can rely on the coloring to match other product bought years earlier. This product lasts and is durable even after several moves.
80275887,Love my Kallax!. Love my Kallax!
80275887,The kallax. Its fantastic
20275885,"This was not our first. This was not our first Ikea furniture to assemble, but this was incredibly easy to put together. These shelves are classic and Ikea really makes the best quality version of these vs other sellers. My only complaint is that a lot of the accessory/insert things that you can buy are usually in white. Would love to be able to buy black to match my shelves."
10487816,Love this!. These shelves are just what I was looking for for my classroom theme! They are metal and wood together so I know it'll be sturdy and durable since I like to take care of my belongings.
70301537,Love it. Great sturdy shelf. I love that it comes with all types of inserts so you can get exactly what you want.
50305739,Great item!. Great item!

80275887,Good quality. Good quality
30275861,Excellent. Excellent
20275814,Great Storage Solution. The Kallax is generally better for bigger items rather than small knick knacks. It's a lot of space so I use it for clothes and bulkier items like books.
10305741,"Functional flat-pack furniture!. We have multiple iterations of the Kallax in our home. We use them for toys, craft supplies and even as our TV stand. It's the perfect size for a 65"" TV. We have used the drawer inserts and love them also."
90286649,"Easy assembly, nice finishes. This is tight and stunning look after assembled."
49294548,Great quality and looks. This book case is well made and easy to assemble. It also looks fantastic and elevates the space it's in. Highly recommended.
10409932,The product is good looking. The product is good looking and sturdy. Once assembled it may wiggle a bit and would have been better if a partial or full board at the back holds all the sides together.
30275861,Our 2nd Kallax Unit. One of the sturdiest pieces of furniture I own. I just love these units but sure wish there was a better selection of 13”x15” fabric cubes at Ikea as those available are drab or look outdated.
10409932,Perfect. This is perfect for what we had planned
00388633,They are solid wood!! No. They are solid wood!! No practical board or thin veneers. They look great in my living room on either side of a large window.
10345073,"Great idea!. Great design, handy, good looks"
70342199,Great Buy. I absolutely love these shelves! They were super easy to put together and they look perfect next to the matching TV stand!
60278170,Love it. Love it
10305741,Kallax Bookcase. The Kallax bookcase looks great and sturdy. Pretty easy to assemble. I ordered two units.
40303439,"Love this shelf!. I bought this shelf to use as a plant stand near my windows. It works perfect, has enough height in each shelf (there’s only a few big plants I can’t fit on it so I put them on the top) and I love that the shelves are glass so that light can get through. I was debating just getting the cheaper shelves that ikea offered but I’m happy I splurged for these! Some of the screws did get stripped easily during assembly and were hard to really get in but you just need to take your time with those. That’s really the only flaw with it was trouble during assembly."
60275812,Finally a Vinyl Shelf!. If you’ve looked high and low for a shelf to hold your vinyl records this is it! Price and quality are superb and it is exactly what i needed!
20275814,Very versatile and clean look. I might have a slight obsession with the Kallax system. This was 7th Kallax added to my house. They’re incredibly versatile and with the different sizes there are numerous configuration that you can use. I wish they had a 3x2 set.
19278272,Great price. Nice
70286645,Kallax narrow shelf and drawers. I purchased the Kaplan narrow shelf unit and the drawer inserts as a gift for my niece and her husband. They put it in their daughters bedroom to organize her arts and crafts things. They all like it and sent me a picture of the bedroom all neat and organized. It matches her white desk. They are very happy with the unit and it looks nice in their home! I feel good that my gift met their needs!
40415601,Closet storage. I needed something that would help make my closet more utilized. I bought 2 of these and they fit perfectly within a couple of inches. Now I have tote storage on each side and the closet makes much more sense now.
99017445,G r e a t. Wonderful
40275846,A bit shaky.. A bit shaky.
00275848,Excellent. I love this product!
70339291,Simple but Detailed. Love that it has clean lines but it has details throughout. Which makes the screwing of 397538 screws worth it. I used a drill just because it expedited the process. super easy to do even alone. OOO also very light so easily moved around.
40346924,Great shelf. This is your vanilla ikea shelf with your favorite topping! The color is absolutely excellent. I love the solid grey sides and lighter grey/brown mix for the front.
80275887,Definitely a must have!. If you don’t have at least 1 Kallax shelf in your house do you actually go to IKEA? I have 1 in my nursery and 2 in my office/extra room and I absolutely LOVE them! So versatile.
00415599,Great addition to my living room. I bought 2 of these units and put them side by side for a base for the tv. Very easy to put together. Added a lot of depth to my living room!
00415599,Love it. Love it
40314640,Good. Good
80334603,Cube. Made well like it very much
60333954,"frustration. I bought two. The video makes assembly look easy, and in theory it should be. But the holes are poorly cut and don't line up. I ended up having to use a hammer to get these to align. I never could get the backboard on the second unit because they wouldn't line up. They look ok and will serve their purpose, so I won't return them. But I definitely won't buy another and can't recommend."
20275885,Love these easy to set. Love these easy to set up
10409932,Cube shelves. This product was easy to assemble and looks great in my newly remodeled office.
10305741,"Perfect storage and style. Sturdy, handsome piece for so many storage needs."
20275885,"Very good, great price. Bought 3 for my studio, nice!"
40415601,Exactly what I was looking. Exactly what I was looking for record album storage!
80428852,"The most difficult box I’ve ever assembled. The little pre drilled white things don’t fit into the pre drilled holes, it’s insanely difficult to make them fit. You have to bang every side up against the ground and with a hammer or you can’t assemble it. Looked like crap at the end and spent hours being frustrated. All four units I bought were like this, they’re all faulty. Do not buy."
20275814,Easy to assemble and just. Easy to assemble and just what a needed for the space in my bedroom.

60275812,Nice bookshelf. It was just what in needed for my home office.
10275862,"Disappointed. I've been shopping at IKEA for 20 years, and the quality of this piece was very disappointing. In order to assemble it, I had to hammer pieces together, which resulted in the outside splintering. Luckily it's only for the basement."
20275885,Love these shelves!. The shelves are so versatile and sturdy. Very happy with them.
10345073,"Works great. Looks great. Does the job.. We put our fancy napkins and rings in it, right above the plates. Looks nice, functional, practical."
00415599,"kallax. This product was the perfect size, fits right below the window and with the bins everything has a place. I live in a 350ft house so space need to be used to the mack. I put the unit together by myself (69) and had no problem. It came in 2 boxes so I was able to carry myself. 90 percent of the furniture in my house is Ikea from bed, closets, kitchen and bath. Very happy with Ikea products."
10275862,Kallax. Versatile & sturdy storage & display.
00275848,"Simple and sturdy.. Perfectly sized for books, vinyl albums, games, toys and more. Simple and sturdy."

60278170,"Awesome. Easy to install, looks nice and neat"
20275885,Works perfect for what we needed. I bought one of these units for my daughter's toy room and then purchased another for the foyer to store shoes. I love them in both places.
20409936,"great for the value, easy. great for the value, easy to assemble"
29278304,Perfect bar cabinet. We used this configuration and added some legs and x inserts for wine. Bottle storage and glasses contained. Looks great.
80334603,Was a little difficult to. Was a little difficult to put together
00275848,"Love Kallax!. I now own five of them, and need one more! They are fantastic. Use with inserts or just as an open bookcase. So easy to put together and look fantastic."
70391038,"Great for home office. Like many we are now working from home which means using our personal printer more and this is our new printer stand, paper storage, and bookshelf. One unit instead of several gives us more space to work."
70339291,Nice open shelving in living room sturdy v. Very nice and has room for displaying family photos

50214678,"sleek. light modern look, Great for opening up small spaces."
20275814,"Awesome product. However, my studs are not spaced per the bracket setup, and there are no instructions on how to move the bracket within the cabinet to line up with the studs"
79278325,Great storage shelf!. Was easy to put together (did it mostly by myself - just needed help with lifting it at the end). Looks great in the room and holds a lot!
80275887,"Classic/practical storage option. We have the 1x4 cube unit and the 2x4 book shelf. We love these! They're simple, practical and attractive."
20275814,"I purchased this to store. I purchased this to store my teaching materials in my home office. It’s perfect for what I needed it for. My husband was able to put it together without difficulty or complaint. I have since purchased another for my home office and two more to hold books. I’m using these to replace an old shelving unit. They’re sturdy, nice looking, & easy to move around! These are great!"
20275814,"Just what I needed. I got this unit and another to create a storage space in my sewing room. They were easy to assemble, sturdy yet lightweight, and fit nicely into the intended space. My only request would be some way to clamp two units together for extra sturdiness- but since they attach to the wall that's not a big issue."
60275812,"Easy to Assemble, and I. Easy to Assemble, and I didn't need some complex toll too, as it was supplied with the required screw tool, thank goodness."
00275848,It was so easy to. It was so easy to put together my new shelving.
19931865,Looks great!. Looks great!
20409936,Cubbie. Christmas present for son
70286645,Love these. This drawer unit went together so easily and fits the Kallax unit perfectly. Very smooth operating drawer runners
90305803,"Looks very nice. I’m really happy with this bookcase, exactly what I needed. It was easy to put together."
00314642,"Compact but Roomy!. I was afraid the four drawer units I purchased were going to be more for show than storage, but was I wrong! Not only do they hold quite a bit, they’re so smooth. They glide in and out like custom cabinetry!"
40415601,Great. Easy to assemble. Looks great. Sturdy
80275887,"Great quality, great price. When looking for shelving for our kids' playroom, I shopped around quite a bit. The Kallax was actually better quality and lower price than everything else I was finding for this particular kind of shelving. We didn't want all of the shelves to be open and got 13""x13"" bins elsewhere which fit perfectly snug inside the openings."
80275887,"Great shelf!. Great! Sturdy, looks good. I also bought the legs that go with this shelf so that I can stand it on its side and use it as a toy, books, accessories shelf for my baby's room. Looks great! It's a great quality especially for the price. Other similar shelves from other stores that are closer in price if not a bit higher tend to be more flimsy and don't come with the legs."
80508504,"Look ok / Quality lacking. I bought 4 of these to install in a bright green Kallax. The first three installed fairly easy. The fourth one gave me a lot of difficulty; one of the hinge side screws somehow broke a large hole in the side of the Kallax resulting in it being useless.  Overall I am happy with the look of this product. However, I wish that it was offered in right/left options. My unit is in a very tight corner and I’d prefer the doors to open out from the center rather than up against the wall. I also wish that the interior of the insert was black to match the door rather than bright white. If you’re using it in a white Kallax it would work. But in any other color Kallax, the white really stands out. If it were black like the door itself it would just look like part of the door."
60278170,"Great design, handy, good looks. Great design, handy, good looks"
20409936,Great shelf. It was pretty easy to put together and it looks great!

90286649,"Good. It's a fine product and does what it advertises. Even having looked at it, I didn't realize the drawers would be quite so shallow, but it's fine."
80275887,Love my Bookcase. Works great
70301537,Works for craft room. Works well for craftroom
60275812,Love it!. It's perfect to have for kids school. Or toys
20275814,Lovely. I love all my products i received and shipping was on time. I will order again it beat trying to carry it in your car to get it home.
20275885,"VERSATILE, ATTRACTIVE, STURDY. We are using these wall units in different configurations, and for different purposes. In our bonus room on the side to hold a large screen TV with cubbys for storage, then flanked vertically. In our home office as a wall unit, as well as on top of a desk return on it’s side. Just love them!"
99306860,"Exactly as expected. I bought two of these to place side-by-side in my office. I noticed several reviews complaining about the difficulty of putting these together, but I found them easy to assemble. After connecting each panel by hand, you will need a rubber mallet to gently tap the panels together. Do NOT use a hammer. Use a rubber mallet and GENTLY tap the panels in place. Make sure you are doing this on a rug so you don't damage the panels or the floor."
30275861,Good product. Good product
00314642,Great value. I strongly recommend this product. It's great value
89285820,"We mounted this to the. We mounted this to the wall for a floating bookshelf, and it works great. Assembly is a little difficult because all the fasteners are plastic and you have to press everything together by hand--a hammer would break it."
60275812,"Looks great!. This looks terrific once it’s built! Super easy to put together. Holds a lot of albums. My only complaint is that all of the panels are actually hollow. This makes it feel extremely cheap. IKEA could improve this by using real wood, even plywood."
20275814,Shelf unit is great!. Good price! Good quality!
59278307,"Great set up for Laundry/catch all room. I have bought cube storage from other stores before and there is no comparison to these. Very easy to put together, sturdy and work well for organizing a room or area that tends to be a catch all."
79278250,"Love the cubies. Love the cubies but not thrilled with the doors.  Built the cubies with my mom easily but the door sections should have pre-drilled holes to make placement easier.  I installed one door but it didn’t line up well, so I took it off.  Just using as more cube storage"
90286649,Purchased for bedside tables.. Purchased for bedside tables.
00314642,"Nice-looking- but could be built to hold more--. These were easy to assemble, and fit nicely into the KALLAX cube storage system. The drawers only reach halfway up the opening on the sides though. I am using them for sewing room storage, and they don't hold nearly as many small items as they could if the sides were taller."
00415599,"missing part on assessors. Kallax unit was ok, but ee are still waiting on a missing part for our kallax door insert. It was ordered directly with Customer Service at our local store."
70301542,Kallax. I have several KALLAX items throughout my house. They are awesome pieces that serve many purposes. Love how they look and function.
29336356,"Small but great!. Excellent design, well made, quick and simple to assemble. Most of all, my wife was very pleased with the result when the cubes hung on her wall."
89278297,"High gloss delicate, be careful. While it looks better and comes with a premium, the high gloss surfaces are delicate. I have about 5 regular Kallax items in dark brown/black and none were this delicate. I used a rubber mallet to help drive the boards into the pegs and you can see the indentations on the glossy surface where the mallet was used. Fortunately I used it laying on the floor horizontally and the marks are hidden. Be careful, looks great otherwise."
00275848,Love that I can built. Love that I can built my craft room slowly by adding pieces as needed.!

10275862,"Its a good buy, just. Its a good buy, just moves a bit if you don't drill it to the wall."
50481172,"Great and simple look. I used this in a little nook by my kitchen window to place plants. It looks great! Dimensions fit perfect, although I wish the height between the shelves were adjustable so my plants have more room to grow. Otherwise, a great deal for the price!"
70339291,Excellent. I enjoy the industrial/rustic style. I bought mine in as-is so I didnt have to assemble the shelf and I also got a discount. The only conundrum I've had so far is wire shelf at the bottom is a bit tricky to dust
50339292,"A lot of style for your money. I have two of these put together for an extra long, low shelving unit. I love them and they are so stylish. Fairly simple to put together, follow the instructions - including rereading. I found them to be excellent value for the $."

20409936,Great versatile product. Great for space saving and organizing.
40501892,Wonderful! Gives a whole new. Wonderful! Gives a whole new look. Wish you had this frame to fit the KALLAX 4 cube!!!!!!
10409932,"Love decluttering!. We wanted to get rid of the clutter of numerous toy storage options we had accumulated. This unit works exactly as we hoped. We found clear bins at another store and the children now love putting toys away. That feature might not last, but one can hope! Very solid and stable."
00334536,"Love love love eket!. When we redid our daughters’ room we needed to replace their Kallax bookshelf with something only slightly narrower. I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the eket is smaller, it holds way more books! This would be because the inner and outer walls are thinner. The eket takes some more muscle to put together than kallax but you can get more functionality from the eket. Plus we liked that they have backs so our kids don’t lose things in the abyss behind the unit. Also included are the stand-off posts so it can be flush against your floor trim and the wall! My new favorite go-to piece!"

The additional storage boxes you can buy to go with are an amazing option because they give you a quick and easy ""drawer"" option that doesn't break the bank."
20275814,What’s not to love?. I’m a fan of the Kallax series and this is no different. The small size was easy to assemble solo in about ten minutes. The top is big enough to hold a printer turned sideways which is awesome. I just wish they had more color options in the fabric bins like in the past.

60275812,"Awesome storage idea. This item has been on of my favorite purchases from Ikea. I love how much the bins hold and have used these for years as an alternative to buying bedroom furniture (dresser’s, chests, nightstand’s). I have minimal closet space and using these bins has given me maximum storage capacity for clothes, shoes, etc. I have at least 20 of these units throughout my home and they are just perfect."

20409936,Great product. Great product

90286649,Works great. Works great and I love it extra space for little piece s
20275814,"Looks good, easy install. I use this in my 2 year old son's room. It stores a lot of stuff. It was very easy for me to install alone. 20 minutes tops. Love how it looks and it feels sturdy."
89386107,Love it. It's worth the money
00275848,Perfect fit. I needed something for storage that would fit under my large window. I was rearranging my craft room and didn't have enough storage. Kallax + bins and done! I'll put a cushion on top and the cat will be able to look out at squirrels all day!
70483274,A great ablum display. This is the right size for my ablum display and putting thing in it I love it too bad there no glass door to it or else I can buy two instead of one

70339291,Love this shelf unit!. Love this shelf unit!
40275846,Inexpensive coffee table. I bought this item to use as a coffee table as I didn't like any features of actual coffee tables that I had seen. I wish this item came in a half size to fit two bins.

39278290,Great TV stand and mini dresser. Absolutely love this thing. We bought an extra set of drawers and used the final open area for our Alexa device. We have this wall-mounted with our TV on top. Saves so much space on the floor. We are in love with this. So versatile and modular.

10305741,Perfect cubby storage. Perfect cubby storage
20275814,Lots of storage. Great for craft storage. Love the inserts made especially for the kallax.
10305741,"Glossy finish off-putting. I love the shape, design. But the mounting is not functional. The security brackets are not spaced for both to hit studs, so the expectation is that one would be in a stud and one in an anchor. I decided to wall-mount mine, so I placed brackets on the bottom. It looks great on the wall. And finally, the finish is glossy, almost glassy, which clashes a little with my eggshell walls. Not a deal-breaker, but not what I was hoping for."
70286645,Clean organization. I love the drawers to go with the Kallax. They look very nice and work well. My only complaint (and why they lost a star) is the drawers could go deeper. Currently there is a decent gap at the back and you end up losing in the bottom of the box.
80275887,"Great. I’ve built about 5 of these in different sizes over the years. Always turn out great. Sturdy, nice size selection and easy to build."
89278259,Loved it. Loved it

70332124,Cute Cube storage. Have these in my walk in closet displaying some of my shoes on the wall
70339291,Recommended for bedroom storage. Fairly easy to put together by oneself (just pay attention to orientation of the parts during assembly). I use these with the seagrass baskets and some wicker baskets I buy from another chain on alternating shelves. They look pretty darn good and hold a lot of stuff. I've also purchased the matching TV stand.
70286645,"fine, but too small. Looks good, works well, easy to assemble. But the drawers are way too small. Instead of the drawer slides that take up a lot of space, I'd rather have drawers on plain wood rails so that you can have two drawers that fill the entire space the cube."
10305741,"The quintessential record cabinet. Perfect for vinyl, which is what I use it for. Is nice quality and easy to assemble.   My product did have a small amount of damage that was from when they packaged at the factory. (Product is flat-packed and there was damage to a plank as I opened the box.) Make sure to carefully inspect upon opening. Still, overall, looks great holding my media."
20275814,Excellent. Excellent
70342199,Functional with style.. I placed this next to an apartment entry door to hold items needed for going out or being brought in. Lends itself well to holding a decor lamp on any of the shelves to add a little light in a dim space. Quite sturdy.
20275885,"Sturdy and great price. I bought this for my daughter's room. She loves it. There is plenty of room for books, and we bought 2 cabinet and drawer inserts for other items. It's sturdy and seems well made. I was surprised at how inexpensive this was even with all the inserts."
50339292,Holds a lot and looks. Holds a lot and looks great in my office/craft room
10409932,"Kallax is Great product. This is my 8th?. Kalisz is a fantastic product. Good price, sturdy, easy to handle & assemble, very good quality, great size storage cubes. Improvements: offer more colors,lots more designs for types of more cube accessories, and keep Drona in stock, would love more designs like the black butterfly cubes (sorry I missed those they are not available anywhere!) bring back the casters which came as a pair mounted on on metal bar. They are so sturdy & make moving units a breeze"

70342199,Almost perfect. While I really like the design but I was a little disappointed that the shelves weren’t made of a heavier metal or they could have used wood like the top shelf.
20275814,"Perfect what I need. I bought this to hold my record player and records. It would have been better if there was some backing. However, I can go buy some from Lowe’s and apply."
30275861,". great, easy to install, a little heavy, works good"
80275887,Modular functional style. The Kallax series is very versatile in creating functional stylish storage solutions
30275861,"Perfect for my needs. Great for my needs... Perfect for wall in my office. I removed a star for difficult in putting shelves all the way into the wooden dowels. Even with help and after completing the assembly, some shelves have a tiny gap between them and the neighboring panel. Maybe I should flip it to go on other side so that those shelves with a gap are the side walls and not the shelves themselves?"
70301537,Perfect for what we needed!. Our small business carries T-shirts for our employees and we were in need of something to put the T-shirts in. The KALLAX was and is perfect for what we needed. We also bought the DRONA box that fits in the KALLAX to put the T-shirts in. Best of all the KALLAX was sturdy enough to hold all of the T-shirts. We are thrilled with the outcome.

60278170,Kallax. Love it!
20275814,fits perfectly in the closet. fits perfectly in the closet for extra storage
80334603,Impossible to put together. DO NOT BUY. Wish I actually read the reviews before driving 2.5 hours to an Ikea and purchasing 4. These are impossible to put together. I literally needed to hammer the first one together because there is no way I could get the two pieces to slid together. On the second one I broke the connectors because even hammering wouldnt make them slide into place. Not sure what I am going to so considering I live so far away from the nearest Ikea so returning is a HUGE inconvenience. I may just use wood screws like they should have used in the first place. Don't get these.
80275887,So universal. The Kallax are so universal. I personally like them because they are deeper than a bookshelf as I have quite a few books that are oversized hardcovers.
00275848,Perfect. Craft storage. A must have

20275814,"Fan of these series!. I simply love kallax! Is one of the easiest furniture IKEA has, one of the most organizable as well. Helps me keep hidden all of my kids’ toys inside the DORNAS boxes, which they can have an easy access to."
60275812,"I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. I wanted to get the Billy Bookcases. Online it said they were in stock. Even at the store it said they were in stock, but they weren't. Since I do not live close to the store, I did not want to waste my trip and so I settled for buying the Kallax bookcases instead. I bought 4 of them, all different sizes. I was very disappointed.   Regardless of size they are held together with 8 screws and wooden dowls. The wooden dowls do not fit well into the holes. Since they are a few inches long but thin, a few of them broke. Luckily I have tools and my own dowl jig so I drilled them out, widened the holes and used bigger dowls.  I also had to use a rubber mallet to tap the dowls fully into the holes. I then had to also use the mallet to tap everything together because I could not push everything together snuggly and I'm pretty big.   I eventually got everything together but it was a lot more work than it needed to be. They can either use thicker dowls and/or drill their holes ever so slightly bigger so everything will fit together easily.   I never had these problems when assembling their Billy bookcases of which I have 12 or 13 of."

80275887,Beautiful. This bookcase is beautiful and very sturdy
60275812,"Great Product but you need a friend. This is a great product! I absolutely love it! It fits so well in my dorm room and helps me stay organized. The little totes that you can buy to hide your items come in all sorts of colors and styles, so this shelf is really easy to personalize! The only concern is that you might need a friend to help with assembly. While it is possible to do it alone, it would have been much easier (and more level in the end) with some assistance."
70301542,Kallax. Love it!
10305741,high gloss stunner!. i have come to the conclusion that everything should be made in high gloss. it's just so great! it makes this standard bookshelf so much more luxurious to look at - reflecting the light and making the piece seem richer and more expensive than it was. i love the ones i have and would get them again and again.
89386107,Great bookcase. Great bookcase

20275814,. I now have three. Perfect for what I was looking for.
30275861,"I love this classic.. I used this as a room divider in my small apartment. It's not so tall that it blocks the view or light from the windows, and you can see through it so it has a clean and airy appearance. I put Bullig boxes on the bottom row and may put a couple more on the next row up. It holds an amazing amount of storage without making the space look cramped or cluttered."
19278272,Great product. Love the doors to hide away and organize our lives
70301542,. Bought 1 year ago loved it got another past month

70301537,Kallax shelves are nice.. Meets my needs and expectations. Great purchase
70301537,"Perfect solution for my quilting storage. This 5 x 5 Kallax is just what I needed to store and organize my quilting materials — fabric, second sewing machine, quilts in progress, supplies, etc. A few of the storage boxes made for Kallax hide scraps of fabric and small loose items. This was a great solution to my needs"
80303437,". Clean lines, simple, and versatile. It fits in nicely with our décor. Love that it has glass shelves. We've had several friends tell us its a great addition to our living room."

70301537,Nice product higher quality than. Nice product higher quality than target or Walmart stuff easy to assemble very easy to purchase and pick up will definitely purchase similar products
60275812,Very well made. This sturdy shelf unit is really nice. I have another by a different company and it’s flimsy compared to this. I’m thinking of replacing it. Great product and easy to put together.
80275887,Grest size. Love the size. Great way to hide toys in bins in shelf. Thicker material.
80275887,Love this shelf. I love the versatility of this book shelf
70301537,"I spent years eyeing the. I spent years eyeing the Kallax and now finally have it. I am more than pleased to finally have it. Assembly was easy and can be done alone until it needs to be stood up. I would buy this product again and plan on adding more Kallax pieces of different sizes in the future.   I docked one star because the product arrived with damage that obviously occurred before or during packaging. The damage is on visible pieces and IKEA expects you to personally return the item to the store or accept a discount and settle for a damaged shelf (because return services are not currently available). Based on other reviews, damaged parts seems to be common. In spite of this, I would buy this product again."
80275887,"Easy!. Went together quickly and easily, looks great…,"
40275846,"Easy to assemble. The item is really simple, the quality is ok . Maybe a little overpriced"
40275846,Very easy to assemble. Very easy to assemble

90286649,Worked just as it should.. Worked just as it should.
60278170,"Some better, some worse.. The old style doors were much more robust, but also took up more space in the unit. These units are held in place with a heavy weight cardstock like material."
80275887,Very nice product. Very nice product
50339292,"Perfect for my needs. Fairly straightforward to assemble, and I really like the overall look. I use it as a small wardrobe for my bedroom with fabric boxes. Looks great."
00275848,"A best buy. Have been shopping at IKEA for many years. Have come to know the level of quality and how to choose the pieces. With care and love, they last and last. This is one that I have several others in different sizes. Installed clear wheels and 2 white doors for a low, under tv cabinet. Gorgeous"

10275862,Looks nice. Looks nice
49306872,Attractive storage option. The cubbies are a perfect choice for adding extra storage in a small space.
70301537,Huge but great. Huge but great
60275812,"Still good, but much smaller. The only reason why this is not a 5 star is because it is noticeably smaller than the previous Kallax cube units that I have purchased. The pieces are thinner than how they were originally made."
20275885,Great. Great
60278170,excellente. we love it
60275812,I have 3 now. Great. I have 3 now. Great in my children’s rooms for storing toys.

20409936,"EASY TO PUT TOGETHER AND GREAT LOOKING. LOVE THIS SHELF UNIT. THE BEST EVER. STYLISH, CAN BE USED SEAMLESSLY AS A ROOM DIVIDER. A LOVELY PIECE OF FURNITURE. STRONG."
20278167,Easy to install. I love this product. Keeps the dust away. Provide perfect barrier to dust.
20275885,"Added to my existing units. I love the Kallax series! My partner was unsure about the boxy look, but when I showed him how adding books and Knick knacks changed the appearance he was convinced, so we bought enough to fill an entire wall, top to bottom."
60275812,Kallax Great. No problem getting it set up. Easily takes load of all items stored in and on top of it.
40275846,"Nice and versatile. This is my second Kallax unit. I have one in the bathroom as an organizer for towels etc. the other one is in my closet and it’s my organized for my router, switch and other internet related stuff. They are easy to put together, which is a huge plus, and they look good. And they are really versatile, being able to add single or double doors, etc."
30275861,Terrific buy!. Love this shelf unit! It is so versatile. I'm using it as a room divider and craft/sewing unit. Looking forward to purchasing another.
20275885,"Nice bookshelf. It fits its intended space perfectly. Unfortunately, IKEA did not have the baskets i wanted in stock."
70301542,Good for board games. It is best size for tens of board games.
70286645,"Good but…. There’s a lot of space wasted at the back of the drawers, as they don’t reach all the way to the back of the cube when closed. It’s weird considering how well IKEA uses every available inch. I wish the drawer sides were higher too, they are quite short. Can’t put anything too heavy in there either as the bottoms of the drawers are quite flimsy. But all in all they look great, and do the trick."
50339292,"Fjallbo = Form and Function and Style. It's a good piece, very versatile, sturdy and compliments a young adult's bedroom. It was easy to assemble and we like the wood/metal combination."
40275846,Love it. Love it
60275812,alignment during installation was hard. Alignment during the installation was quite challenging. We had to try very hard to put on the screws after we somehow managed to get it aligned
80275887,Great storage option. got two of these for my craft room - will probably buy at least one more to fill the wall - great for getting organized.
40303439,Love it. Assembly needed two people to the get the top and bottom shelf into place. Otherwise very easy. Looks great in my living room. Had planned to spray it gold first but left it white and got gold/metallic items for decoration instead.
70388639,"Great for a bookshelf. Relatively easy to put together, sturdy and great as a bookshelf. Love that it’s solid wood."
60278170,Great addition to Kallax. Great for hiding the 'stuff' that store on these shelves.
40303439,"Great shelf but hard to attach to wall. I love this shelf. But, we have baseboards so it doesn't lie flat against the wall and you can't use the included screws for attaching it to the wall. I asked many different IKEA salespeople what they recommend and after the 7th person someone finally gave me a dresser strap which I have to jimmy rig to make it work safely."
00275848,Craft storage. Love these shelves. added another one on top of the four cube shelve. gives me lots more storage for my crafts
80275887,Easy to assemble. Perfect storage. Easy to assemble. Perfect storage for my art/craft studio.
30275861,Excellent shelving. I live it it's very sturdy and big
00334536,"Difficult assembly.. I've put IKEA furniture together for years. This piece, as others have commented, is a pain to put together. I followed instructions exactly. The last board cannot slide into place because the back piece needing to be in the slot cannot fit until after it's together, which makes no sense. Waste of money as the piece is damaged trying to get it put together. Buy the allen wrench, screwed pieces."
60333954,"Perfect size for storing vinyls. I bought this specifically for the purpose of storing our records since our collection had outgrown the little shelf we were using. The shelfs are perfectly sized for this. I'd had my eye on another, similar shelf from a different home goods store, but it was much more expensive so I was excited to get a better deal.  That being said, I've bought plenty of IKEA pieces in the past and know that sturdiness is not a strong suit and instructions are somewhat lacking in specificity. With that in mind, I tried to be as gentle as possible when putting the shelf together. However, after some confusion with the instructions where I had to separate pieces I'd put together, I ended up with a couple of small cracks and bumps. Luckily it was tucked in the back and I was able to remedy with duct tape and white paint so you can't really tell. Overall, I'm happy with it but know I'll probably end up replacing it with a sturdier piece sometime down the road."
70301537,Storage atlast!. Wanted somethin that would hold my craft stuff and my quilting stuff and look good like it belongs in the room. The fact I can add drawers and cupboards and all the fun inserts helps gettin organized that much easier! So happy!
10409932,Flat packages are easy to. Flat packages are easy to transport home. Installing it was a piece of cake. I love my Kallax very much.
20275885,Great Record Album Storage Unit. Excellent product. Solid construction. Simple assembly. Definitely does the job!
20278167,Beautiful and versatile. I love these cubes you can turn them into anything you want
70301537,10/10. Such an easy and functional way to store clothes and items me and my husband love it and think every time we will always purchase this item!!
90286649,It works well -. It works well -
70339291,Great shelf for the price. Great shelf for the price
20423720,"Love these! They doubled the. Love these! They doubled the storage in my Kallax unit. I was able to find clear storage bins that fit side by side and now can put 4 clear bins in each cube. So happy with my purchase, it is perfect."
60221683,"Perfect!. I bought this because I needed a shelf after removing 80’s style built ins. I love the amounts NF of shelf space it has, that the shelves are adjustable and how light and airy the shelves look. They are also very sturdy. LOVE IKEA!!!!!!! I’ve seen similar shelves elsewhere for over $500"
00275848,great as a mudroom bench. used it as a mudroom bench! easy to install and very sturdy
40314640,Good product. Good quality and easy assembling
20275885,Shelf can be used in many different ways!. I personally have this shelf in multiple different colors in a few different locations in my home. I have a shelf displaying my books and pictures in my living room and a shelf in my laundry room for storage.
20275885,"Maximizes storage and looks good too!. While trying to bring my textile and fiber business home this helped me maximize the small bedroom I was moving into, and cubby basket options are perfect. Bonus! I was able to leave a bed in the room!"
10409932,Kallax is wonderful. We put together a Kallax unit for my sewing room storage. It went together very easily and is perfect for what we wanted to accomplish.
70286645,"Easier than anticipated. 1, 2,3, easily assembled."
40346924,Good product. Good product for the value and purpose. The screws cover does not last at all.
40346924,"Whatever. Cubes to small to be practical, the drawer unit is good for storing batteries, paperclips, old rubberbands and stiff stick of 3 yr. Old gum."
10305802,. It is beautiful and very easy to emsable i loved!!!
60275812,"Solid value!. Purchased this item s couple months ago and I'm very pleased with the construction. It looks like a much more expensive piece, solid. Easy assembly and very functional."
80275887,"Works as TV Bench!!. I bought this for my college apartment because I needed a TV console/stand, but couldn’t afford the “real” ones. Kallax works great I just put it on the side and it has plenty of storage. I assembled it by myself without any problems and it looks great in my apartment. It is exactly what I was looking for!"
10275862,Perfect fit. Got this for my wife to store her yarn. She loves it.
30275861,perfect bookcase. I love this bookcase because it is super sturdy and fits my space. It comes in so many configurations and is perfect for my phot albums as well as smaller items The top serves as display space as well. Thanks for making a great product.
80275887,"Perfect for my needs. Easy to assemble, looks solid!"
20275885,My husband love it. My husband love it
00275848,"Stylish, Versatile, Affordable. The Kallax (and previously the Expedit) series is possibly the best product that Ikea has ever produced. I can't think of a more versatile piece of furniture.   Need some book cases? 4x5 Kallax. Liquor cabinet? 4x1 Kallax with a few hacks. Custom desk setup? 2x4 Kallax with some modifications.  I say this with first-hand experience, because I personally own a dozen (seriously, literally 12) individual Kallax units of varying sizes and am using them as a linen drawer, art supply case, book case, extra dining-room storage, a modified desk, and a room divider, and more. My apartment is probably 50% Kallax by volume. These things are awesome!  Their modern yet simplistic style, and the sheer efficiency of perfectly square cubby holes, make this the swiss army knife of affordable furniture."
30275861,Great Shelf Unit. I got this to make as a divider for my living room and it’s so useful in many ways. Plus I always get compliments on it.
60275812,Love it!!. We first bought one 8 years ago when we first moved in and have loved how it looks with the living room furniture. I recently wanted to
10305741,"Was located in the section with all the black ones. Was placed in the section with all the black ones... Sticker said it was black.... I got home and was ready to build it, and it was white. If I didn’t need it, I would have drove right back and exchanged... Unfortunately I needed it right away."
70286645,Great addition to Kallax Cubes!. These drawers look nice and are great to add to the Kallax cubes for little things that you want out of site. My Kallax cubes are in my sewing/craft room and the drawers are a perfect addition.
50214678,Perfect Size. I really like the simply elegant look of this shelf. I bought 2 of them & they frame my room wonderfully. I like that I can combine them if I need to do so someday.
00275848,Easy to assembled and looks. Easy to assembled and looks great
90305803,"Solid quality, versatile. I bought this one and the tall one and hacked them because I wanted the iron/solid wood look. So I took one of the wood panes to a lumber shop, found some nice wood and had it cut to size. I sanded that, gave it polish, and replaced the top and the glass pane. Now it looks like something bought at WS, super elegant and it's mostly Ikea and some DIY!"
90286649,Surprised. Nice little drawers. They move smoothly and it was surprisingly easy to assemble.
39278290,Great for albums!. Great for albums!
70339291,"Nice addition. Bought this for added space in the kitchen, and it looks very nice. Perfect fit. Functional and decorative."
30275861,"Great shelf unit!. I love these shelves! I bought 2 to cover a wall in our toy room, and the cubbies are perfect for storing lots of different things - a bin of small toys in one, stuffed animals in another, books in another, etc. I took off one star because the wood pegs provided for assembly are just a bit too long, making it impossible to get a tight fit. I thought it was just a fluke or they weren't going in all the way, but every peg was the same size and no amount of banging or applying pressure (i.e. my husband leaning almost his entire 200 lbs of weight on it) made them fit better. So there is a little gap between the main sides and the inner shelves, but luckily it is not really noticeable when there is stuff on the shelves."
10275862,. Easy to assemble. Doesn’t feel very strong when assembled. Suggest assembling where it will be put. Moving once built not a great idea.
20275814,Third one we’ve purchased. This is the third one we’ve bought and it’s perfectly suited for the purpose. The price is def right and assembly is easy.
20275814,. Great for small spaces and easy assembling. I’m very happy with the purchase.
99017186,Very worthwhile purchase!!!. As usual ikea gets it right. Looks wonderful in my living room while proving space to show off some pieces AND provides storage!!
40314640,"Super easy. Super easy to assemble and adds a great option to the bookcase. Needed some protection from curious kitties, and this door does the trick"
80275887,"Organising MUST-HAVE. I have 5 of these in my home in both black and white. They are so helpful in keeping things organized and they look great! They're so versatile in how they can look with the variety of baskets, bins, drawers and cabinet doors that are available that makes them even more useful. And the price is very affordable."
30275861,"Perfect Storage Organizer. I bought this to reorganize my daughter's room. It's the perfect organizer for her toys, books and movies. I love that you can use big bins that are 13x13x15."
20305745,". We recently bought this shelf and so far we love it. It looks really nice, you can put a lot of stuff in it and you can do whatever you want with it, decorate as you want."
30275861,wonderful addition to my office. I have had this about two weeks .  it takes minimal tools to put it together .  quite literally are used a reflex hammer and a key .  tools are not allowed where I work. I bought a desk top to go with it and a cabinet with drawers it works fabulously I have a large work area it’s very light I can move it
60275812,Very Convenient. The product is easy to assemble and great for storage.
20275885,Looks great and great value.. This piece of furniture was super easy to put together. It took me less than an hour by myself. I purchased one in white and another in black. They are perfect to help organize a room.
50214678,Beautiful shelf! Great value!. This is a great shelf if you need space to display your houseplants! The 3 middle glass shelves are perfect for plants.
40346924,"Great unit!. We bought two of these for a closet/small den area. We put one horizontal like a low dresser, and another vertically, like a bookcase. It's pretty great because they match so well. I like the grey with wood color; it looks sleek and modern but still warm. We put the seaweed baskets in them which fit well (though be careful because sometimes the baskets can be pokey, and make clothes smell like straw), and one the horizontal one, added the kallax grey doors. I wish the doors came with golden knobs because the silver knobs on them don't match the warm tone of the wood as well. Overall, seem sturdy, fantastic price, not too hard to assemble, and really add a ton of store (equivalent to a full sized dresser) to a space. We're excited that if we move again someday we could repurpose them easily as a tv stand, or bookshelf in virtually any room of the house. We might even get another for our bedroom! Thanks IKEA."
20275885,Perfect for need and space. Put it up and works perfectly with doors and containers awesome storage for papers and other odds and ends need keep out of sight
70286645,Looks great. Gonna start of by saying use a power screwdriver! Since this is an add on there are no pre-drilled holes. It takes a good amount of arm strength to use a regular screwdriver. I’ve installed them with both types of screwdrivers on different units. Power tools just to predrill makes it a breeze. I love the way the drawers look and on one unit I added my own knobs. They are more on the shallow side but really work great.
10305741,"Best shelf unit!. I bought this for my sons playroom to organize all the toys. I wish I bought this months ago!!! Best product!!! It’s durable for his spilled and splatters, stores his toys neatly. Would definitely recommend this!!!"
20275885,Great bookshelf. Perfect size for my needs. Easy to assemble.
60333954,"Great Look .. POOR Quality. I purchased the EKET because of the smaller footprint/sleeker design compared to the KALLAX. Unfortunately, the unit we purchased did not align properly and cracked during assembly. We exchanged the unit assuming this was just a lemon but had another issue when assembling our second EKET. This unit did not crack but no matter how hard we could not get the boards to 'click' in place. We really wanted to like this product but the quality/ease of assembly just wasn't there."
10345073,Very clever. This is a nice addition the variety of cube option. Adds a bit of sparkle.
70342199,"Love this shelf. I love this shelf so much that I went and bought another one. It is well made, and looks very modern in both spaces that I have it."
60275812,Perfect Book shelf. Love the size. Easy to assemble.
40346924,Easy to build. I bought 2 of these for my classroom to use as cubbies. I built them both on my own in about an hour. Instructions are easy to follow and comes with everything you need except the hammer. You only need the hammer to tap the wooden pegs into place.
70286645,Perfect for our space. Perfect for our space
10305802,"Great shelf for my office. I like the clean and open airy feeling of the frame. So easy and fun to assemble. Good height between shelves for accent vases and flowers, tall enough for coffee table books to be shelved."
70339291,Sturdy and nice looking. Generally more sturdy than the usual particle-board shelves. Modern-rustic vibe.
20278167,Adds a nice look. Gonna start of by saying use a power screwdriver! Since this is an add on there are no pre-drilled holes. It takes a good amount of arm strength to use a regular screwdriver. I’ve installed them with both types of screwdrivers on different units. Power tools just to predrill makes it a breeze. Also make sure to follow the directions! My doors weren’t closing right and I had to unscrew the plate and raise it a bit on both sides (directions show you might need to do this) and then the doors worked.
50339292,Looks Awesome. Put 2 side by side to make an awesome TV stand.
80275887,"Looks just like the photos, very easy to assemble. Surprisingly one of the easiest assemblies of Ikea products. It went together very smoothly and looks great. Packaged well."
80275887,KALLAX Shelf. Purchased this about a month ago to organize my sons playroom and works perfect with the bins. I did a few slots with the bins and left a few open. Was easy to assemble and looks great!!
10345073,Perfect. The quality of the basket was more than expected
30275861,Easy to assemble. My teenage sons out it together after watching a YouTube video. It was quick and painless and works great!
80275887,". I have 7 of them, that should say something"
20275814,Gets the job done and. Gets the job done and looks great for a fair price!
29278304,Love it!. This is my second Kallax unit. I've got the bigger one in my guest bedroom. I love the versatility of being able to keep some shelves open or add additional doors and drawers. It's just such a versatile piece. I really love it.
60275812,Shelf Unit. Purchased two shelves to organize the clutter in my home. These shelves are not difficult to assemble. All that is needed is a hammer and everything else is included. Blends in with my other furniture. A great buy.
20275885,"Not so easy to put together. I bought this because it looked nice online and the other reviews said it was easy to put together. Not mine! I'm having trouble with the dowels. The wood pieces don't go in easy. If you use a hammer, you will damage the wood."
20275814,Nice and easy!. Easy assembly. Perfect for my sewing room to display my fabric stash!
80275887,"Best for kids organization. This shelf unit is very sturdy, had the perfect size cubby's, and is easy to put together."
10409932,Nice unit for displaying my. Nice unit for displaying my tech gadgets and being able to grab them quickly.
40346924,"Useful to decorate your own way. I bought this 1 month ago and absolutly love it , very easy to assamble and I love to decorate with different color boxes and containers"
40275846,Need more addons. I am looking to fit in wine bottle inserts into this unit. Apparently they are only available in white color. I am looking for ones in black color and also there should be more color options for cube storage inserts.
20275885,Just what I expected the. Just what I expected the best

89278278,"Practical Shelf unit. I bought this shelf unit to put my bird cage on top, and the little fish tank in the shelf. The doors are great to keep the bird's and fish food out of display."
20409936,Great features. Just what I needed! Waited too long to purchase
70301542,"Use a Rubber Mallet!. The directions of the large Kallax are very simple, but be sure you use a rubber mallet to hammer the shelves to the pegs when attaching the sides. I chipped a part of my shelf trying to hammer one of the long shelf parts into the side. No biggie though. I can hide dent. Hammer the sides not the shelves to close the gap on the pegs.  I love my Kallax now that it’s done! Be sure to get a second person to help. It’s very heavy, but sturdy!"

60275812,. Great product for the money
40346924,"Perfect shelf!. Over the last two years we have purchased 5 of these! They fit almost any room either standing tall or longways. We use them as toy storage in one room, use them as dressers in another, and a tv stand in a third room. Very sturdy (if put together correctly) for the low price & look nice too."
10409932,Great. I bought KALLAX SHELF 2 MONTHS AGO. I HAPPY
60333954,"Looks great, not hard to assemble. I almost didn't buy the EKET cabinet since so many people complained about the assembly, but I figured I'm usually pretty good at assembly, and this time proved no different. The first one took about a half hour, including the underframe, the rest about 20 minutes each. A few tips - 1. Look closely at each piece illustrated in the directions to make sure it's facing the right direction before you try to interlock the pegs and holes. Sounds obvious, but it can be deceptive. 2. A rubber mallet (or hammer with a piece of leather or thick blanket over your strike area) makes locking the pegs into the holes much easier. I can see how people expecting a truly tool-less process would find this part difficult. 3. Use common sense with the black pegs that secure the backing, push the pin in only as far as it will go, they don't all have to be equally tight. 4. If attaching the underframe, an electric drill does make it easier. Once it's done, it looks great, sleek and slim but not flimsy."
70301537,Love the look of this piece. We bought this to consolidate some miscellaneous bookshelves and toys in the office. It looks great and was quick and simple to assemble.
70342199,"Nice design, easy install, very stable. Nice design, easy install, very stable"
20275885,Great Look. Love the dark brown color. You can add any color storage inserts. Has two versatile looks.
40275846,good shelf. this was very easy to assemble. however one piece didn't fit. no big deal really.
20275885,"Love this!. I just bought my second one of these when we needed a place to put our TV. We already had one for another TV, and we love it and the storage it allows beneath the TV. And it's so easy to put together."
40415601,Love this product! Great for. Love this product! Great for my crafts and Scrapbook albums
30275861,Love it!!!. I bought this for all my planners and i want to let you know that is so amazing it holds so many thing and it just looks great. love it
20275885,Simple need filled at affordable price. Keep in mind this is not a piece of fine furniture and you shouldn’t expect it to be. I needed something functional for my office and this fit the bill perfectly. I needed a place for my printer and storage for supplies. Perfect
80275887,Great shelf. This shelving unit was easy to assemble and a great price for what you get. Unlike the larger units in this line. This shelf holds together very well and is sturdy.
19278272,great price and nice piece of furniture. I about it about 1 month ago.  Had to come back to get some drawers because they were out of stock for about 1 week
40346924,Exactly what we wanted. We used the Capita legs with this since we didn’t want it sitting directly on the tile floor. It works perfectly.
10275862,"Easy to put together.. This shelving unit is very easy to assemble. Looks nice and was extremely affordable. It's comes with brackets to anker the shelf to a wall. If you don't reinforce the shelf it is a bit wobbly, but for the price you get what you pay for."
80275887,the perfect craft room. Im creating the perfect craft room these are great
10391041,"Bookcase for family room redo. It was absolutely just what I wanted. We got 6 pieces of the havsta for our wall. So much storage and the ability to hide some things behind doors, some behind glass doors and two are open bookshelves. Custom look and fit in a manageable price."
40275846,Easy and functional. Looking for cube shelves and these were exactly what I needed and very affordable. Very easy to put together and sturdy. Would love a little more brown color mixed in. More chocolate.
19285833,"Simple, effective. It’s amazing what $100 and some vision can do to change a room. In my new home, my son’s room size literally shrank by half leaving us little space for his toddler books and trucks (he has a lot). I easily assembled the EKET boxes and my husband mounted them (easily) into the studs using the rail systems, and what a change. IKEA for the save."
70301542,Serves the purpose. Very cheap material. Putting it together chipped some of the wood.
20275885,Love it. Great as a tv stand: added backing and it's perfect
59278307,Great Unit. Bought this for my living room and it's wonderful! Super easy to put together and lots of room for knick knacks and storage! Am buying another one for my craft room!
80303437,"Perfect shelf for a bedroom. I bought this shelf to match the white, furniture asethetic in my bedroom, and I love the features it has. Since there's a solid wooden surface on the bottom and top, I use those to support my heavier items (each can carry 15 lbs). The third shelf height works great with my IKEA desk for a printer with enough clearance to lift my printer and scan items. This works great for storage and for displaying momentos."
20275814,Easy assembly. Very easy to assemble and extremely sturdy
30275861,"Great piece of furniture. Of all the brands of 4 by 4 cube organizers you could get, IKEA’s is the best quality."
19931865,"Minimal, modern beauty. Great quality.. When anchored to the wall it is very sturdy. Anchoring is a must. Metal construction feels high end. I have had this in my child’s nursery room for the last 2 years and it is perfect for combination of display shelving, storage (with drawers) and book storage. Love the minimalist and versatile design."
60333954,"Nice looking. It was a bit tough to put together by myself, but I managed. One part didn’t 100% slide into place, but once all set up, it’s hardly noticeable."
20278167,I love the whole Kallax system.. I have being buying Kallax for years. I keep adding doors and drawers over time to keep clutter out of sight but leave some spaces open for things that I want to display. You can use as a room divider or cover a whole wall with storage as I did. The core is filled with recycled corrugated cardboard so units are not too heavy. Of course you should always anchor the unit to the wall or ceiling.
10305741,"Perfect piece for my new boutique!. I plan to use these in a commercial installation; and, they are just what I'm looking for! I will add feet to give them a custom look!"
20409936,"Perfect fit!. I needed a replacement for my entertainment center and found the Kallax 4x3 to be exactly what I was looking for. It fits perfectly under our TV and hold records, collectibles and blankets. I put it together by myself in 1-2 hours. Excellent materials and easy directions! I love buying and building Ikea furniture!"
70332124,"Terrible construction. Love the idea of EKET, but the pegs and holes are so poorly made nothing actually fits together very well. You have to put your entire body weight on every piece to make it fit. 3 pegs broke completely away from the unit and it is useless. These are not worth even $5."
99017186,"Great versatility. I have two because I love that you can have them tall or wide, they can be used for so many things and are great storage. Easy to put together, highly recommend!"
10345073,Great added storage!. We use KALAX shelves in both of my kids bedrooms with toy boxes and as bookshelves. This basket looks very discreet but elegant and provides additional storage for their everyday items. Great quality! Installs in seconds.
00275848,Simple and clean. Very sturdy and easy to assemble. Great value for the price. Using as a base for a bench in daughter's room. Great for storage.
10275862,"Easy to assemble. I was somewhat surprised by how easily and quickly my boyfriend and I were able to put this unit together. It seems very sturdy, and it is just the right size to hold his sizable board game collection."
70339291,"Earthy and Elegant. I bought three of these for my new wellness/fitness studio. They line up next to each other perfectly (because of the adjustable feet). Lots of studios use Kallax shelving, so I like that I have a different look. I had no difficulty building them but I am somewhat handy. I would say they are a bit more complex to build than other Ikea pieces."
40275846,Kalax Shelf Perfect Fit!. I was trying to find another shelving unit to match the TV set that I also bought at IKEA and it matches perfectly! Height and color! They look great and my girlfriend and I love it!
80275887,"Never too many bookshelves!. We bought this nearly a month ago for use in my eldest daughter’s bedroom. She had shorter desks she had outgrown, and with the need for her to have time to intensely focus for a couple of her school subjects, hooking a desktop to these shelves and have all of her books and binders available to slide right out onto her desk has been perfect! (We homeschool, so we have a LOT of books!)  We have two of this same shelving units in black/brown and two larger, and 4x4 and 5x5 in the black/brown. I was thrilled to see that they finally made this in the white!"
80275887,"Good for what I wanted. I have three of these units. They are super easy to assemble, provide excellent storage space and I can find more than one more place to put another one."
99306860,"Great storage combo!. I am so happy with my purchase of this storage combination. I am using it in my entryway so that there are drawers for hats/mittens, and storage for other items in the upper pieces for me. These were all easy to put together. I know some comments on the upper piece with the doors said that they couldn't get them to align properly. Mine align perfectly. I had to play with it a little bit, but they are perfectly aligned and fully functional. This set looks so clean and sleek and it's so easy to use for the kiddos. Perfect addition to my home. I purchased in the dark gray. Take your time to put the pieces together and follow the instructions - just like any IKEA product - and you'll be just fine. I'm contemplating buying more of these pieces for other parts of my home."
00415599,"Very sturdy. It fits in very well , I used it with the lack shelves"
40275846,Tv stand. Purchased for a tv stand for 55 inch tv and it is perfect size and looks great.
70483274,"Love it, completed the space. Love it, completed the space perfectly."
20275814,I'm sorry Ikea. I had a bad day and was assembling it wrong.
50481172,I used it for the. I used it for the laundry room. Super cute!
70301537,"Craft storage. Needed something for craft storage, this was perfect. I put it together myself, probably would’ve been easier with a second person especially at the end. Wish it had a back to it."
60275812,Great buy. Great buy
70342199,Good solid shelf unit.. Good solid shelf unit.
00415599,Easy to assemble. Durable and. Easy to assemble. Durable and it look very nice specially when paired with Kallax inserts.
29278304,Installing doors and drawers tricky. Should be a better system to install and adjust placement of hinges for doors and guide rails for drawers. They may end up not aligning equally between two sets especially after attaching screws. Fabric baskets are not uniform.
